      <title>Jail drugs 'easier to get than soap'</title>
      <description>The UK's largest privately-run prison is failing to tackle drugs, which inmates say are now easier to obtain than soap, a highly critical report reveals.</description>

      <body>The UK's largest privately-run prison is failing to tackle drugs, which inmates say are now easier to obtain than soap, a report reveals.Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick, said the findings on HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton, were "unquestionably concerning".One in seven prisoners said they had developed a drug problem while at the prison, the report found.Operator G4S said it had already taken steps to tackle the problems.The prison opened in April 2012 and houses about 1,600 inmates. The firm said that running a new jail was a challenging operation.Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, said the size of HMP Oakwood made the complex process of opening a new prison "even more acute".It is not the first time HMP Oakwood, a category C jail, has come under fire; in July it was one of two private prisons to receive the Ministry of Justice's lowest rating.At the time, the Howard League for Penal Reform described it as a "damning indictment" of the role of private firms in justice.Commenting on the latest report, the Howard League's chief executive, Frances Crook, said: "This private prison has been open for a year-and-a-half and it is getting worse, not better."On a payment-by-results model it would be closed because G4S are being paid for it and it is not delivering results."While there was praise from HMI Prisons for the facilities at HMP Oakwood, including accommodation, as well as its handling of segregation, there was also widespread criticism of many areas of prison life.In all four main tests - safety, respect, purposeful activity and resettlement - the prison was recorded as either insufficient or poor, the lowest rating.During an unannounced visit from 10-21 June, inspectors found a wide range of illicit drugs "were easily available" while drug usage was also high.Inspectors said that while positive drug test results were high, it was all the more concerning when the number of prisoners who refused tests was taken into account.As well as heroin and a synthetic drug, inspectors found prescribed medications also in circulation, with severe criticism of the healthcare department in the prison.The main healthcare provider - Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust - has been served with a statutory improvement notice by the Care Quality Commission following a critical report last month.Among the problems in that department highlighted by HMI Prisons was the "chaotic" administration of medications.While many inmates missed doses, inspectors said "tradable" medications were "routinely prescribed" with numerous opportunities for them to find their way into the prison population.The report said some effective counter measures were being introduced, but the prison "lacked a focused strategic approach to tackling drug supply and demand".In response, Mr Petherick from G4S said: "We have already taken steps to make improvements, appointing a dedicated taskforce to address problem areas, such as the prevalence of drugs, while providing additional funding where necessary. This is starting to yield results."Today we can see a reduction in the amount of drugs entering the establishment, the use of force is reducing and better care, sentence plans and resettlement arrangements for prisoners are being put in place."We are also working with the Ministry of Justice and the healthcare and education providers, who do not report to us, to address the issues raised in this report."HMP Oakwood's rehabilitation work with its 300 sex offenders was also highly criticised in the HMI report.Inspectors said there was no planned approach for addressing the behaviour of those inmates, many of whom "were in denial of their offending"."A large number of these prisoners were due for release without their offending having been addressed," the report said.Mr Hardwick said there was a lot to do "before Oakwood is operating anywhere near effectively".He added, however, that a new director had been appointed, who seemed to understand what needed to be done.Mr Petherick said: "We do not underestimate the effort which will be required to bring Oakwood up to the standard we have achieved at our other prisons."However, as the experience of staff develops, the regime becomes fully embedded and our reporting systems continue to improve, the months ahead will see significant further improvements in performance."All our staff are absolutely committed to helping Oakwood become a first-class facility which secures the very best outcomes for both prisoners and taxpayers."Director of the Prison Reform Trust, Juliet Lyon, said: "Slashing prison budgets while warehousing ever greater numbers overseen by largely inexperienced staff has come at a dangerous cost."This prison is not a model for the future but a warning."</body>

      <title>Clot woman told 'wear comfy shoes'</title>
      <description>A doctor who prescribed rest, ice and comfortable shoes for a woman who later died of a blood clot, was medically negligent, a coroner has ruled.</description>

      <body>A doctor who prescribed rest, ice, and comfortable shoes for a woman who later died of a blood clot, was medically negligent, a coroner has ruled.Jacqueline Allwood, 47, died 10 days later after a blood clot travelled from her leg to her lung.Dr Saurabh Adlakha knew of the family history of deep vein thrombosis, Southwark Coroner's Court heard.Recording a narrative verdict, medical negligence by Dr Adlakha contributed to her death, said coroner Andrew Harris.The inquest was told Dr Adlakha suggested Ms Allwood had probably suffered a sprained calf picking up Christmas decorations in December of 2012.After limping into the Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre she was told to take some ibuprofen, rest, use ice and stretch the muscle and to wear more comfortable shoes.But ten days later Ms Allwood died when a blood clot travelled to her lung."The consequences of missing a DVT are, as in this case, catastrophic," said Mr Harris.He referred Dr Adlakha to the General Medical Council for review.Outside court, Ms Allwood's daughters Tanya and Leanne Allwood said they were content with the outcome and although they did not want Dr Adlakha to be punished, they did want to believe he would learn from his mistake."We would never, never want to see another family go through what we have," Tanya Allwood said.Her mother had been "one of the most sincere, nicest people you could meet", she added.Dr Adlakha earlier told the hearing he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because "I don't want to be here again".</body>

      <title>MPs question economic case for HS2</title>
      <description>A committee of MPs concludes there are serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link will offer value for money.</description>

      <date>1381188013</date>
      <body>A committee of MPs has voiced serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link would offer the UK value for money.Members of the Treasury Committee said there were "serious shortcomings" in the current cost-benefit analysis for HS2.They said the economic case must be looked at again.A government spokesman said HS2 was vital for the UK to meet its "urgent capacity needs".HS2, which stands for High Speed Two, is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033.The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock.The Committee's report called for a more convincing case for HS2 from the Treasury."We need reassurance that it can deliver the benefits intended and that those benefits are greater than those of other transport schemes - whether in the department's project pipeline or not - which may be foregone," it said.The MPs said the government should formally reassess the project and proceed only once three criteria are met:The government spokesman said the project was on course, under control and would be delivered within the agreed budget."We are confident that our analysis is robust and conforms with government spending guidance," he said."The case for HS2 will be further improved when we publish shortly the updated strategic case - including cost-benefit analysis - which will show high value for money for the project."The HS2 plans have had the backing of all three main political leaders but are strongly opposed by some backbench MPs.However, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has hinted Labour might ditch the project over its cost if the party regains power.A recent report for HS2 Ltd found the project could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service.But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it said.</body>

      <description>Excessive pressure on A&amp;E consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.</description>

      <date>1381186852</date>
      <body>Excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.The College of Emergency Medicine said increased demand and the complexity of work was causing staff sickness and burnout.Its survey of just over 1,000 UK consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable.It comes amid mounting concern about the ability of AandE units to cope this winter.At the start of this year, the NHS in England missed its target of fewer than 5% of patients waiting more than four hours, as waiting times hit their highest rates for nine years.Ministers have since announced a £500m bailout fund for the next two winters to help those hospitals with the most acute problems.The college has always maintained that a shortage of doctors is a contributory factor to the problems.Previous reports have highlighted the fact that AandEs do not have enough consultants.The average is just over seven per unit when it should be 10 - and 16 for the largest hospitals - according to the college.But now the college is warning that the shortages are beginning to affect the consultants who are in place.In the survey, 94% complained they were working excessive hours - with more than half saying they were regularly doing more than a fifth extra on top of their contracted time.The report also uncovered a small, but growing problem with consultants emigrating.Last year 21 left the UK compared with three in 2008.College vice president Dr Taj Hassan said: "Senior medical decision-makers in emergency medicine provide one of the most vital strands in maintaining safety."A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis."Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the situation was "unacceptable"."Patients have incredible respect for emergency medicine teams, but those teams need to be backed up with the funding they need to do their jobs without being stretched in this way."A Department of Health spokesman commented: "We know we need to do more to support emergency departments to do their important work through winter and beyond."That is why we are investing £500m and we tasked Health Education England with developing plans to encourage more medical students to become AandE doctors in the future."He also said a major review of the urgent and emergency care system - led by medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh - would be reporting shortly.</body>

      <body>Repair work on a tunnel which collapsed beneath homes in Liverpool is starting later - more than 14 months after residents were evacuated.Eleven houses were declared unsafe after the disused railway tunnel in Dingle collapsed in July 2012.Deputy Mayor Paul Brant said he was sure the residents would be "pleased and relieved" work had started.The first phase is expected to last two weeks and involves testing the tunnel from the entrance to the collapse site.Liverpool City Council said it had "resolved outstanding legal issues" and awarded a contract to engineering firm SES Contracting.Families in the homes affected on Sundridge Street, Dingle Grove and Toxteth Grove have been living in temporary accommodation.Sundridge resident Maria Sullivan said: "There is still a long way to go."We have been told that even if the first phase goes ok there will be at least 12 weeks' work before we can go home - we won't be back by Christmas."Mr Brant added: "We spent a long time negotiating to get to this position and we are very aware that it has been an extremely frustrating and stressful time for the residents who have shown a great deal of understanding and patience."</body>

      <body>The Government has approved plans for a second tram crossing through the centre of Manchester.The crossing would mean extra capacity for trams and will link St Peter's Square with Victoria Station.Trams will travel along Princess Street, Cross Street and Corporation Street to reach Victoria.Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said the scheme was an essential part of the Metrolink expansion. It is expected to be complete by 2016/17.TfGM can now finalise arrangements for its plans which will see a larger tram stop in St Peter's Square and a new stop in Exchange Square.Councillor Andrew Fender, chair of the TfGM committee, said the second city crossing will play a "vital role in helping to build a strong and prosperous economy" for Greater Manchester."We're delighted that the order has been approved and we can now go ahead with appointing a contractor and making a start in the new year," he said."It's very necessary to give us the flexibility that having a second crossing will afford us."Construction work is due to start in 2014.</body>

      <body>Parking wardens in north Devon should wear uniforms in "friendly colours" and be nicer to people on the streets, a report has recommended.The suggestions are part of a special report by North Devon Council into car parking in the district.The councillor behind the idea has suggested that civil enforcement officers (CEOs) should wear maroon and white.The report also includes plans to review the price of Sunday parking.Councillor Frank Biederman, the chairman of the overview and scrutiny committee, said he would also like traffic wardens to be "ambassadors" for the town."I'd like to see them dressed in a more friendly colour, like maroon and white, they've got a smile on their face and people want to approach them for advice if they need it," Mr Biederman said.He said the public image of CEOs was that they were intended just to "dish out tickets"."I think that when people visit our towns and resort locations around north Devon it is nice for them to be met with a friendly face with people dressed in a friendlier manner," he said."It should attract people to approach them and for them to be as much an ambassador for the town."Mr Biederman suggested another possibility could be red if they were working in Barnstable, "as red is the colour of the town"."Just a colour that is more approachable, and not immediately saying this is an officialdom," he said.The reports also suggests that promotions are used to increase Sunday car park usage, and that Sunday prices should be reviewed.</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that new UK coins have been produced to mark a royal christening.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace - just over three months after his birth.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>Poyet named new Sunderland boss</title>
      <description>Sunderland announce former Brighton boss Gus Poyet as Paolo Di Canio's replacement as head coach at the Stadium of Light.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24441758</url>
      <date>1381221277</date>
      <body>Former Brighton boss Gus Poyet has been named as new Sunderland head coach on a two-year deal.The Black Cats lie bottom of the Premier League and sacked Paolo Di Canio in September after only 13 games.Poyet, 45, who was dismissed by the Seagulls in June, will be joined at the Stadium of Light by his Brighton backroom staff of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway.He becomes Sunderland's sixth manager in the past five years."We analysed a wide range of candidates and believe that Gus's track record, experience, commitment and passion make him the right man to take us forward," said Sunderland chairman Ellis Short.The club's senior professional development coach Kevin Ball had been in temporary charge of the club since Di Canio was relieved of his position following a player revolt at the club.Ball, 48, had asked to be considered for the job, but said following Sunderland's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday he did not expect to be doing another post-match news conference any time soon.Former Chelsea and Tottenham player Poyet, who was capped 26 times by his country, started his coaching career in England in 2006 as assistant to Dennis Wise at Swindon Town then Leeds United.He joined Spurs as first-team coach after one year at Elland Road, later becoming assistant manager to Juande Ramos.In 2009, he was appointed manager at Brighton, leading the south coast club to promotion from League One then taking them to last season's Championship play-off semi-final, where they were beaten by eventual winners Crystal Palace.He was suspended by Brighton in May after an internal investigation and disciplinary hearing and sacked a month later for gross misconduct.The full reasons for his sacking have not been revealed by either party, with Brighton saying the matter would stay confidential "to ensure and maintain confidentiality and dignity" after the former Chelsea midfielder's unsuccessful appeal against his dismissal.He said in August he was taking legal action against Brighton over the decision to dismiss him.Poyet, who has no experience of management in the top flight, made no secret of his interest in the job at the Stadium of Light, and recently said: "I planned that, over the first matches of this season, I would pay a lot of attention to the teams I thought could be in trouble."Of course, I watch Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester, but there was a group of teams who, if they didn't start well, I thought I could have a chance."I was watching Sunderland a lot. People were talking a lot about them in the summer because of Paolo and how many new players they had, so I have seen quite a lot of them."Poyet will be the fourth manager to have worked under owner and chairman Short, since the American businessman assumed 100% control of the club in 2009.Steve Bruce was sacked in November 2011 after two wins in the first 13 league games of that season, before successor Martin O'Neill suffered the same fate last March, with the Black Cats a point above the relegation zone.Di Canio replaced the Northern Irishman and helped Sunderland to wins over Newcastle and Everton, although the side failed to win any of their last three fixtures, finishing the season in 17th.The Italian manager spent £19m in the summer, but was sacked with the club bottom having picked up one point from the first five league games during the 2013-14 campaign.</body>

      <title>Injured Cole misses Montenegro clash</title>
      <description>Ashley Cole will miss England's World Cup qualifying match against Montenegro on Friday because of a rib injury.</description>

      <body>England left-back Ashley Cole will miss Friday's World Cup qualifier against Montenegro because of a rib injury.The 32-year-old was hurt during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Norwich, and has been replaced in manager Roy Hodgson's squad by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs.Cole, who has won 105 caps for the national team, will remain with Chelsea for more treatment.It is not yet clear whether he will be able to feature in England's last group game against Poland on 15 October.England need to win both matches at Wembley to guarantee World Cup qualification.Cole started England's last two World Cup qualifiers - a 0-0 draw with Ukraine on 10 September and a 4-0 win over Moldova four days earlier.His absence means Everton's Leighton Baines, who has won 19 caps and scored in England's 5-0 win over Moldova last year, is likely to start against Montenegro.Both of 24-year-old Gibbs's England appearances have come in friendlies.He made his international debut under previous manager Fabio Capello as a substitute in a 2-1 win against Hungary at Wembley in August 2010.Gibbs then played 72 minutes of England's 2-1 loss to France in November 2010.England are top of Group H with 16 points, one ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro.England must finish top of the group for automatic qualification for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil, while a second-placed finish would result in a two-legged play-off in November.Montenegro are expected to be without captain Mirko Vucinic, goalkeeper Mladen Bozovic, centre-back Marko Basa and midfielder Miodrag Pekovic against England because of injury.</body>

      <title>Can a fiver save the high street?</title>
      <description>Can just £5 a week help save your high street?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-24374320</url>

      <body>Online shopping and competition from out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets have long been cited as the reason so many British high streets are suffering. But can a project which challenges consumers to spend £5 locally finally turn the tide?A number of government schemes have been introduced to try and give shopping areas a boost, but what can towns do to help themselves?Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent is the latest to try out a scheme to get local people to spend £5 of their weekly shopping budget in their town centre instead of online or in chain stores.It currently has about 30 empty shops and has suffered since the closure of the Royal Doulton factory in 2005 and tourist attraction Ceramica shutting down in 2011.It is also two miles from Hanley which is seen as the retail centre for Stoke-on-Trent.Professor Jon Fairburn, from Staffordshire University's Business School, is helping to implement the social enterprise scheme called Totally Locally."The theory is if every adult living within one mile of Burslem town centre spends £5 with their local independent shops and businesses, it would be worth an extra £6m a year to the local economy," he said.But how realistic is that figure?Matthew Hopkinson, who is the director of the Local Data Company, which analyses retail trends, claims the scheme is "a gimmick."He said: "What you're trying to do is change consumer behaviour but even if they do it for one week they're probably not going to do it for 52 weeks a year."Businesses think if they can manipulate the consumer and their habits everything will be alright, but ultimately it can't be sustained."One town to already try the idea is the market town of Leek in the Staffordshire Moorlands.Three years ago it had a vacancy rate of 11% (about 30 shops) and charity shops occupied a number of units. That vacancy rate is now down to 6% (about 11 shops).Marc Briand, who leads the scheme, said it was set up as a reaction to the building of a new supermarket in the town in 2011."Switching £5 of your shopping budget is as simple as buying a sandwich from the local cafe at lunch or buying your weekly fruit and veg," he said."Out of that people then start to think about getting their car serviced at the local garage or buying clothes from local boutiques."The initial idea of making sure people spend that fiver has started to tail away but we've built on that to market the town in the right way and people keep coming back."Pop into Alison Szafranski's Market Kitchen Cafe in Stanley Street and she will point you in the right direction to buy a birthday gift or bottle of wine for a dinner party."It's about promoting all the businesses here, competition is healthy, but we are all about pulling together to make our businesses successful and Leek successful," she said.Mr Briand said it was "difficult to gauge" how successful the £5 spend scheme had been."Traders are quite cagey about what their profits are but shop keepers I know saw a definite upturn [in profits]," he said."Even taking it from a low vacancy rate...you can't say it hasn't had an affect."Traders in the smaller town of Eccleshall started the £5 spend scheme in January.Accountant Tim Hulse, who leads the project, said it was about bringing traders together rather than revitalising the high street."Eccleshall has always been a reasonably prosperous area because we've got a lot of so-called destination shops; a baby boutique, a speciality wedding shop, jewellers, and those bring people in," he said."I think it's the case of bringing a group of people together to put the effort in to promote any sort of campaign. Some traders have reported a 10 to 20% rise in turnover since we began."At WM Perry butchers on Stafford Street there are a stack of bones piled on a table outside for dog owners to take and a list of nearby farms where the shop's meat comes from.Owner Peter Bevan said: "I don't think you can dictate to someone how and where they spend their money but the important thing is we give them the service that keeps them coming back."I think that's what Eccleshall prides itself on, shopkeepers now know the customers names and faces and know exactly what they want."But the scheme would not suit all town centres, according to Mr Hulse.He said: "We're a small enough town not to need a massive major brand name and I think with the unique businesses we have, proximity drives footfall."It will be interesting to see how Burslem does, being so close to Stoke-on-Trent city centre and what it has to offer retail wise."Back in Burslem, some shops are getting a fresh coat of paint ahead of the launch of the £5 scheme on 12 October.Only time will tell if shoppers spending a weekly fiver will spark the town's revival.</body>

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <title>Ace cafe with quite a nice ancient monument attached?</title>
      <description>Have historic sites become all about the cafe and gift shop?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24335517</url>
      <date>1381130932</date>
      <body>English Heritage has announced that it is building a £27m visitor centre at Stonehenge, with what looks like a very large eating area. Is the cafe and gift shop almost as important as the attraction itself these days?Almost 50% of the shiny new visitor centre at Stonehenge will be taken up with a new "bright and spacious" cafe for up to 260 people and a bigger shop.It almost harks back to a memorable ad campaign by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1988, the museum commissioned a poster with the slogan: "Where else do they give you £100,000,000 worth of objets d'art free with every egg salad?"The poster was one of six, all describing the VandA as: "An ace caff, with quite a nice museum attached."It's a premise that won't surprise anyone who has visited a stately home or garden run by the National Trust recently. Some 19.2 million people made a trip last year. Many of those will have dutifully queued for a flapjack and a cup of tea. Or even a substantial meal.Food writer Giles Coren recalls visiting London Zoo as a child and caring more about the gift shop than the animals: "Thousands of school children, coachloads of them have to visit these places, and all they care about is the shop."He associates past visits to stately homes with rock-hard scones but thinks for many people it's increasingly all about the food. "It's like the Colosseum in Rome, people go all that way to see it only to discover it's a lot of boring old stones, but at least you can get an excellent pizza."Visitors now demand a nice place to eat, having put up with poor facilities for far too long, Coren suggests. "Everything in Britain has been rubbish for years and people won't put up with it anymore."There is scepticism among some about the new generation of visitor centres.TripAdvisor is full of reviews from people who are unimpressed. One reviewer was very upset when changes were made at a cathedral in East Anglia. "I love this cathedral, have been taking visitors to it for over 20 years… but it was so much nicer when you could walk in at the front. Now you have to go through a new visitors' centre, which adds nothing to your experience of visiting the cathedral, but does direct you past a desk for collecting your 'optional' entrance fee."Another visitor to a major modern art museum in London recalled: "We ordered their vegetable soup - a small bowl with watery soup containing some vegetables and a small hard roll (and we had to ask for some butter!) - 6.50 each! For us that's a rip-off and we were not impressed."But generally the trend is for the cafes in museums, galleries and castles to get better and better. And those in the heritage business see them as a happy synergy."A good shop and cafe greatly enhance the overall experience," says Matthew Tanner, chairman of the Association of Independent Museums. "No visit is complete without an interesting shop, a fine cup of tea, and not forgetting a good loo too."The argument for spending money on an extensive cafe is twofold - visitors have come to expect them, and the revenue raised helps subsidise the attraction.One place where this takes place is RHS Wisley in Surrey where the gift shop and cafe are the gatekeepers to the gardens people come to see. Nigel Eaton manages the shop and says it is part of the whole experience."We've got three kinds of customers - we have the RHS members who visit on a regular basis, the gardeners who come just for the plants and then we've got what we call the payers, who come on coaches for a nice day out. Every penny that is spent in the shop goes back into the RHS, so the shop is very important to us."Some 1.1 million people visit Wisley every year. The results of a customer survey revealed that 22% of those visitors came just for the "retail experience". Last year the shop - including one of the world's biggest gardening bookshops - made £3.8m and they expect to make an even bigger profit this year.As a Lonely Planet author, David Else has visited a lot of tourist attractions and has no problem with visitor centres. In fact he rather likes them."In the case of Stonehenge, a good visitor centre is going to tell you so much more about the history of what is essentially a group of old stones. I've got no problem with cafes, either - I like a good cup of tea after a visit and don't mind if they want to make a few bob to help preserve the site."In the heritage and art business it's all about making attractions "sustainable".Getting the shop and cafe right at an attraction is a win-win situation, says Jane Temperley from the Association for Cultural Enterprises. "Sure it is about generating income - everyone is looking at how to make their sites more sustainable. But research says visitors enjoy cafes and shops, happy visitors spend more and tend to become repeat visitors or members, which generates more income."About 80% of visitors to Wisley are RHS members so they come back to visit time and time again. Thirty-two staff work in the Wisley Shop and 60 staff work in the cafes and restaurants - that's over 25% of the total site staff of 350.And the staff at attraction are at pains to point out that the food has got better and better. Laurent Trenga is the chef responsible for the planning of menus at Wisley. He points out that a burger and chips at Wisley is no ordinary burger and chips. "Our burger is made from locally sourced quality pork and apples grown in our own orchards, even the bun is made fresh on site."The plants are rather nice too.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Statue plans for author scaled down</title>
      <description>Memorial for author Alan Sillitoe hit by fundraising difficulties</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-24369101</url>
      <date>1381154493</date>
      <body>Plans for a memorial in Nottingham to late author Alan Sillitoe have been scaled down because of difficulties in raising the money.A life-size statue of the Saturday Night and Sunday Morning writer was proposed in October 2010 and would have cost about £80,000.David Sillitoe, the novelist's son, said however, the expense has left the project unfeasible.Mr Sillitoe said a bust of his father had been planned instead.The Alan Sillitoe Statue Fund was set up following the death of the writer in April 2010.Sillitoe, who also penned The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, was born in the Lenton Abbey area of Nottingham, in 1928.The memorial was originally planned for his birthplace, but Old Market Square in the city centre later became its preferred location.David Sillitoe, who is on the committee, said: "We wanted to raise enough money to make a permanent memorial in Nottingham to Alan, [and] the obvious thing was a statue."[But] we had to measure our and other people's expectations and it's proven very hard to get that kind of money."The more we thought about it the less feasible the statue project was proving to be and that's why we moved sideways to the bust on a plinth."The group are still short of the money required, and a location for the bust has yet to be decided, he added.During the last three years an undisclosed amount of money has been collected through special events celebrating Sillitoe's life and work.Money through other sources has also been sought, and according to the fund the city council has pledged to support the tribute at the right time.However, Mr Sillitoe said he was disappointed the Arctic Monkeys, who are fans of his father's work, had not contributed.The band used a line uttered by anti-hero Arthur Seaton in the 1958 novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, for the title of their debut album - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not.Mr Sillitoe said: "The Arctic Monkeys haven't been any help and of course they took, for the title of that album, one of Alan's immortal lines, so we'd like to hear from them."[Alan Sillitoe] was acknowledged as an influence and I'm not necessarily saying there's a quid pro quo (this for that), but we contacted the management and in the great tradition of rock and roll their offer of help was to send us a CD, which never arrived."The band's management said it was unaware the CD had not arrived and invited Mr Sillitoe to get in touch about his campaign.Nottingham's last high-profile statue was for the late Brian Clough, which was unveiled in the Old Market Square, in 2008, after £70,000 was raised by volunteers within 18 months."They worked really hard to get the money," said Mr Sillitoe. "It was a great piece of fundraising."We're doing our best and we're grateful for anything. We're not asking for a lot [but] we need a leg up."</body>

      <title>Press plan for regulation 'rejected'</title>
      <description>Senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have rejected the press's own favoured version of a royal charter for press regulation, the BBC's Newsnight has learned.</description>

      <date>1381217527</date>
      <body>Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.A source said a sub-committee of the Privy Council, containing Lib Dem and Tory cabinet ministers, thought the proposals were "flawed".But sub-committee chair Danny Alexander insisted no decision had been made.The full Privy Council is also looking at an alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners.It is due to announce its decision on the press proposals on Wednesday and the alternative plan on 30 October.Press regulation options are being considered in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, which was set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Politicians and the press have been at odds over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the regulator.The government's proposals published in March have cross-party backing and the support of campaign group Hacked Off.There are a series of key differences between the industry's plan for press regulation and that agreed by politicians and campaigners.Newsnight's political editor Allegra Stratton was told Privy Council members felt proposals for self-regulation put forward by newspapers did not meet the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report.Mr Alexander, who told the BBC the sub-committee met on Monday and the full Privy Council will meet on Wednesday to consider the press proposal, said there were a "few remaining" details to be decided - but insisted "no final decision has been made".But ministers "do look set to reject" the form of regulation put forward by newspapers, BBC political editor Nick Robinson said.The Privy Council sub-committee sub-committee consists of four Tories and two Lib Dems - and both parties have been critical of the press proposals - he added.Steve Hewlett, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, told Newsnight that newspaper publishers felt the process had been far from transparent.He said: "People I have spoken to are furious and are now considering whether there might be a legal challenge to this decision by the Privy Council."The newspapers' proposals would:Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of the Sun, said the news was not a shock."It's what we'd been given fairly clear clues would happen," he said."I think it has to be seen as a great victory for the forces of oppression of a free press - Hacked Off in particular - and the politicians who have gone along for the ride."Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said the press's plan had been a "delaying manoeuvre" by the big national newspapers."The problem with the papers is that they do not want to deal fairly with complaints," he said.Mr Cathcart said there was a "rare unanimity" in Parliament on this issue, and the press was refusing to compromise "like an errant child on the naughty step with his fingers in his ears".He said only the press stood against the consensus in politics and the public which said: "We want Parliament's royal charter - Leveson's royal charter - and we want it now."Earlier, Gerry McCann said the newspaper industry's plans for press regulation were "a gentlemen's club agreement" and should be rejected by politicians.The father of missing Madeleine McCann said the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry were the "minimum acceptable".Mr McCann and his family were subject to intense press attention after Madeleine went missing while they were on holiday in Portugal in 2007.</body>

      <title>Help to Buy costs being unveiled</title>
      <description>Banks begin to unveil details of the mortgages they will offer under the government's expanded Help to Buy scheme.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24430010</url>
      <date>1381220487</date>
      <body>Banks have begun to unveil mortgages which they will offer under the expanded Help to Buy scheme.The government's initiative is designed to enable buyers who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC and Virgin Money joining later.There have been concerns the scheme could fuel a housing price bubble, but Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander told the BBC that there is no UK price boom."People who think that there's a housing bubble should get out more. They should get out of Kensington and Chelsea, and go to Manchester or Birmingham, and major towns across the country," he said.He said the scheme would help those people to who do not have "piles of cash" for a mortgage deposit.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.HSBC said it would join the scheme later in the year, and Virgin Money said it would offer Help to Buy mortgages from January.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is expected to be up to 0.9% of a property's sale price. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Those who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the Conservative Party conference that the second phase of the scheme would be brought forward by three months from January.A number of lenders have expressed an interest in joining the second phase. Lloyds Banking Group and RBS are the most prominent. Other lenders have yet to commit.Some products from the Halifax and Bank of Scotland will be available from Friday, with deals from other lenders expected to be in place by January.Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September.The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Mr Alexander said the Treasury Committee was right to say that Ministers should keep a close watch on Help to Buy. "We will make adjustments if they (the FPC) recommend them," he said.He also rejected criticism that the government should be tackling a house supply shortage, rather than demand. "All the housebuilders tell us is that what is holding them back (building more houses) is a lack of demand," he said. "There are lots of other policies that this government is doing to tackle demand."Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.</body>

      <description>Excessive pressure on A&amp;E consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.</description>

      <date>1381186852</date>
      <body>Excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.The College of Emergency Medicine said increased demand and the complexity of work was causing staff sickness and burnout.Its survey of just over 1,000 UK consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable.It comes amid mounting concern about the ability of AandE units to cope this winter.At the start of this year, the NHS in England missed its target of fewer than 5% of patients waiting more than four hours, as waiting times hit their highest rates for nine years.Ministers have since announced a £500m bailout fund for the next two winters to help those hospitals with the most acute problems.The college has always maintained that a shortage of doctors is a contributory factor to the problems.Previous reports have highlighted the fact that AandEs do not have enough consultants.The average is just over seven per unit when it should be 10 - and 16 for the largest hospitals - according to the college.But now the college is warning that the shortages are beginning to affect the consultants who are in place.In the survey, 94% complained they were working excessive hours - with more than half saying they were regularly doing more than a fifth extra on top of their contracted time.The report also uncovered a small, but growing problem with consultants emigrating.Last year 21 left the UK compared with three in 2008.College vice president Dr Taj Hassan said: "Senior medical decision-makers in emergency medicine provide one of the most vital strands in maintaining safety."A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis."Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the situation was "unacceptable"."Patients have incredible respect for emergency medicine teams, but those teams need to be backed up with the funding they need to do their jobs without being stretched in this way."A Department of Health spokesman commented: "We know we need to do more to support emergency departments to do their important work through winter and beyond."That is why we are investing £500m and we tasked Health Education England with developing plans to encourage more medical students to become AandE doctors in the future."He also said a major review of the urgent and emergency care system - led by medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh - would be reporting shortly.</body>

      <body>The UK's largest privately-run prison is failing to tackle drugs, which inmates say are now easier to obtain than soap, a report reveals.Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick, said the findings on HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton, were "unquestionably concerning".One in seven prisoners said they had developed a drug problem while at the prison, the report found.Operator G4S said it had already taken steps to tackle the problems.The prison opened in April 2012 and houses about 1,600 inmates. The firm said that running a new jail was a challenging operation.Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, said the size of HMP Oakwood made the complex process of opening a new prison "even more acute".It is not the first time HMP Oakwood, a category C jail, has come under fire; in July it was one of two private prisons to receive the Ministry of Justice's lowest rating.At the time, the Howard League for Penal Reform described it as a "damning indictment" of the role of private firms in justice.Commenting on the latest report, the Howard League's chief executive, Frances Crook, said: "This private prison has been open for a year-and-a-half and it is getting worse, not better."On a payment-by-results model it would be closed because G4S are being paid for it and it is not delivering results."While there was praise from HMI Prisons for the facilities at HMP Oakwood, including accommodation, as well as its handling of segregation, there was also widespread criticism of many areas of prison life.In all four main tests - safety, respect, purposeful activity and resettlement - the prison was recorded as either insufficient or poor, the lowest rating.During an unannounced visit from 10-21 June, inspectors found a wide range of illicit drugs "were easily available" while drug usage was also high.Inspectors said that while positive drug test results were high, it was all the more concerning when the number of prisoners who refused tests was taken into account.As well as heroin and a synthetic drug, inspectors found prescribed medications also in circulation, with severe criticism of the healthcare department in the prison.The main healthcare provider - Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust - has been served with a statutory improvement notice by the Care Quality Commission following a critical report last month.Among the problems in that department highlighted by HMI Prisons was the "chaotic" administration of medications.While many inmates missed doses, inspectors said "tradable" medications were "routinely prescribed" with numerous opportunities for them to find their way into the prison population.The report said some effective counter measures were being introduced, but the prison "lacked a focused strategic approach to tackling drug supply and demand".In response, Mr Petherick from G4S said: "We have already taken steps to make improvements, appointing a dedicated taskforce to address problem areas, such as the prevalence of drugs, while providing additional funding where necessary. This is starting to yield results."Today we can see a reduction in the amount of drugs entering the establishment, the use of force is reducing and better care, sentence plans and resettlement arrangements for prisoners are being put in place."We are also working with the Ministry of Justice and the healthcare and education providers, who do not report to us, to address the issues raised in this report."HMP Oakwood's rehabilitation work with its 300 sex offenders was also highly criticised in the HMI report.Inspectors said there was no planned approach for addressing the behaviour of those inmates, many of whom "were in denial of their offending"."A large number of these prisoners were due for release without their offending having been addressed," the report said.Mr Hardwick said there was a lot to do "before Oakwood is operating anywhere near effectively".He added, however, that a new director had been appointed, who seemed to understand what needed to be done.Mr Petherick said: "We do not underestimate the effort which will be required to bring Oakwood up to the standard we have achieved at our other prisons."However, as the experience of staff develops, the regime becomes fully embedded and our reporting systems continue to improve, the months ahead will see significant further improvements in performance."All our staff are absolutely committed to helping Oakwood become a first-class facility which secures the very best outcomes for both prisoners and taxpayers."Director of the Prison Reform Trust, Juliet Lyon, said: "Slashing prison budgets while warehousing ever greater numbers overseen by largely inexperienced staff has come at a dangerous cost."This prison is not a model for the future but a warning."</body>

      <title>Lampedusa death toll climbs to 232</title>
      <description>Italian divers "unpack a wall of people" from the sunken hull of a boat carrying African migrants that sank off Lampedusa island on Thursday.</description>

      <body>Italian divers have recovered dozens more bodies from a boat carrying African migrants that sank on Thursday.Thirty-eight bodies were freed from the hull, which divers had previously been unable to access. The official death toll now stands at 232.Divers "unpacked a wall of people", a navy officer said, adding that corpses were "so entwined one with the other" they were difficult to pull out.The boat caught fire and capsized close to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa.There were 155 survivors of the accident, which happened about 1km (half a mile) offshore.The operation to recover bodies from the hull was abandoned for the night, but will resume on Tuesday.,Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but last week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.The wreck is lying about 47m (155ft) below the surface, which means the recovery divers can only stay on the bottom for a short time.All the bodies around the ship and on deck have been brought to the surface, police say, however dozens more are thought to remain inside the vessel."I'm sure that the most difficult part of the operation is starting now. Technically it will be much more challenging," Coast Guard diver Rocco Pilon told Reuters news agency.Navy Captain Paolo Trucco said that debris had to be removed from the passageways leading to the hull."Mattresses, blankets, stairs. Anything that would float. Imagine if you put a house in a centrifuge and you see what winds up in the air. That is what happened," Mr Trucco told the Associated Press."Some [bodies] we have found with their arms outstretched. We try not to notice this kind of thing too much, otherwise the task is too difficult," said police diver Riccardo Nobile."We can see a woman's hair floating out of a broken porthole. But we haven't been able to get to her."The 20m (66ft) boat was carrying more than 500 people, mostly from Eritrea and Somalia.The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.The offence carries a 5,000-euro (£4,230; $6,780) fine.Italy has said it will amend its immigration laws. The authorities have denied allegations that they were slow to mount a rescue.France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.</body>

      <title>Fusion milestone passed at US lab</title>
      <description>Researchers at a US lab have passed a crucial milestone on the way to their ultimate goal of achieving self-sustaining nuclear fusion.</description>

      <date>1381181157</date>
      <body>Researchers at a US lab have passed a crucial milestone on the way to their ultimate goal of achieving self-sustaining nuclear fusion.Harnessing fusion - the process that powers the Sun - could provide an unlimited and cheap source of energy.But to be viable, fusion power plants would have to produce more energy than they consume, which has proven elusive.Now, a breakthrough by scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) could boost hopes of scaling up fusion.NIF, based at Livermore in California, uses 192 beams from the world's most powerful laser to heat and compress a small pellet of hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place.The BBC understands that during an experiment in late September, the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel - the first time this had been achieved at any fusion facility in the world.This is a step short of the lab's stated goal of "ignition", where nuclear fusion generates as much energy as the lasers supply. This is because known "inefficiencies" in different parts of the system mean not all the energy supplied through the laser is delivered to the fuel.But the latest achievement has been described as the single most meaningful step for fusion in recent years, and demonstrates NIF is well on its way towards the coveted target of ignition and self-sustaining fusion.For half a century, researchers have strived for controlled nuclear fusion and been disappointed. It was hoped that NIF would provide the breakthrough fusion research needed.In 2009, NIF officials announced an aim to demonstrate nuclear fusion producing net energy by 30 September 2012. But unexpected technical problems ensured the deadline came and went; the fusion output was less than had originally been predicted by mathematical models.Soon after, the $3.5bn facility shifted focus, cutting the amount of time spent on fusion versus nuclear weapons research - which was part of the lab's original mission.However, the latest experiments agree well with predictions of energy output, which will provide a welcome boost to ignition research at NIF, as well as encouragement to advocates of fusion energy in general.It is markedly different from current nuclear power, which operates through splitting atoms - fission - rather than squashing them together in fusion.NIF, based at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of several projects around the world aimed at harnessing fusion. They include the multi-billion-euro ITER facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.However, ITER will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the Cadarache facility will use magnetic fields to contain the hot fusion fuel - a concept known as magnetic confinement.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>Post-Yes defence plan 'would cost'</title>
      <description>The UK government believes establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24437333</url>
      <date>1381221742</date>
      <body>The UK government believes that establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.The claim will appear in the latest Coalition analysis paper prepared by UK civil servants.The Scottish government proposes a £2.5bn defence force if there is a "yes" vote next September.A spokesman said an independent Scotland would have first-class conventional forces.Meanwhile the BBC has seen an internal Ministry of Defence (MoD) briefing document on Scottish independence.It raised concerns about the effect a "yes" vote would have on England, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying the debate matters because of the potential effect of Scottish independence on "our politics, our economy, our standing" - referring to the rest of UK.The document also suggested that about 500,000 votes could "swing the result" of the referendum "either way".Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will promote the UK's current defence set-up during a speech in Edinburgh later.The 86-page analysis paper is being published after MPs on the Commons Defence Committee said it would be "remiss" of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) not to consider the implications of independence, including the future of Trident at the Faslane base.The document will focus on funding, jobs and the problems involved in splitting up an integrated military.The report concludes that the transition to an independent force would be complex.One extract from the analysis says: "Adapting the functions of Scotland's defence footprint would result in a substantial burden on the public finances of an independent Scottish state during establishment, and duplication of costs thereafter for the essential services currently provided on a UK-wide basis."It is difficult to predict how long the establishment phase would last, but given the complex, integrated nature of the UK armed forces and the absence of command and control structures and other essential components in Scotland, this would not be an easy process."Even basic re-design of military bases is a costly undertaking requiring substantial investment to cater for different operational needs."It added that negotiations over assets and liabilities such as equipment, basing and other infrastructure "would be difficult".The report also said that the issue of personnel would present an "extremely difficult challenge to overcome".However, the MoD said picking the UK military apart "would not be impossible".A Scottish government spokesman said he welcomed the "important acknowledgement" from the UK government that an independent Scotland would stand to "inherit a fair share of current UK defence assets".He added: "An independent Scotland will have first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and co-operating with international partners - but we will not waste billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons."We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane, which will be Scotland's main conventional naval facility, and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases."</body>

      <title>Hope for malaria vaccine by 2015</title>
      <description>UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will seek approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trials showed that it had reduced cases in African children.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24431510</url>
      <date>1381206650</date>
      <body>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is seeking regulatory approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trial data showed that it had cut the number of cases in African children.Experts say that they are optimistic about the possibility of the world's first vaccine after the trial results.Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide every year.Scientists say an effective vaccine is key to attempts to eradicate it.The vaccine known as RTS,S was found to have almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children in the trial and to have reduced by about 25% the number of malaria cases in infants.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing RTS,S with the non-profit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals," said Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso."Progress is being made with bed nets and other measures, but we need more tools to battle this terrible disease."The malaria trial was Africa's largest-ever clinical trial involving almost 15,500 children in seven countries.The findings were presented at a medical meeting in Durban, South Africa."Based on these data, GSK now intends to submit, in 2014, a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," GSK said in a statement.The company has been developing the vaccine for three decades.The statement said that the hope now is that the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) may recommend the use of the RTS,S vaccine from as early as 2015 if EMA drugs regulators back its licence application.Testing showed that 18 months after vaccination, children aged five to 17 months had a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated contemporaries.But in infants aged six to 12 weeks at the time of vaccination, there was only a 27% reduction in risk.A spokeswoman for GSK told the AFP news agency that the company would file its application to the EMA under a process aimed at facilitating new drugs for poorer countries.</body>

      <title>Too many pupils 'failures at seven'</title>
      <description>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, says a report from Save the Children</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24434515</url>
      <date>1381194837</date>
      <body>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, a charity has warned.Save the Children analysed 2012 data on the performance of pupils at schools in England.It shows the poorest pupils are less likely to have made good progress than their better-off peers.The charity's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: "Many children starting school this term already have the odds stacked against them."In his foreword to the report, he writes "Seven is too young to write off a child," but he adds that without good reading skills "all other subjects are a closed book".The report cites official figures that suggest that by the age of seven the future gap in GCSE results between rich and poor children has already been established.In 2012, about 13% of seven-year-olds, or 76,000 pupils, were not at the expected reading level.Underlying this figure is the achievement gap between children on free school meals and their classmates. Almost a quarter (24%) of children eligible for free meals did not reach the expected level, compared with only 10% of children from better-off families.A different set of figures from the 2012 National Pupil Database shows that fewer than a sixth of pupils who had fallen behind at the age of seven caught up to meet the benchmark of five GCSEs graded A* to C at the age of 16.This suggests that 84% of children who fail to meet expected standards in reading and mathematics at seven are likely to continue to struggle throughout their school careers.The authors recognise "steady and welcome progress" over the past five years on the number of seven-year-olds who can read and write to the expected level.Their analysis has found that even continuing to make this rate of progress between now and 2020 could still leave almost half a million children having fallen behind in their reading by the age of seven.They add that continued progress may be difficult to achieve so even these figures may be optimistic without "bold policy change".Calculations based on lower rates of progress suggest that between 520,000 and 810,000 children could have fallen behind by 2020.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "It is utterly unacceptable that so many disadvantaged children leave primary school without a firm grounding in the basics of reading, writing and maths and that is why we are urgently reforming primary education and giving specific support to disadvantaged pupils."This included the pupil premium paid to schools to support poorer pupils, the phonics test and the "rigorous new primary curriculum" which would mean that "many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers."Save the Children is launching a programme called Born to Read, aiming to help about 23,000 children in England to read over the next four years.</body>

      <title>Spending cuts fear ahead of budget</title>
      <description>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.</description>

      <body>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.Local councils have already been warned they will be exposed to more cuts than in previous years.A Welsh government source said ministers were preparing to deliver "the toughest budget since devolution".However, BBC Wales understands a budget deal with the opposition could be announced as early as Tuesday.Without an overall majority in the assembly, Labour will need an agreement from the opposition to approve its spending plans, worth about £15bn.John Rae, director of resources with the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We estimate we are facing cuts of around 4% after the local government minister warned us we'd be looking at English-style reductions."Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said there had been "a level of protection" to local government in Wales, and a study had shown that until now councils in Wales probably had taken "half the cut that councils in England had faced".He added that all the councils in Wales had their own priorities, but services in "discretionary areas" such as leisure, culture, planning, libraries, highways, street lights and economic development would be affected.The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for not protecting the health budget against inflation.Spending on the NHS has been frozen in recent years - meaning it has been cut in real terms after taking account of inflation.A review of the health budget was carried out over the summer.Speaking ahead of the draft budget, shadow finance minister Paul Davies AM criticised the situation in the NHS in Wales where "patients are routinely waiting over four hours to be seen in AandE".He added: "For the sake of our NHS, Carwyn Jones must use this draft budget to reverse Labour's damaging health cuts."In the last two years, Labour has done separate budget deals with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.This year, Plaid and the Lib Dems have joined forces to negotiate a deal with the government.An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said the UK government's block grant to Wales in 2013/14 would be around 9.4% smaller in real terms than it was in 2010/11.More cuts announced for the two years after that would take the reduction to 12.2%.</body>

      <body>The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.From January, instead of vowing "to do my duty to God", scouts will be able to promise to "uphold our scout values".The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.The Church of England and other faiths have welcomed the move, which follows a 10 month consultation."I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish", said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people."In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life".This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to "my Dharma" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its "determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society".Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: "Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have."Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive."The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girlsLast month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.</body>

      <body>Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has criticised the prime minister for comments he made about how Britain will mark the centenary of World War I.David Cameron said he wanted to see a "commemoration that, like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, says something about who we are as a people".Paxman told the Radio Times that centenary events should "have almost nothing in common" with the Jubilee.He spoke of concerns the centenary could become a "celebration of war".Mr Cameron's comments were made in a speech at the Imperial War Museum in London in October last year.He promised a "truly national commemoration" to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war - in 2014, Armistice Day in 2018, and the dates of major battles in between.Paxman, whose great uncle died in the war, said that "not to acknowledge the war's significance would be wilful myopia", but that "the whole catastrophe has been overlain with myth and legend".But the 63-year-old, who also presents University Challenge, said the Jubilee was "an excuse for a knees-up in the rain to celebrate the happy fact that our national identity is expressed through a family rather than some politician who wants the job to gratify his vanity"."A number of distinguished fellow citizens, like the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy and the thoughtful musician Brian Eno, are worried that the events will turn into a celebration of war. Only a moron would 'celebrate' the war," he added.He added: "We shouldn't 'celebrate' the outbreak of the First World War. But not to recognise that it was one of the most consequential events in our history would just be perverse."The prime minister used the speech to announce that more than £50m has been allocated for a "historic" commemoration of World War I.</body>

A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that new UK coins have been produced to mark a royal christening.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace - just over three months after his birth.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>Poyet named new Sunderland boss</title>
      <description>Sunderland announce former Brighton boss Gus Poyet as Paolo Di Canio's replacement as head coach at the Stadium of Light.</description>

      <date>1381221277</date>
      <body>Former Brighton boss Gus Poyet has been named as new Sunderland head coach on a two-year deal.The Black Cats lie bottom of the Premier League and sacked Paolo Di Canio in September after only 13 games.Poyet, 45, who was dismissed by the Seagulls in June, will be joined at the Stadium of Light by his Brighton backroom staff of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway.He becomes Sunderland's sixth manager in the past five years."We analysed a wide range of candidates and believe that Gus's track record, experience, commitment and passion make him the right man to take us forward," said Sunderland chairman Ellis Short.The club's senior professional development coach Kevin Ball had been in temporary charge of the club since Di Canio was relieved of his position following a player revolt at the club.Ball, 48, had asked to be considered for the job, but said following Sunderland's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday he did not expect to be doing another post-match news conference any time soon.Former Chelsea and Tottenham player Poyet, who was capped 26 times by his country, started his coaching career in England in 2006 as assistant to Dennis Wise at Swindon Town then Leeds United.He joined Spurs as first-team coach after one year at Elland Road, later becoming assistant manager to Juande Ramos.In 2009, he was appointed manager at Brighton, leading the south coast club to promotion from League One then taking them to last season's Championship play-off semi-final, where they were beaten by eventual winners Crystal Palace.He was suspended by Brighton in May after an internal investigation and disciplinary hearing and sacked a month later for gross misconduct.The full reasons for his sacking have not been revealed by either party, with Brighton saying the matter would stay confidential "to ensure and maintain confidentiality and dignity" after the former Chelsea midfielder's unsuccessful appeal against his dismissal.He said in August he was taking legal action against Brighton over the decision to dismiss him.Poyet, who has no experience of management in the top flight, made no secret of his interest in the job at the Stadium of Light, and recently said: "I planned that, over the first matches of this season, I would pay a lot of attention to the teams I thought could be in trouble."Of course, I watch Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester, but there was a group of teams who, if they didn't start well, I thought I could have a chance."I was watching Sunderland a lot. People were talking a lot about them in the summer because of Paolo and how many new players they had, so I have seen quite a lot of them."Poyet will be the fourth manager to have worked under owner and chairman Short, since the American businessman assumed 100% control of the club in 2009.Steve Bruce was sacked in November 2011 after two wins in the first 13 league games of that season, before successor Martin O'Neill suffered the same fate last March, with the Black Cats a point above the relegation zone.Di Canio replaced the Northern Irishman and helped Sunderland to wins over Newcastle and Everton, although the side failed to win any of their last three fixtures, finishing the season in 17th.The Italian manager spent £19m in the summer, but was sacked with the club bottom having picked up one point from the first five league games during the 2013-14 campaign.</body>

      <body>Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy says Joe Hart deserves to be England's number one goalkeeper and believes unfair scrutiny of players will affect England's chances of success.Hart, 26, was criticised for his errors in Manchester City's defeats by Cardiff, Aston Villa and Bayern Munich."Joe's the England number one. Rightly so," said Ruddy, one of Hart's two understudies in the England squad."He doesn't warrant that sort of attention. He's a top-drawer keeper."The focus on Hart increased after his mistakes led to two of Bayern's goals in his team's 3-1 Champions League defeat by the reigning champions at Etihad Stadium last week.But England manager Roy Hodgson has said the player is his first-choice goalkeeper for the World Cup qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland, to be played at Wembley on Friday and next Tuesday respectively.Ruddy, who is Hart's rival for the goalkeeping spot along with Fraser Forster, has added his support, admitting he sympathised with Hart."I've been in situations before when people are questioning you. It's never nice," added Ruddy."Without being too patronising, I felt sorry for him."It's the way the media is. You build people up so far and then chop their legs away when they get too high."Unfortunately that's the way the English media goes. Until that stops we might struggle to go anywhere in competitions."Hart's failure to stop routine shots from Bayern's Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben came a few days after he was slow to react for Andreas Weimann's winner in Villa's 3-2 Premier League win.He was also beaten at a corner by Cardiff striker Fraizer Campbell in August and allowed a shot from James Morrison to go underneath him during England's 3-2 victory against Scotland at Wembley in August."Nine times out of 10 when a keeper makes a mistake, the ball goes in the back of the net," said Ruddy."It's a tough world but every keeper is mentally strong enough to deal with that."We're a strange bunch, but you have to be. The self-confidence and self-belief that you have as an individual has to be right up there."</body>

      <title>Vettel dominance bores fans - Hamilton</title>
      <description>Lewis Hamilton says he fears Formula 1 fans will lose interest in the sport because Sebastian Vettel is so dominant.</description>

      <body>Britain's former world champion Lewis Hamilton says he fears Formula 1 fans will lose interest in the sport because Sebastian Vettel is so dominant.Vettel, 26, is on the brink of a fourth consecutive world championship after winning the Korean Grand Prix.Hamilton said he did not watch races when Michael Schumacher dominated."I remember waking up to watch the start of the race then going to sleep and waking up when it ended because I knew what would happen," said Hamilton."I am pretty sure a lot of people are doing that today."Vettel can secure the title at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday if he wins at Suzuka and rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari is lower than eighth.Fans have repeatedly booed the German as he celebrated victories on the podium, but Hamilton, who has fallen to fourth in the standings, insists the Red Bull driver deserves to win the title."He has driven well all year," said the 28-year-old. "I've just looked at his points and he has had second, first, second, first all year. He's done the perfect job and he deserves it."Vettel is 77 points clear of Alonso after winning more than half the races this season and could clinch the championship with four grands prix to go.He has won eight races, Alonso and Nico Rosberg have won two while Hamilton's only success came at the Hungarian Grand Prix.Vettel's reliability has seen him finish on the podium in two thirds of grands prix for the last four seasons but his best performance was in 2011 when he won 11 of the 19 races from 15 pole positions and only failed to make the podium on two occasions.In contrast, Hamilton has won 13 races since claiming his only world title in 2008.Vettel's record is similar to Schumacher's, who won five world titles between 2000 and 2004, winning 48 of 85 grands prix.And Red Bull team principal Christian Horner believes he deserves to be ranked alongside the greatest drivers of all time."He has to be right up there - he has to be," said Horner."The level he is performing at is unbelievable in many respects."We know Mark [Webber, Red Bull team-mate] is a very talented and quick racing driver and matching him against that, he has been hugely impressive."What has been really impressive is he has continued to grow and improve as he has gained more experience, and to have won the ratio of races he has is remarkable."</body>

      <body>England left-back Ashley Cole will miss Friday's World Cup qualifier against Montenegro because of a rib injury.The 32-year-old was hurt during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Norwich, and has been replaced in manager Roy Hodgson's squad by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs.Cole, who has won 105 caps for the national team, will remain with Chelsea for more treatment.It is not yet clear whether he will be able to feature in England's last group game against Poland on 15 October.England need to win both matches at Wembley to guarantee World Cup qualification.Cole started England's last two World Cup qualifiers - a 0-0 draw with Ukraine on 10 September and a 4-0 win over Moldova four days earlier.His absence means Everton's Leighton Baines, who has won 19 caps and scored in England's 5-0 win over Moldova last year, is likely to start against Montenegro.Both of 24-year-old Gibbs's England appearances have come in friendlies.He made his international debut under previous manager Fabio Capello as a substitute in a 2-1 win against Hungary at Wembley in August 2010.Gibbs then played 72 minutes of England's 2-1 loss to France in November 2010.England are top of Group H with 16 points, one ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro.England must finish top of the group for automatic qualification for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil, while a second-placed finish would result in a two-legged play-off in November.Montenegro are expected to be without captain Mirko Vucinic, goalkeeper Mladen Bozovic, centre-back Marko Basa and midfielder Miodrag Pekovic against England because of injury.</body>

      <title>UK upturn 'is gathering momentum'</title>
      <description>British Chambers of Commerce survey says the UK recovery is gaining pace, while a British Retail Consortium report underlines that some sectors remain fragile.</description>

      <date>1381220184</date>
      <body>UK companies saw sales and optimism jump in the third quarter, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).Service firms saw UK sales and orders rise at the fastest pace since 2007, while the rises for manufacturing were the sharpest since the early 1990s."It's clear that the UK upturn is gathering momentum," said David Kern, BCC chief economist.But a British Retail Consortium survey showed UK retail sales slowed for a second consecutive month in September."These figures are a reality check and will make retailers nervous as we enter the run up to Christmas," said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, which helped compile the BRC data.The British Chambers of Commerce said the results of its quarterly survey mean that it was likely to revise up its GDP forecasts for 2014.The quarterly survey is based based on responses from 7,400 companies, making it the UK's largest business survey.On the basis of the results, the BCC estimates that GDP growth will be in the region of 0.9% and 1% in the third quarter.The survey reported that employment prospects are brighter. A balance of 26% of services firms planned to increase staffing in the next three months, the highest reading since 2007.For manufacturing, the reading was 29%, the highest since the survey began in 1989.The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said in a statement: "It is fantastic to see our small yet dynamic manufacturing sector doing so well, with our results suggesting a recent growth spurt."However, we need to ensure that this does not become an aberration, but rather the norm, particularly when the economic recovery is still facing external risks."He said that levels of investment were still a concern, and that more support was needed for exporters through increased trade promotion and better access to finance."The Government mustn't get distracted, and has to put growth first at all times," Mr Longworth said."We will be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement in the hope that the chancellor uses this opportunity to make a real difference and go all out in the name of growth," he said.Meanwhile, the BRC data showed that like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in floor space as retailers open and close outlets - rose 0.7% in September. This was less than half the rate of growth of the previous two months.Grocery sales showed a weak performance in September, although sales of children's clothing and shoes put in a strong showing, due to the tail-end of the traditional back-to-school spending spree.The BRC said that a slowdown in food and drink sales reflected the tough battleground for market share. And the warm weather had also put people off spending on winter clothes."Consumers are still cautious about spending and are reluctant to restock their wardrobes with winter woollies until the weather cools," Mr McCorquodale said in a statement.The survey underlines that some sectors remain weak, despite a recent run of strong economic data.Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Morrisons and Next, remain cautious about the strength of the UK recovery.</body>

      <title>EU exit would be suicide, says Clegg</title>
      <description>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union and supporters must "speak up", Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <date>1381220882</date>
      <body>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union, Nick Clegg has warned.The deputy PM said a new "coalition in the national interest" was needed to make the case for membership, and asked businesses and charities to help.He attacked David Cameron's proposed referendum, calling it a "short-sighted political calculation" which could see the UK "stumble out" of the EU.Eurosceptic group Business for Britain accused Mr Clegg of "scaremongering".In a speech at the London headquarters of Swiss technology firm Buhler Group, Mr Clegg said EU withdrawal would leave Britain "isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard" and not "taken seriously" by world superpowers.He has written to 100 businesses, charities and trade groups urging them to speak out about the benefits the EU brings."My great fear, in all of this, is that pro-Europeans are being too slow to wake up to the danger ahead," the Liberal Democrat leader said."The day I dread - the day I hope never comes - is a time when it is all too late: Britain has stumbled out of the EU, and we look back to these days and say we should have done more."It will not be enough to speak up on the eve of a referendum. We need to start challenging some of the ludicrous myth-making by the isolationists now."Mr Clegg said he accepted a referendum was inevitable but believed it should be held after the change to EU rules.Mr Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election.But Mr Clegg said that was designed to "plaster over" internal Tory divisions over Europe until after the 2015 general election.Mr Clegg said: "Next May the Euro elections are bound to become a proxy for the bigger questions of 'in versus out' - a debate that will play out in the 2015 general election, too."He argued that "you cannot overstate the damage" that leaving the EU would do and predict that having to negotiate individual trade treaties would take a decade."We simply will not be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers, if we're isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard," he said.On Sunday Conservative backbench MP Adam Afriyie said he would try to force the government to hold the referendum in 2014, and Mr Clegg said it was "not even clear" Mr Cameron would be able to delay the vote until 2017.He also questioned whether any reform of Britain's relationship with the EU would "ever be acceptable to the large swathes in the Conservative Party who want to be semi-detached from the EU or out of it altogether".Demonstrating another divide with his party's coalition partners, he called the European Convention on Human Rights a "huge success for European co-operation".Home Secretary Theresa May, who has clashed with Strasbourg judges over various cases including the process of deporting extremist preacher Abu Qatada, has indicated the UK could leave the convention.Business for Britain said Mr Clegg's comments risked undermining the prime minister's attempt to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.</body>

      <title>Probiotics 'soothe colicky babies'</title>
      <description>Probiotic drops soothe some babies suffering from colic, research reveals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24426623</url>
      <date>1381193976</date>
      <body>Probiotic drops soothe some babies suffering from colic, studies show.Six of 12 trials, involving nearly 2,000 babies, found it reduced crying.The Australian team who analysed the findings told the JAMA Pediatrics journal probiotics may be worth a try, particularly for breastfed babies, but larger trials were needed.There is no probiotic treatment parents can buy off the shelf. And aside from winding after a feed, there is little on offer that is proven to help.Colic affects as many as one in five babies.It is thought to be related to taking in too much air while feeding.Babies grow out of it by about four to six months, but until then colic can be distressing for all involved.Probiotics are a cocktail of live micro-organisms that, once consumed, are thought to offer certain health benefits.The 12 studies identified by Dr Valerie Sung, from the University of Melbourne, and colleagues investigated the effectiveness of probiotics given either to breastfeeding mothers or breast or bottle-fed babies.Some of the studies looked at probiotics as a treatment of colic and others for preventing colic.Three of the five "treatment" trials found probiotics helped breastfed babies, one found possible effectiveness in formula-fed babies, and one found no effect in breastfed babies.Dr Sung said: "Even though the use of a specific strain of probiotic (L reuteri) in breastfed term infants with colic is promising, there is still insufficient evidence to support the general use of probiotics in all infants with colic or to recommend its use in preventing colic."She added more trials were under way.Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives said: "Colic is not life-threatening or harmful to the baby, but it is distressing for them and their parents."We do not know what causes colic and not all crying is down to colic. The baby may be crying because they are cold or have a dirty nappy."All babies are different."Your midwife can suggest practical things that may help, such as sticking to a pattern of feeding and holding your baby and walking around to comfort it."Rosemary Dodds of the National Childbirth Trust said: "There is currently no concrete cure for baby colic, but there are ways to soothe your baby that can help greatly."For babies who are breastfed, ensuring they are well positioned at the breast, and finish the milk in the first breast before moving to the second can help."Babies who are bottle-fed can be 'winded' after a feed to help them bring up any air they take in with the milk; an upright position and gentle pressure on the stomach or patting on the back is helpful."</body>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The three new members of the shadow cabinet, Rachel Reeves, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>

      <date>1381195653</date>
      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <title>Plastic pollution 'threatens lakes'</title>
      <description>Researchers say that the problem of plastic pollution is posing a growing threat to lakes as well as oceans.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24434378</url>
      <date>1381183230</date>
      <body>Pollution with plastic waste is not confined to the oceans but poses a growing threat to lakes as well.That is the view of researchers who found significant concentrations of the substance in Italy's Lake Garda.They say the levels are similar to those found in samples taken from marine beach sediments.They are concerned that these tiny plastic particles are accumulating in freshwater species and are "likely" to get into the food chain.The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.The problem of large amounts of plastic polluting the world's oceans has been well documented in recent years.As well as bigger pieces that can choke sea creatures when ingested, there is an equally serious issue with very small fragments called micro-plastics.But research on the problems caused by plastic in lakes has been lacking.This new study looked at Lake Garda, a large, sub-alpine body of water. The researchers found significant concentrations of plastic in sediment samples. On the north shore they found around 1,000 larger particles per square metre and 450 micro-plastic particles in the same area."We were surprised," lead author Prof Christian Laforsch from the University of Bayreuth told BBC News."We have similar amounts of plastic particles in the sediment of the lake's ecosystem as we find in marine ecosystems."Chemicals found in plastics can be poisonous, can damage endocrine systems or in some cases cause cancers.They can also transport dangerous organic pollutants into clean environments like lakes.Previous research on fish and other marine creatures has shown that these species tend to accumulate tiny plastic fragments into their tissue. Prof Laforsch worries that this is happening in Lake Garda and elsewhere."What we show is that filter feeders and sediment feeders and organisms that feed on the surface layer of the lake, all swallow these plastic particles mistaking them for food."There might be impacts when it affects the hormone system, they could become sterile for example. It could also be, that when fish are feeding on these organisms they accumulate these particles also in their tissue."The problem is being caused by human use of plastic materials say the researchers.Apart from water sports, and tourist and fishing boats, the main sources of waste entering Lake Garda were discarded plastic products and debris which may originate from landfill sites.The scientists are also concerned that the discovery of significant amounts of plastic in lake environments could have implications for human populations as the waters are often used for drinking and for agriculture.And they argue that, as in the seas, plastic pollution is likely to be widespread in freshwater bodies."There is nothing particular about Lake Garda," said Prof Laforsch."We are testing in Bavaria and it looks pretty much the same. It is, I think, a problem all over Europe and maybe all over the world."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Lennox calls for pop video ratings</title>
      <description>Pop star Annie Lennox describes modern pop videos as "pornographic", and says they should be subject to a ratings system.</description>

      <date>1381165254</date>
      <body>Pop star Annie Lennox has described the sexualised imagery of modern pop videos as "dark" and "pornographic"."I'm all for freedom of expression," she told BBC Radio 5 live, "but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn.""How do you stop your kids being exposed to it? It's so powerful. You don't want to see your seven-year-old girls twerking all over the place."The singer has called for pop videos to be rated in the same way as films.She previously wrote on her Facebook page that if a pop star created "a soft porn video or highly sexualised live performance, then it needs to qualify as such and be X-rated for adults only".She told 5 live pressure from parents could help to establish "very clear boundaries" on acceptable standards in videos.Her comments fuelled a debate started by Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with singer Robin Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger.That performance, and a similarly risque video for her single Wrecking Ball, prompted Sinead O'Connor to write an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business.Artists such as Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna have also been criticised for explicit performances and costumes in the past.Lennox did not single out any one performer for criticism - referring instead to a "recent spate of overtly sexualised performances and videos" in her Facebook statement."I have nothing against these artists," she told 5 live's Anna Foster. "I was never bashing them."There's nothing wrong with sexuality and sensuality and I think these artists are beautiful. And, in many ways, what they do is fantastic, but it needs to be age-appropriate."These guys have young fan bases and they are being barraged with it."I don't think there's one parent of young boys and girls in this country that would honestly, comfortably say they were fine with seeing their kids being exposed to that kind of thing.""I think this debate is about getting the voice of reason back there to say 'look, we want to protect our kids.'"</body>

      <title>Ace cafe with quite a nice ancient monument attached?</title>
      <description>The new Stonehenge visitor centre will have a big cafe attached. But have attractions become all about the gift shop and cafe?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24335517</url>
      <date>1381130932</date>
      <body>English Heritage has announced that it is building a £27m visitor centre at Stonehenge, with what looks like a very large eating area. Is the cafe and gift shop almost as important as the attraction itself these days?Almost 50% of the shiny new visitor centre at Stonehenge will be taken up with a new "bright and spacious" cafe for up to 260 people and a bigger shop.It almost harks back to a memorable ad campaign by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1988, the museum commissioned a poster with the slogan: "Where else do they give you £100,000,000 worth of objets d'art free with every egg salad?"The poster was one of six, all describing the VandA as: "An ace caff, with quite a nice museum attached."It's a premise that won't surprise anyone who has visited a stately home or garden run by the National Trust recently. Some 19.2 million people made a trip last year. Many of those will have dutifully queued for a flapjack and a cup of tea. Or even a substantial meal.Food writer Giles Coren recalls visiting London Zoo as a child and caring more about the gift shop than the animals: "Thousands of school children, coachloads of them have to visit these places, and all they care about is the shop."He associates past visits to stately homes with rock-hard scones but thinks for many people it's increasingly all about the food. "It's like the Colosseum in Rome, people go all that way to see it only to discover it's a lot of boring old stones, but at least you can get an excellent pizza."Visitors now demand a nice place to eat, having put up with poor facilities for far too long, Coren suggests. "Everything in Britain has been rubbish for years and people won't put up with it anymore."There is scepticism among some about the new generation of visitor centres.TripAdvisor is full of reviews from people who are unimpressed. One reviewer was very upset when changes were made at a cathedral in East Anglia. "I love this cathedral, have been taking visitors to it for over 20 years… but it was so much nicer when you could walk in at the front. Now you have to go through a new visitors' centre, which adds nothing to your experience of visiting the cathedral, but does direct you past a desk for collecting your 'optional' entrance fee."Another visitor to a major modern art museum in London recalled: "We ordered their vegetable soup - a small bowl with watery soup containing some vegetables and a small hard roll (and we had to ask for some butter!) - 6.50 each! For us that's a rip-off and we were not impressed."But generally the trend is for the cafes in museums, galleries and castles to get better and better. And those in the heritage business see them as a happy synergy."A good shop and cafe greatly enhance the overall experience," says Matthew Tanner, chairman of the Association of Independent Museums. "No visit is complete without an interesting shop, a fine cup of tea, and not forgetting a good loo too."The argument for spending money on an extensive cafe is twofold - visitors have come to expect them, and the revenue raised helps subsidise the attraction.One place where this takes place is RHS Wisley in Surrey where the gift shop and cafe are the gatekeepers to the gardens people come to see. Nigel Eaton manages the shop and says it is part of the whole experience."We've got three kinds of customers - we have the RHS members who visit on a regular basis, the gardeners who come just for the plants and then we've got what we call the payers, who come on coaches for a nice day out. Every penny that is spent in the shop goes back into the RHS, so the shop is very important to us."Some 1.1 million people visit Wisley every year. The results of a customer survey revealed that 22% of those visitors came just for the "retail experience". Last year the shop - including one of the world's biggest gardening bookshops - made £3.8m and they expect to make an even bigger profit this year.As a Lonely Planet author, David Else has visited a lot of tourist attractions and has no problem with visitor centres. In fact he rather likes them."In the case of Stonehenge, a good visitor centre is going to tell you so much more about the history of what is essentially a group of old stones. I've got no problem with cafes, either - I like a good cup of tea after a visit and don't mind if they want to make a few bob to help preserve the site."In the heritage and art business it's all about making attractions "sustainable".Getting the shop and cafe right at an attraction is a win-win situation, says Jane Temperley from the Association for Cultural Enterprises. "Sure it is about generating income - everyone is looking at how to make their sites more sustainable. But research says visitors enjoy cafes and shops, happy visitors spend more and tend to become repeat visitors or members, which generates more income."About 80% of visitors to Wisley are RHS members so they come back to visit time and time again. Thirty-two staff work in the Wisley Shop and 60 staff work in the cafes and restaurants - that's over 25% of the total site staff of 350.And the staff at attraction are at pains to point out that the food has got better and better. Laurent Trenga is the chef responsible for the planning of menus at Wisley. He points out that a burger and chips at Wisley is no ordinary burger and chips. "Our burger is made from locally sourced quality pork and apples grown in our own orchards, even the bun is made fresh on site."The plants are rather nice too.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>A doctor who prescribed rest, ice, and comfortable shoes for a woman who later died of a blood clot, was medically negligent, a coroner has ruled.Jacqueline Allwood, 47, died 10 days later after a blood clot travelled from her leg to her lung.Dr Saurabh Adlakha knew of the family history of deep vein thrombosis, Southwark Coroner's Court heard.Recording a narrative verdict, medical negligence by Dr Adlakha contributed to her death, said coroner Andrew Harris.The inquest was told Dr Adlakha suggested Ms Allwood had probably suffered a sprained calf picking up Christmas decorations in December of 2012.After limping into the Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre she was told to take some ibuprofen, rest, use ice and stretch the muscle and to wear more comfortable shoes.But ten days later Ms Allwood died when a blood clot travelled to her lung."The consequences of missing a DVT are, as in this case, catastrophic," said Mr Harris.He referred Dr Adlakha to the General Medical Council for review.Outside court, Ms Allwood's daughters Tanya and Leanne Allwood said they were content with the outcome and although they did not want Dr Adlakha to be punished, they did want to believe he would learn from his mistake."We would never, never want to see another family go through what we have," Tanya Allwood said.Her mother had been "one of the most sincere, nicest people you could meet", she added.Dr Adlakha earlier told the hearing he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because "I don't want to be here again".</body>

      <title>MPs question economic case for HS2</title>
      <description>A committee of MPs concludes there are serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link will offer value for money.</description>

      <date>1381188013</date>
      <body>A committee of MPs has voiced serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link would offer the UK value for money.Members of the Treasury Committee said there were "serious shortcomings" in the current cost-benefit analysis for HS2.They said the economic case must be looked at again.A government spokesman said HS2 was vital for the UK to meet its "urgent capacity needs".HS2, which stands for High Speed Two, is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033.The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock.The Committee's report called for a more convincing case for HS2 from the Treasury."We need reassurance that it can deliver the benefits intended and that those benefits are greater than those of other transport schemes - whether in the department's project pipeline or not - which may be foregone," it said.The MPs said the government should formally reassess the project and proceed only once three criteria are met:The government spokesman said the project was on course, under control and would be delivered within the agreed budget."We are confident that our analysis is robust and conforms with government spending guidance," he said."The case for HS2 will be further improved when we publish shortly the updated strategic case - including cost-benefit analysis - which will show high value for money for the project."The HS2 plans have had the backing of all three main political leaders but are strongly opposed by some backbench MPs.However, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has hinted Labour might ditch the project over its cost if the party regains power.A recent report for HS2 Ltd found the project could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service.But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it said.</body>

      <title>'House prices up' as demand grows</title>
      <description>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers forces house prices up in Scotland, according to a survey.</description>

      <date>1381190817</date>
      <body>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers has forced house prices up in Scotland, according to a monthly survey.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found house prices increased in September.Last month, 32% more respondents reported prices rises rather than falls in the Rics survey.A net balance of 78% more surveyors also reported an increase in new-buyer inquiries.However, Rics said the lack of homes coming onto the market resulted in the number of new instructions failing to keep pace with the "burgeoning" level of demand.Looking ahead, more than half of those surveyed expected prices to continue to rise in the next three months.Responding to the latest survey, Rics director Sarah Speirs said: "It's encouraging that the market is starting to improve in all parts of the country, with more buyers looking to make a move and more sales going through."Even so, it's a big concern that the supply of property coming to the market is lagging so far behind demand, particularly with the recent launch of Help to Buy in Scotland."This imbalance is likely to result in further upward pressure in prices over the coming months, particularly in popular areas."The report comes as it was revealed that house prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the last decade.Data from the Nationwide Building Society showed that the increase is only matched by Islington and Westminster in London.The growth in the north east has been largely put down to the expanding oil and gas industry and the workers it attracts to the area.</body>

      <description>Changes to housing benefits are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, according to a senior Welsh Conservative MP.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefits are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, according to a senior Welsh Conservative MP.David Davies, on a visit to Blaenavon, Torfaen, blamed a shortage of smaller properties for people on benefits to move into compared to large cities.The reforms see housing association and council tenants having benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.Since April it has meant a 14% cut for one spare room and 25% for two.Mr Davies is chairman of the UK Parliament's Welsh Affairs Select Committee which is looking at how the changes - which critics have called the "bedroom tax" - are working in Wales.The committee is due to publish its own report on the changes shortly.Monmouth MP Mr Davies said: "These reforms are not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham where there is a larger stock of smaller properties."He was speaking as the BBC Wales Week in Week Out programme went behind the scenes with Bron Afon Housing Association, which has 509 properties in Blaenavon but only 23 one-bedroom flats.A third of the larger homes are under-occupied and affected by the benefit changes.Mr Davies met residents in the town as part of Tuesday's programme.He said ministers should be up front that some people would lose out from the UK government changes when they did not deserve to.One woman is losing £21 a week due to the changes and now faces having to leave Blaenavon where her family has lived for generations.Gail Harris has rented the same three-bedroom house for 25 years and now faces the prospect of having to leave the town if she cannot find a smaller property.She has more than £400 arrears and said the changes were "really cruel".Mr Davies told the 59-year-old he was "sorry" that she may be one of the people who could lose out."There has to be a recognition - and ministers may be reluctant to do this - when you change the law there are unforeseen and unfortunate consequences," he told her."In other words there are some people who will lose out who don't deserve to lose out - and I believe you could be one of those and I am really sorry for that."He added: "That doesn't mean we can reverse the whole thing or change it, because there is a wider issue."With limited housing stock and very limited money you can't have a situation where large numbers of people are under occupying - people living on their own in social housing with two or three bedrooms."That situation couldn't be allowed to continue."Mr Davies also provoked anger when he spoke to a young couple."You are not going to like what I have to say to you," he told 17-year-old Amy Evans and her partner Lloyd Mulry."The government have brought this in because we are in a terrible financial situation - absolutely unbelievable."And the days when we were able to fund people in your situation are gone."He told Amy he would move back home if he was in their position and that Lloyd should leave Wales for somewhere like London if he could not find work in Blaenavon.Housing officer Claire Dullea told the programme she could see why the legislation had been introduced.But she added: "If we haven't got those one bedrooms available for people to be able to move into then it's not going to happen - and those people left in the three-bedroom houses paying the bedroom tax are really, really struggling."Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales, Tuesday 8 October at 22:35 BST.</body>

      <title>200 offered MMR in measles school</title>
      <description>Two hundred pupils at a secondary school linked to four suspected cases of measles and one confirmed case are being offered the MMR vaccination.</description>

      <body>Two hundred pupils at a secondary school in Neath Port Talbot are being offered the MMR vaccination.Tuesday's special session has been organised following one confirmed case of measles and four suspected cases linked to Cwmtawe School in Pontardawe.Two pupils and a member of staff have been affected by the outbreak, said health officials.There are two other suspected cases, believed to be relatives who are pupils at another school.Public health officials said those two probable cases had been identified in children at Ysgol Y Cribarth, Abercrave, Powys.Parents of children who are not protected against measles but who are showing symptoms, including a fever, runny nose and rash, are being asked to keep their children at home.Health officials said a disappointing number of children at Cwmtawe had been vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.But at Ysgol Y Cribarth, the number of unvaccinated children is so small Powys Teaching Health Board is making arrangements for children to be immunised individually.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The Swansea area epidemic saw suspected cases first reported last November before it spread to mid and west Wales.By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic.The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.Two MMR doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.</body>

      <title>'More than 50' African billionaires</title>
      <description>Africa has 55 billionaires with a combined wealth of nearly $144bn (£89bn), far more than previously thought, a financial magazine says.</description>

      <body>Africa has 55 billionaires, far more than previously thought, Nigeria-based Ventures financial magazine says.They include three women - the mother of Kenya's president, a daughter of Angola's president and a Nigerian oil tycoon and fashion designer.The richest man is Nigeria's Aliko Dangote, with a fortune of $20.2bn (£12.5bn), Ventures said.The list is likely to reignite debate about inequality between rich and poor people in Africa, correspondents say.In April, the World Bank said the number of people living in extreme poverty in Africa had risen in the past three decades from 205 million to 414 million.A report earlier this month by research group Afrobarometer suggested that economic growth in Africa was primarily benefiting a small elite.This is the first time the respected Ventures magazine has published a list of rich Africans, reports the BBC's Tomi Oladipo reports from Nigeria's main city Lagos.The 55 billionaires it has identified are more numerous than the 16 super rich Africans listed by US financial magazine Forbes last year.It was able to identify dozens more billionaires by using "on-the-ground knowledge" to overcome hurdles that may have "hampered" other researchers, Ventures said.The magazine estimated the 55 billionaires' combined fortunes at $143.88bn, an average of a $2.6bn per person.Of the 55, 20 are Nigerian, nine are South African and eight are Egyptian, Ventures said.The richest woman is Nigeria's Folorunsho Alakija, who made her $7.3bn fortune mainly in the country's oil industry, it added.She also studied fashion in London and made dresses for Maryam Babangida, the late wife of Nigerian military ruler Ibrahim Babangida, Ventures said.Isabel Dos Santos, an Angolan investor and the eldest daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, together with Ngina Kenyatta, the mother of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, also made the cut, it added.Ventures listed Harvard-trained businessman Allan Gray as South Africa's richest man, with a fortune of $8.5bn."This media-shy South African moneyman controls two investment companies that collectively manage over $50bn in assets," Ventures said.Nathan Kirsh, a property tycoon in the tiny kingdom of Swaziland, also made it on the list.He is worth $3.6bn, and has business interests in London and New York, Ventures said.Ventures editor-in-chief Uzo Iweala told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that its estimate of 50 billionaires was probably conservative."There is this culture of you don't necessarily want to show your wealth, considering the gap between rich and poor," he said."If you have a lot of money, there are a lot of people that you have to support so we think people may be a little reluctant to be all splashy about what they have and what their assets are."</body>

      <title>Shabab fighters deploy after US raid</title>
      <description>Somali militant group al-Shabab sends extra fighters to the town of Barawe, where US commandos tried to seize one of its leaders on Saturday, residents tell the BBC.</description>

      <body>Somali militant group al-Shabab has sent reinforcements to the town of Barawe, where US commandos tried to seize one of its leaders on Saturday, residents have told the BBC.The residents say about 200 masked fighters have arrived in the coastal town with heavy machine guns.The American raid targeted a Kenyan Somali known as Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, alias Ikrima.The operation follows last month's attack on a Kenyan shopping centre.Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, has said it carried out the attack, in which at least 67 people were killed.On the same day as the raid in Somalia, US forces seized alleged al-Qaeda leader Anas al-Liby from the Libyan capital Tripoli.He is a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania.Barawe residents say Ikrima is an al-Shabab leader with responsibility for logistics, who is usually accompanied by about 20 well-armed guards.Pentagon spokesman George Little said Ikrima was closely associated with Harun Fazul and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, who helped with the 1998 embassy bombings and the 2002 attacks on a hotel and airline in Mombasa.Nabhan was killed in a 2009 US air strike in Barawe. Harun Fazul, also known as Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, was apparently killed by police in Mogadishu in 2011."While the operation did not result in Ikrima's capture, US military personnel conducted the operation with unparalleled precision," said Mr Little.He said the operation "demonstrated that the US can put direct pressure on al-Shabab leadership at any time of our choosing".According to a Kenyan intelligence report leaked to the US media, Ikrima was planning to attack targets in Kenya last year, including the Westgate shopping mall.British citizen Samantha Lewthwaite was also named as having links to the planned attacks, the report says.Early on Saturday morning the US forces approached a villa near the Indian Ocean coast where Ikrima is said to stay from time to time.As they were putting up a ladder outside the building, a guard reportedly sounded the alarm, leading to an exchange of gunfire which lasted about 20 minutes.The US forces then withdrew to the beach, got into speedboats and returned to a waiting ship, said residents of the town, which is 180km (110 miles) south of the capital Mogadishu.Al-Shabab has said that one of its fighters was killed during the attack.The BBC's Mohammed Moalimu in Mogadishu says that residents are now afraid to use their phones in case they are accused of being US spies.Al-Shabab has controlled the town since 2008.When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: "Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret."US Secretary of State John Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".The US has a huge military base in neighbouring Djibouti, from where it carries out many of its operations in Somalia.Al-Shabab has been forced out of most of Somalia's major cities in the past two years but it still controls many rural parts of southern and central Somalia.In 2008, al-Shabab commander Aden Hashi Ayro was assassinated in a US air strike in central Somalia.Last year, US Navy Seals parachuted from a plane into central Somalia to free US aid worker Jessica Buchanan and her Danish colleague Poul Thisted.US officials said at the time the two were held by criminals, not Islamists.</body>

      <title>Karzai: Nato has caused suffering</title>
      <description>Afghan President Hamid Karzai tells BBC Newsnight that Nato has inflicted great suffering on the Afghan people, with insufficient gains.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24433433</url>
      <date>1381164852</date>
      <body>President Hamid Karzai has criticised Nato for failing to bring stability to Afghanistan in over a decade there."On the security front the entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure," he said.He said Nato had incorrectly focused the fight on Afghan villages rather than Taliban safe havens in Pakistan.Mr Karzai has just six months remaining in office until a successor is elected."I am not happy to say that there is partial security. That's not what we are seeking. What we wanted was absolute security and a clear-cut war against terrorism," Mr Karzai said of the Nato campaign.Speaking in one of his last major interviews before stepping down, he told BBC Newsnight that his priority now is to bring peace and security to Afghanistan, including a power-sharing deal with the Taliban.He said that his government was actively engaged in talks with the hardline Islamic group with this aim in mind:"They are Afghans. Where the Afghan president, the Afghan government can appoint the Taliban to a government job they are welcome," he said. "But where it's the Afghan people appointing people through elections to state organs then the Taliban should come and participate in elections."He dismissed concerns that bringing the Taliban back into government would sacrifice the tenuous gains on the status of women made in Afghanistan."The return of the Taliban will not undermine progress. This country needs to have peace. I am willing to stand for anything that will bring peace to Afghanistan and through that to promote the cause of the Afghan women better," he said."I have no doubt that there will be more Afghan young girls and women studying and getting higher education and better job opportunities. There is no doubt about that; even if the Taliban come that will not end, that will not slow down," he added.Before the elections for Mr Karzai's successor the United States is keen to finalise a bilateral security agreement which will also formalise US-Afghan relations following the 2014 Nato troop withdrawal.The US wants this signed by Mr Karzai, to avoid it becoming an election issue. However, the Afghan leader told Newsnight he was in no hurry to sign a pact:"If the agreement doesn't suit us then of course they can leave. The agreement has to suit Afghanistan's interests and purposes. If it doesn't suit us and if it doesn't suit them then naturally we will go separate ways."The US is becoming more and more pessimistic about the issue and has said it will consider a zero troops option.Mr Karzai has had troubled relations with his Western backers in recent years for openly criticising Nato, whom he has accused of having no respect for Afghan sovereignty.In 2009, US President Barack Obama described Mr Karzai as an unreliable and ineffective partner. However, speaking to Newsnight Mr Karzai dismissed the claim saying he was characterised in this manner "because where they want us to go along, we don't go along. They want us to keep silent when civilians are killed. We will not, we cannot".He said that in the years immediately following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan he had had good relations with the-then President George W Bush as in "those beginning years there was not much difference of opinion between us"."The worsening of relations began in 2005 where we saw the first incidents of civilian casualties, where we saw that the war on terror was not conducted where it should have been."Mr Karzai said the war should have been conducted "in the sanctuaries, in the training grounds beyond Afghanistan, rather than that which the US and Nato forces were conducting operations in Afghan villages, causing harm to Afghan people."There has also been much criticism of the Afghan government's failure to deal with corruption, which along with lack of progress on significantly improving women's rights, saw Norway cutting some its aid to the country last week."Our government is weak and ineffective in comparison to other governments, we've just begun," Mr Karzai said. "But the big corruption, the hundreds of millions of dollars of corruption, it was not Afghan. Now everybody knows that. It was foreign."The contracts, the subcontracts, the blind contracts given to people, money thrown around to buy loyalties, money thrown around to buy submissiveness of Afghan government officials, to policies and designs that the Afghans would not agree to. That was the major part of corruption," he said.</body>

      <title>Australia PM Abbott in expenses row</title>
      <description>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is embroiled in a row over expenses claims, less than a month after taking office.</description>

      <body>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has become embroiled in a row over expenses claims, less than a month after taking office.Last week Mr Abbott paid back funds claimed to attend the weddings of two colleagues.On Tuesday he defended claims relating to two sporting events, saying both represented community engagement work.Tony Abbott, who heads a conservative coalition, ousted Kevin Rudd as prime minister in the 7 September election.Speaking at the Apec summit on the Indonesian island of Bali, Mr Abbott, an avid sportsman, said claims related to a triathlon event in which he competed in the town of Port Macquarie in 2011 were justified.''Let's not forget that Port Macquarie was a marginal seat effectively and I want to assure you that I don't go to marginal seats simply for sporting events, although the sporting event in question was a community event,'' he said.''I think you'll find there were quite a few other community events involved in those visits.''He also defended claims related to a multi-day charity cycling event known as Pollie Pedal, saying the trip took him ''to towns, communities, sometimes hamlets that rarely see a politician''.''It is a perfectly legitimate thing for a member of parliament to do," he said.Last week, Mr Abbott repaid a total of A$1,700 ($1,600, £995) claimed to attend the weddings of two former political allies in 2006.He said he checked his claims after two of his frontbenchers came under fire for expenses related to the wedding of a radio host. Both lawmakers have since repaid the funds.The opposition Labor party has called for the system to be tightened up."I don't think most MPs - the vast, vast, vast majority - are out to do anything wrong," Bill Shorten, who together with Anthony Albanese is contesting the Labor party leadership, told ABC radio."If there is this confusion and there is this uncertainty, then it does need to be cleaned up for the public confidence in the system," he added.Labor frontbencher Mark Dreyfus called for a "serious investigation", describing a "pattern of behaviour by Coalition MPs".However, later on Tuesday, it emerged that he would also return more than $400 ($370; £234) in incorrect expenses.He had claimed for accommodation for a weekend in Canberra, between two weeks when parliament was sitting, in August 2011.However, he was in fact skiing at Perisher Valley that weekend. The claim was an "an administrative error", his office said in a statement."Mr Dreyfus is sorry for the mistake and is repaying the $466," the statement added.</body>

      <title>Euro MPs vote on anti-tobacco rules</title>
      <description>The European Parliament is to vote on tougher tobacco regulations especially aimed at preventing younger people from taking up smoking.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381219629</date>
      <body>Euro MPs will vote shortly on new measures aimed at putting young people off smoking, including bigger health warnings on cigarette packets and restrictions on electronic cigarettes.Under the draft legislation from the European Commission e-cigarettes would become a medicinal product.Menthol cigarettes could be banned, along with other flavoured tobacco.Packs of 10 as well as slim cigarettes - marketed mainly to women - would no longer be sold.Smaller packs are reckoned to be more attractive to young smokers.It is the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on chewing tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.Once agreed, all 28 EU countries will have to make the measures law.After Tuesday's vote there will be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives and should not be restricted because they could dramatically reduce smoking-related diseases.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking."Tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products," said EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg, presenting the proposals.The current requirement for health warnings on packets is 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.The new packaging requirements would also apply to roll-your-own tobacco.The legislation would allow member states the option of plain, non-branded packaging "in duly justified cases".The Commission says packets must be big enough to ensure full visibility for the health warnings, so the recommendation is at least 20 cigarettes per pack.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. It is argued that bigger, more expensive packets are less attractive to young smokers.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The associated costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <title>Sarkozy secret cash case 'dropped'</title>
      <description>A criminal investigation into French former President Nicolas Sarkozy over alleged secret campaign financing in the "Bettencourt affair" is dropped, judicial sources say.</description>

      <date>1381157093</date>
      <body>A criminal investigation into former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, for allegedly soliciting secret campaign financing from France's richest woman, has been dropped, judicial sources say.Mr Sarkozy has been left off a list of those to appear for trial over the so-called Bettencourt affair, they say.He had denied visiting L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt - alleged to be mentally frail - to solicit cash.The decision could leave Mr Sarkozy, 58, clear to contest the 2017 election.Although unpopular when he lost his attempt to be re-elected in 2012, opinion polls now suggest he would beat President Francois Hollande in a re-run.He has hinted at a comeback, saying earlier this year that he might have to return to "save" France from economic disaster under President Hollande.The possibility of a criminal case against him has, therefore, gripped the media in France.Mrs Bettencourt's accountant, Claire Thibout, has said she withdrew 150,000 euros (£125,000) in cash that was to be passed to Mr Sarkozy's conservative UMP party in the run-up to his presidential election victory in 2007.Individual campaign contributions in France are limited to 4,600 euros annually.Mrs Bettencourt's butler testified that Mr Sarkozy was a regular visitor to her home during his 2007 campaign.But Mr Sarkozy insisted that he only saw Mrs Bettencourt once in that year.The argument came to a dramatic head in March, when a judge summoned both Mr Sarkozy and the butler for a face-to-face encounter, after which preliminary charges were filed against the former president.He was charged with taking advantage of Mrs Bettencourt, by accepting cash from her when she was too frail to know what she was doing.Mrs Bettencourt, now 90, has suffered from dementia since 2006, the AFP news agency reports.Ten people are still facing trial over the case, Le Monde reports.They include Mr Sarkozy's former campaign aide and UMP treasurer - and later, the French budget minister - Eric Woerth, Le Monde says.Bettencourt staff say Mr Woerth visited the house several times to pick up envelopes stuffed full of cash. He denies doing so.It had never been alleged that Mr Sarkozy personally received money.He still faces investigation in other cases - including another related to his 2007 presidential run, in which it is alleged that he received funding from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi - which he strongly denies.</body>

      <body>Protesters demonstrating in support of teachers receiving better pay in the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have clashed with police.The centre of Rio was packed with more than 10,000 people marching peacefully.But as it got dark, some protesters threw firebombs at public buildings and riot police responded with tear gas.A similar protest in Sao Paulo also ended in violent confrontation with police after many banks were ransacked by hooded protesters.Brazil's security situation is a challenge to cities that will play host to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games.The latest demonstration took place over several hours and was peaceful at first.But once night fell, violent incidents broke out as at least 20 "black bloc" anarchists smashed a City Hall gate while others broke into banks and tried to break break into ATMs. Some banks were set alight.Demonstrators also torched a bus on busy Rio Branco Avenue, and took furniture out of banks to use in barricades as the stand-off off with police continued.Authorities used tear gas to restore order."Without the police, there is no violence. When they are there, there always is," said anarchist Hugo Cryois, 23, who had a gas mask dangling from his neck."I came prepared," he said. "You can't trust them."Teachers have been demanding a pay increase for two months. About 50,000 people were estimated to have marched to support them before the violence broke out, but police would only confirm the 10,000 estimate.</body>

      <title>Argentine president to have surgery</title>
      <description>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will undergo surgery on Tuesday to treat bleeding on her brain, doctors say.</description>

      <body>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will undergo surgery on Tuesday to treat bleeding on her brain, doctors have said.Ms Fernandez, 60, was earlier ordered to rest for a month after doctors discovered the subdural haematoma.It was diagnosed as she was undergoing tests for another condition on Saturday.This means Ms Fernandez will have to suspend campaigning for congressional elections.The break from campaigning is considered awkward for the president as some opinion polls have suggested the government could lose control of Congress in the poll on 27 October.While her party has done well in the primaries on a nationwide level it has failed to win a key seat in the province of Buenos Aires, where her rival and former cabinet chief Sergio Massa beat Ms Fernandez's candidate.Medical experts say recovering from this type of surgery is a long process, and her lay-off is now likely to be longer than a month.It has not yet been officially announced whether Vice-President Amado Boudou, who is facing a corruption investigation, will be in charge of the country during her leave.The president's spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, issued a statement on Sunday saying her doctors had carried out a brain scan in August after a previously undisclosed trauma - thought to have been caused by a fall.They found nothing untoward, but on Saturday, she went to hospital for checks for an irregular heartbeat and headaches, and a further scan revealed the subdural haematoma - bleeding between the brain and the skull.The hospital treating her said on Monday she had experienced a slight loss of muscular strength in her left arm, and recommended surgery to drain the subdural hematoma.President Fernandez was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.Her health has been followed closely since the sudden death of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, from a heart attack in 2010.She has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions while serving as president. She has low blood pressure and had to have a thyroid gland removed in 2012.</body>

      <body>At least nine Egyptian soldiers and police officers have been killed in two attacks in different regions.Officials said a car bomb killed three police officers in southern Sinai, hours after masked gunmen shot dead six soldiers in a patrol car outside the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya.Rockets also hit a government-run satellite station in Cairo. No group has said it carried out the attacks.Dozens died on Sunday in clashes between Islamists and security forces.Thousands of supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi fought with security forces in Cairo, in the most intense violence for several weeks.Cairo itself has returned to calm, although the Islamists have urged their supporters to continue their protests.In Monday's string of attacks:Police in Qaliubiya, north of Cairo, arrested 38 members of the Muslim Brotherhood carrying petrol bombs, firecrackers and masks as they stormed a metro station, reported Mena state news agency.The Brotherhood members "opened fire on police troops and residents and destroyed entrance and exit gates of the station", it said.Security forces have been the frequent victims of attacks in northern Sinai, where analysts say a fully fledged insurgency is building.But the south of the peninsula, which is a centre of tourism, had remained largely peaceful until the attack in al-Tour on Monday.The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Cairo says Sinai is a magnet for militants, and weapons have been shipped there from Libya.The Egyptian military is in the middle of its biggest operation in Sinai for many years, he adds.Monday's attacks will raise further fears of a confrontation between Islamists and the army, correspondents say.</body>

      <title>Israelis mourn Rabbi Ovadia Yosef</title>
      <description>Vast crowds attend the Jerusalem funeral of influential rabbi and founder of the Shas party Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who died aged 93.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24429733</url>
      <date>1381177997</date>
      <body>Several hundred thousand people have attended the funeral in Jerusalem of influential Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.The rabbi, who was the leader of the Sephardic Jewish community, died earlier on Monday at the age of 93.Orthodox Jews wearing black clothing congregated outside the seminary where he studied. Israeli police said more than 700,000 people were participating in the funeral.An ambulance service spokesperson said 40 people had received minor injuries.Crowds of people surrounded the van carrying Rabbi Yosef's body. Streets have been closed off and thousands of additional police deployed."We estimate there are more the 700,000 people taking part in the largest of funerals ever in Israel," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said on Twitter.The rabbi was a leading Torah scholar and arbiter of Halacha, or Jewish law.He was also the spiritual leader of the Shas party, which he founded in 1984 to boost representation for Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin.Until then, Israel's government and religious institutions had tended to be dominated by Ashkenazi Jews - those of European descent.Though it is currently in opposition, Shas became a kingmaker in several coalition governments.Shas leader Arye Deri wept uncontrollably following the announcement of the rabbi's death."How will we remain alone? Who will lead us?" he asked, referring to the rabbi as "our father".Israel's President Shimon Peres had visited the rabbi in hospital as his condition deteriorated on Monday.The president and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were both present for the funeral, which took place on the day of the rabbi's death in accordance with Jewish custom.Mr Netanyahu had expressed "deep sorrow" at the news of Rabbi Yosef's death, describing him as "among the greatest rabbis of our generation"."Rabbi Ovadia was a giant in Torah and Jewish law and a teacher for tens of thousands," he said in a statement."The Jewish People have lost one of the wisest men of this generation."The Iraqi-born cleric was also known for his controversial comments about Arabs, secular Jews, liberals, women and gay people.He once likened Palestinians to snakes, and in 2010 called for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to "vanish from our world".However, he also encouraged Israeli politicians to engage in the peace process with the Palestinians and by abstaining, helped secure the passage of the first Oslo peace accord through the Knesset.President Abbas, meeting visiting Israeli MPs in Ramallah on Monday, asked them to send his condolences to Rabbi Yosef's family.The rabbi's son, Yitzhak Yosef, is the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel.</body>

      <title>Kerry defends US Libya capture</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry defends the US seizure of a suspected al-Qaeda leader in Libya, who he said was a "legal and appropriate target".</description>

      <date>1381178024</date>
      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the capture of an alleged al-Qaeda leader, Anas al-Liby, calling him a "legal and appropriate target".He is a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Africa.His son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father was seized by masked gunmen and that some of them were Libyans.Mr Kerry's comments come after Libya called on the US to explain the raid on its territory, one of two by US commandos in Africa on Saturday.Mr Kerry said Anas al-Liby, who has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head, would face justice in a court of law."With respect to Abu Anas al-Liby, he is a key al-Qaeda figure, and he is a legal and an appropriate target for the US military," Mr Kerry told reporters on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Indonesia.Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification on the raid and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya"."The Libyan government has been following the reports of the kidnap of one of the Libyan citizens wanted by the authorities in the United States," said a Libyan government statement issued on Sunday."As soon as it heard the reports, the Libyan government contacted the US authorities to demand an explanation."Citing surveillance camera footage, Mr Liby's son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday by masked gunmen armed with pistols, as he was parking outside his house.He said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect.He claims the Libyan government was implicated in his father's disappearance - a claim Tripoli denies.Mr Liby's brother, Nabih, on Sunday told reporters his brother was innocent, describing the US operation as an "act of piracy".Anas al-Liby - real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.The 49-year-old has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks.On Saturday, US commandos also carried out a raid in southern Somalia, but failed to capture their target.Pentagon spokesman George Little confirmed on Monday that they were chasing Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, a Kenyan al-Shabab commander also known as Ikrima.He is alleged to have been involved in plotting a number of attacks in Kenya.Al-Shabab has said it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: "Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret."Mr Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".</body>

      <title>US Supreme Court tackles busy agenda</title>
      <description>The US Supreme Court begins its new term this week with an agenda tackling social issues ranging from campaign finance to affirmative action.</description>

      <body>The US Supreme Court begins its new term this week with an agenda full of high-profile cases on social issues ranging from reproductive rights to affirmative action.On Tuesday, the court will hear a campaign finance follow-on to its controversial 2010 Citizens United decision.That 5-4 ruling allowed corporations to offer unlimited funds in support of or opposition to political candidates.The court term will end in June 2014.The court's first major case - McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission - is a challenge to the overall limits an individual can give to political action committees, candidates and parties in a two-year federal election cycle.The court has scrutinised several campaign finance laws in recent years, including Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, which freed corporations and labour unions to make unlimited contributions in candidate elections.Other high-profile cases on the court's agenda this term include National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning, which will test US President Barack Obama's ability to bypass the Senate in making recess appointments.Two abortion cases are also scheduled to be argued before the court this term, one of which challenges a Massachusetts state law restricting protests near reproductive health facilities.Later this month, the court will also hear arguments in Schuette v Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, which challenges whether the state of Michigan can ban affirmative action in higher education."This term, like the past couple of terms, what we have is the court taking [on] a broad range of highly salient social issues," Goldstein and Russell counsel Tejinder Singh told the BBC."There's no clear trend yet in terms of what issues interest the court, but what is clear is the court is not being shy about loading its docket with high-profile cases with potentially substantial ramifications."</body>

Will she face more dangers, or fight the same battles?More than 100 years since women began winning the right to vote, many societies are still dominated by men.Millions of teenage girls worldwide do not finish school, beginning their childbearing years as their counterparts in the West are beginning to dream of careers and qualifications.Yet the world is a better place for women than ever before. Maternal health is improving, as is access to education.

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24438875</url>
      <date>1381180644</date>
      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>Is the British weather unique in the world?</title>
      <description>The five air masses that control how much it rains in UK</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24305230</url>
      <date>1381198849</date>
      <body>It's often said by laymen that the UK's weather is unique. But what makes it so different from anywhere else?Whatever you think of the British weather, if you don't like it one day there's always a good chance you might like it the next.Weather, in meteorological terms, refers to the daily elements like temperature, wind and rain. And in Britain they can all change hour by hour and day by day.It's this diversity and changeability that makes British weather so distinct, say meteorologists. While temperatures are fairly mild and there are four distinct seasons, you can also get warm weather in the middle of February and freezing rain in the middle of August - or both in one day."Other countries might have more dramatic weather," says Dr Liz Bentley, head of the Weather Club at the Royal Meteorological Society. "In India and Pakistan you get monsoon season, but you can usually predict the day it will start and the day it will finish."In the UK you sometimes have to look at the weather forecast several times in one morning just to plan a trip out that afternoon. Things can change that quickly."Many meteorologists call the British weather unique, although some say you could argue the weather in all countries is unique because no two are the same geographically and geologically. But they agree it is hard to find another country in the world with weather that compares to the UK.So what makes it so distinctly variable?"Britain's unique weather is all down to the fact it is an island and where it's positioned on the planet, between the Atlantic Ocean and a large land mass, continental Europe," says Helen Chivers from the Met Office. "There is a lot going on meteorologically where we are."Britain is under an area where five main air masses meet. An air mass is a large body of air that has similar temperature and moisture properties throughout.In the UK they are either polar or tropical, depending on where the air mass originated; they are also divided into maritime or continental, depending on whether the air has passed over land or sea.They come from all directions and can bring all types of weather.When they meet it creates a weather front. The air masses fight it out and the one that wins dictates the weather. There is a sixth air mass, the returning Polar Maritime, which is a variation of the Polar Maritime.One more important thing to throw into the mix is the jet stream. It is a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air that drives all weather in the UK's latitude around the northern hemisphere. It is responsible for developing weather systems.All in all, it's quite a mix of atmospheric conditions battling it out."It's what makes the British weather so fascinating," says Bentley. "Experiencing such big changes so quickly is unique."Fascinating or frustrating, the layman might argue, but no other country in the world gets the same weather, say experts."Japan is probably the only other place that has similarities to the UK when it comes to weather," says Chivers."It is similar to us but in reverse. It is an island and has the Pacific Ocean to the east and Eurasian continent to the west. Britain's variations in weather really are that rare."These variations pose problems, from when to have a barbecue to effective planning for businesses. Companies spend millions trying not to be caught out by the British weather."From energy companies, supermarkets and insurance firms to banks, technology companies and local authorities, they all need to plan for the weather," says Richard Tipper, director of Ecometrica, which works with companies to get the climate and weather data they need to plan efficiently."It's the amazing changeability in British weather that is unique. It also means planning for it isn't always easy."Subtle changes in the weather are happening and will continue, says Bentley."We are starting to see more record-breaking weather, record droughts and record rainfall," she says.Last year is a good example. The dramatic switch from drought in early 2012 to the wettest April to June on record was of a magnitude never seen before, according to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).Hosepipe bans were brought in early in the year but by early autumn levels of groundwater were "well above" average.But the country's fascination with the weather probably won't change. Nor will some people's love for it."There is a real beauty about the weather in the UK," says Bentley."You might be guaranteed sun in other countries but constant sunshine can get dull. People move to other countries but often they end up missing the British weather and the seasons."There are also some real upsides. When we get unexpected sunshine in the UK everyone's day is better. It just feels like we are getting a special treat and we are so much happier."The Great British Year is on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 9 October or catch up with iPlayer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>'Do I still not like that': Graham Taylor's lowest point</title>
      <description>Graham Taylor recalls low point of his spell as England manager</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24354888</url>
      <date>1381186810</date>
      <body>"If you say 'Holland' to me, to this day I see David Platt running through on goal. I can't help it. When things don't go well as an England manager, it sticks with you for the rest of your life."Wednesday, 13 October, 1993 is a date lodged firmly in the mind of former England manager Graham Taylor.Three years into the job, three years after Bobby Robson, Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker had captured the nation's hearts by reaching the semi-finals of Italia 90, the unthinkable happened.A controversial defeat by the Netherlands in Rotterdam, with Ronald Koeman scoring the opener minutes after he should have been dismissed for a professional foul, effectively ended England's chances of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.Taylor was left feeling "cheated".Thanks to a warts-and-all documentary broadcast on Channel 4 a year later, images of Taylor's touchline fury and exasperation remain etched in England fans' collective memory.After a poor Euro 92 which saw England eliminated in the group stages after scoring just once in three games, Taylor's maiden World Cup campaign got off to a bad start.Leads at home to Norway and then the Netherlands were painfully squandered, putting qualification in doubt."We played very well in both of those games and if we had won just one, which we deserved to, we would have been OK," Taylor remembers.But the away double-header in May and June of 1993 did not go well either.A draw in Poland and defeat away against leaders Norway in the space of four days left Taylor's side up against it. However, after an impressive 3-0 win over Poland at Wembley, England's fate was in their own hands going into the penultimate fixture in Rotterdam."We were a point above the Netherlands, with two games to go," says Taylor. "A draw would have been enough for us to qualify and we were as confident as we could expect to be."With captain Stuart Pearce injured and Lazio midfielder Paul Gascoigne suspended, Taylor made five changes to his side.Off the pitch, he was called on to help smuggle in the documentary crew after they were denied access by the Dutch FA. The crew donned England tracksuits and carried their film equipment into the stadium in team kitbags.Once the match kicked off, Leeds full-back Tony Dorigo - standing in for Pearce - smashed a long-range free-kick against the post, while Frank Rijkaard had an effort for the hosts disallowed in a goalless first half.So far, so good.The match, England's hopes and Taylor's career were all transformed by a two-minute spell around the hour mark. Andy Sinton - on at half-time in place of Carlton Palmer - hit a long ball over the top for David Platt to run on to.The England skipper was hauled to the ground by Koeman, but referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher decided to only show the Barcelona man a yellow card, rather than red.The documentary was to show Taylor imploring the German official to send Koeman off, memorably asking fourth official Markus Merk: "What sort of thing is happening here?"Even 20 years on, Taylor is incensed by the decision."I could not believe what I was seeing. It was a goalscoring opportunity and Koeman should have gone," he says. "Fifa had made a very strong point in the weeks before the game that the denial of a goalscoring opportunity was a straight red card."He should have been sent off, absolutely."After the game, Koeman admitted he had expected to be dismissed. Instead, Dorigo's free-kick was blocked by the advancing Dutch wall and two minutes later the home side were given a free-kick at the other end.To heighten England's sense of injustice, it was Koeman who stepped up to score. His first effort was charged down by Ince, but he made no mistake second time around, with ITV commentator Brian Moore's prophecy of "he's going to flick one, he's going to flick one" proving accurate as he curled the ball into the top corner."That was when I lost it," Taylor says. "I honestly felt that we were being cheated. The referee was favouring the home side, I really felt that, as the free-kick we had blocked was exactly the same."The only other occasion in my career I felt like that was when I was in charge of Lincoln and we had a terrible penalty awarded at Birmingham. But this was obviously worse."I lost the plot because I honestly and truthfully felt that England were being cheated in a vital game for the country."That was the worst I've ever been on a touchline. I'd never been like that before. But that is the one time I end up on film, so that's what people remember."Paul Merson hit the post again but a second goal for the Netherlands followed, with Dennis Bergkamp scoring."The referee's got me the sack," Taylor told the linesman in the closing minutes. "Thank him ever so much for that won't you?"Taylor concluded his reign with a futile 7-1 win in San Marino in November 1993, as the Netherlands secured qualification by beating Poland. Taylor resigned six days later."I try not to think about what would have happened next if Koeman had been sent off," Taylor says. "I'm sure we would have qualified for the World Cup and I probably keep my job. But that's life."Film-maker Ken McGill and his team had been recording Taylor and his team throughout the qualifiers. Taylor had agreed to take part in the programme as he hoped it would show the differences between club and international management.But as results turned for the worse, the focus shifted to Taylor himself - the man in the 'Impossible Job', the title of the film which more than six million people tuned in to watch."I didn't ever expect that we wouldn't qualify, I was arrogant enough to think that," admits Taylor."So I was keen to show the problems of being England manager. Then, as the results went on and we didn't qualify, I became more central to the documentary, quite rightly."You're the country's number one villain."Taylor thought about cancelling filming before the trip to Norway in June 1993, but knew that the written press - who were already hostile towards him - would seize on it as an admission England would not qualify."One positive which came out of it is that people saw I was passionate about the job," Taylor says. "But I can't watch it. I put a little bit of the documentary on my computer recently but I couldn't watch it."I said to myself 'don't watch it Graham, because for the next week you'll be down'."In the aftermath of his resignation - and being labelled a 'turnip' by the Sun newspaper in 1992 - Taylor considered leaving the country. Instead he stayed and rebuilt his club career, taking Watford back to the top flight.The documentary was a hit. But McGill, who has also made films with Gascoigne, Lennox Lewis and Ian Botham,  has mixed feelings 20 years on.Taylor may have been able to return to work, but his assistant Phil Neal was criticised for being 'a yes man' after the documentary was broadcast. At the time, he was England's most decorated player, yet his managerial career never recovered, with a brief spell in charge of Manchester City in 1996 his last job as a coach."At the time I felt terrible," McGill admits, "not only for Graham but I also feel responsible for Phil not being able to earn a living in football any more."If it wasn't for Graham's help, we would not have been able to film in Rotterdam. We would have missed all of that drama."I found it hard to take the consequences of the film. But there is nothing I would change. It is a piece of honest film-making."</body>

      <title>How Danish Jews escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>The moment that nearly every Jew in Denmark decided to vanish</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24427637</url>
      <date>1381191229</date>
      <body>Seventy years ago this month, an extraordinary mass escape happened from Nazi-occupied Denmark. Tipped off about German plans to deport them to concentration camps, almost the entire Jewish population - several thousand people - fled their homes and left the country.As he stepped onto the fishing boat that was meant to carry them across the Baltic sea to safety, 14-year-old Bent Melchior feared he might never see his home again.A week earlier, he had left the home in Copenhagen he shared with his parents and four siblings. It was 8 October 1943 and Denmark was under Nazi occupation. Along with thousands of other Danish Jews, Bent and his family were fleeing the Germans."We were gathered in this boat that was supposed to carry herrings, but instead it was now carrying human beings," he says.They set off after dark. There were 19 people on the boat, hiding below deck in case German planes should spot them from overhead. The night air was chilly and the sea rough."People started to be sick, and every minute felt like an hour".Melchior and his family were part of a mass escape. That autumn night, 2,500 Jews set sail for neighbouring Sweden from Danish beaches and ports, in rowing boats, canoes, as stowaways on ferries and cargo ships. Some even swam across.In September that year, the Nazi secret police - the Gestapo - had decided to deport all Danish Jews to concentration camps, just as they'd done to millions of other Jews across Europe. The raid was scheduled for Friday 1 October, when they had hoped to find families gathering for the Jewish Sabbath dinner.But when they raided their homes, they found less than 300 people still there.A few days earlier, Georg Duckwitz, a German naval attache working at the German embassy in Copenhagen, had tipped off Hans Hedtoft, a leading member of the Danish Labour party. Hedtoft, who later became Denmark's prime minister, warned the Jewish community to leave."My parents were worried the phone might be tapped. So my mum started ringing other Jewish families, encouraging them to 'take a holiday in the countryside'," Melchior recalls."She told them we were also going away for a few days as we hadn't had a holiday that year."In 1943, Denmark was home to around 8,000 Jews. Although the country had been invaded by Germany three years earlier, the government had accepted the occupation in exchange for a measure of control over domestic affairs. Danish Jews were protected by the Danish government, whose leader collaborated with Hitler.But a determined campaign by the Danish resistance prompted Germany to take over full control of Danish affairs and the government resigned in August. The following month, Hitler ordered the deportation of all Danish Jews.As news of the imminent Nazi raid spread, Melchior's father, a rabbi at Copenhagen's main synagogue, interrupted a service celebrating Jewish New Year to urge the congregation to go into hiding and to spread the word to other Jews.The Melchior family caught a train to the island of Falster in south-eastern Denmark. The carriages were filled with German soldiers and Bent's mother and five-year-old brother Paul travelled in an empty first-class carriage in case the youngest family member unwittingly gave away where they were going.Together with 60 other Jewish refugees, Bent Melchior's father brought his wife and four youngest children into hiding at the home of a bishop. From there, they hoped to flee across the sea to neutral Sweden, which offered safety for refugees.But getting there was not easy. To even secure a place on one of the small fishing boats being used to ferry the Jews across could cost as much as £5,500 ($9,000) a head in today's money.After eight hours at sea, the boat carrying the Melchior family came close to land. Dawn was breaking and a lighthouse was clearly visible. But something was wrong. Having learnt in geography at school that Sweden was east of Denmark, Bent realised that daylight was coming from the wrong direction.In fact, the boat had sailed in a circle rather than east to the Swedish coast. The lighthouse was a Danish lighthouse and the refugees were back where they had set off. The fisherman at the helm had never sailed far from the coast and had no idea how to navigate.Sitting in the comfortable apartment in central Copenhagen he shares with his wife Lilian, surrounded by pictures of their four sons, his recollection of the escape he made 70 years ago is still crystal clear."We were afraid. My five-year-old brother had no idea what was going on. Unbeknownst to me my mother was pregnant at the time, so she had a terrible time," says Bent Melchior."If it was dangerous to be out at sea it night, it was even more dangerous in daylight. We could hear German planes overhead. If they had seen us, the Gestapo would have captured us."Eventually they started to sail east, following the sun. Miraculously, after 18 hours at sea, they reached Lilla Beddinge, a small fishing village on the Swedish coast. A six-year-old boy, Per-Arne Persson, spotted them from the beach and alerted his father, a local fisherman, who sailed out to meet the boat.Bent Melchior and his family settled down to their new life in Sweden. Bent was enrolled in a Danish school in the town of Lund, while his father got a job as a rabbi. But they were now refugees in a foreign country.Swedish was not hard for Danes to understand and the Swedish government had assured them they could stay for the duration of the war. Nevertheless, strangers would often make comments about them."People would complain that we were taking their coffee rations, or whatever was rationed at the time."As refugees we had to queue up to buy second-hand underwear, which they had decided was good enough for us."Seven decades later, Bent can still recall what it was like to be an alien abroad: "All these denigrating signs, I can still feel today," he says.Around 200 people were caught by the Germans while trying to escape and deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic. But more than 7,500 Danish Jews eventually made it across to Sweden in October 1943.They were brought out under cover. Some escape routes were organised by members of the resistance movement. But most Danish historians argue that the escape would not have been possible had it not been for thousands of ordinary Danes who helped the Jews flee.Some were "admitted" to hospitals under false names, others were hidden in churches, farms and holiday homes by the sea while they organised transport.There were of course, exceptions. Eighty Jewish refugees hiding in the loft of a church in the northern town of Gilleleje were arrested by the Gestapo after a young Danish housemaid, engaged to a German soldier, turned them in. They too, were deported to Theresienstadt.After 19 months in Sweden, the German occupation of Denmark was over. Liberation came on 4 May, 1945 and the refugees were free to return home. Melchior and his family moved back into their old apartment in Copenhagen.Life fell back into its usual rhythm, but it was never the same. His experience as a refugee galvanised Bent Melchior to a life-long involvement with refugees."We were changed people. I became very active in various movements within the Jewish community and outside."We tried to take a lesson from what had happened, to stop this terrible intolerance."He later went on to become a senior member of the Danish Refugee Council and followed his father in becoming the chief rabbi of Denmark.He has travelled the world telling his story, determined that this tale of survival should never be forgotten.Per-Arne, the six-year old Swedish boy who spotted their boat from the beach 70 years ago, is still a friend today.Bent Melchior's interview with the BBC World Service programme Witness will be broadcast at 07:50GMT on 8 October.

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24369363</url>
      <date>1381193972</date>
      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <description>Papers react to party leaders' reshuffles</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24440153</url>
      <date>1381208246</date>
      <body>The papers have plenty to say about reshuffles carried out by all three main political party leaders.The Guardian reports that Home Secretary Theresa May was said to be "spitting tacks" after Nick Clegg imposed Liberal Democrat Norman Baker on her department.The paper says Mrs May was not consulted about his appointment.For his part, Mr Baker tells the Independent he wants to make the Home Office "more liberal" and ensure "the rights of individuals are protected".The Daily Telegraph says there was a "far greater significance to yesterday's manoeuvrings" than is usually the case, particularly in the Labour camp.The paper's editorial maintains that Ed Miliband's purge of remaining Blairites, coupled with the demotion of more centrist colleagues, provides further evidence that Labour is now "an out-and-out party of the left".According to The Daily Express, the Labour leader has shown his "deepest red" colours by penalising those urging moderation.On the other hand, the paper insists David Cameron has taken on board voter concerns over a front bench of privilege by elevating a new breed of state-educated Tory.The Times leads with the news that tens of thousands of parents face "stiff" fines because they have failed to meet the deadline for registering their child benefit payments on their tax returns.The paper says 165,000 higher earning parents, who have carried on receiving payments, did not register for self assessment by the weekend.Amid the deadline for people to apply for Royal Mail shares, the Daily Telegraph says millions of small investors are set to profit from the sale.The paper likens "a late rush" for shares to the interest shown by investors in the privatisation of British Gas and other industries in the 1980s.The Guardian says it understands ministers may raise the share allocation for small investors at the expense of banks because of a growing outcry over the original percentage of shares available to the public.The Financial Times reports that some brokers are extending their opening hours to deal with an expected last-minute scramble for applications.The Guardian carries a claim from scientists that the controversial cull of badgers in England "could now spread TB" because not enough of the animals have been killed.The paper says sources have told it that not even half the number of badgers needed to help curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle have been culled.Some 70% is said to be the minimum kill rate for a cull to be deemed a success.Paul Caruana, who used to work for Defra and has been involved in the latter stages of the cull, tells the paper that organisers hit the "panic button" when they realised the night shoots were not getting the expected results.Meanwhile, cat lovers you have been warned. A purring cat might not be as happy as it sounds, according the Daily Telegraph.Scientists at the University of Lincoln have found that cats release hormones linked to stress when they are constantly petted.So, if you want a happy cat then stop stroking, advises the Daily Mail.</body>

      <title>US Libya raid: Was it legal?</title>
      <description>Why US says abduction on foreign soil was legal</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24435327</url>
      <date>1381162315</date>
      <body>The statement made by the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, that the kidnap of Abu Anas al-Liby complied with United States law is correct - but that will not stifle criticism that the seizure was a flagrant breach of international law.Mr Kerry's confident assertion will, no doubt, have been bolstered by a reminder from State Department legal advisers that a 21-year-old Supreme Court ruling seems to settle the question of whether kidnapping on foreign soil is legal.The case concerned a Mexican gynaecologist accused of participating in the torture and murder of an American narcotics agent in Mexico in 1985. The man was abducted by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration and flown to Texas to stand trial.By a majority of 6-3, the Supreme Court ruled the kidnapping lawful, despite the existence of an extradition treaty between Mexico and the USA.This decision confirmed earlier precedents in which judges in the United States have declined to concern themselves with the manner in which a suspect was brought to the sovereign territory of the US to stand trial.These precedents were famously cited in a Jerusalem court in 1961 to reject a claim by lawyers for the Nazi, Adolf Eichmann, that his kidnapping by Israeli agents in Argentina rendered the prosecution unlawful.Abu Anas al-Liby was indicted by a federal court in Manhattan in 1998 in connection with the bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and there are outstanding international warrants for his arrest. So, John Kerry's argument that he was a "legal and appropriate target" is well-founded.However, the accepted route for bringing to court suspects who are living outside of the jurisdiction of the requesting state is extradition, not kidnapping.There is no extradition treaty between the US and Libya and, even if there was one, it is not all certain that the US government would have chosen that option because of its lack of confidence in the rule of law in Libya.An international law expert, who wished to remain anonymous because he is acting in a Libyan case, said:"What is critical here is the degree of involvement or collusion of the Libyan authorities in this kidnap."There are rumours or allegations that al-Liby was seized by a local militia, but if it was done with the knowledge or approval of the government, that might be used to mitigate what would otherwise plainly be an illegal act under international law."You just can't go around lifting people in other sovereign states."Yet, the United States has a history of seeing things differently.US lawyers, or those representing the US government abroad, have been known to quote the 19th Century practice of bounty-hunting to justify the forcible seizure of suspects abroad to stand trial in the United States.Abu Anas al-Liby had a $5m (£3.1m) price on his head; US jurisprudence is likely to see his capture in the same light as that of any wanted outlaw.</body>

      <title>Too many pupils 'failures at seven'</title>
      <description>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, says a report from Save the Children</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24434515</url>
      <date>1381194837</date>
      <body>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, a charity has warned.Save the Children analysed 2012 data on the performance of pupils at schools in England.It shows the poorest pupils are less likely to have made good progress than their better-off peers.The charity's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: "Many children starting school this term already have the odds stacked against them."In his foreword to the report, he writes "Seven is too young to write off a child," but he adds that without good reading skills "all other subjects are a closed book".The report cites official figures that suggest that by the age of seven the future gap in GCSE results between rich and poor children has already been established.In 2012, about 13% of seven-year-olds, or 76,000 pupils, were not at the expected reading level.Underlying this figure is the achievement gap between children on free school meals and their classmates. Almost a quarter (24%) of children eligible for free meals did not reach the expected level, compared with only 10% of children from better-off families.A different set of figures from the 2012 National Pupil Database shows that fewer than a sixth of pupils who had fallen behind at the age of seven caught up to meet the benchmark of five GCSEs graded A* to C at the age of 16.This suggests that 84% of children who fail to meet expected standards in reading and mathematics at seven are likely to continue to struggle throughout their school careers.The authors recognise "steady and welcome progress" over the past five years on the number of seven-year-olds who can read and write to the expected level.Their analysis has found that even continuing to make this rate of progress between now and 2020 could still leave almost half a million children having fallen behind in their reading by the age of seven.They add that continued progress may be difficult to achieve so even these figures may be optimistic without "bold policy change".Calculations based on lower rates of progress suggest that between 520,000 and 810,000 children could have fallen behind by 2020.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "It is utterly unacceptable that so many disadvantaged children leave primary school without a firm grounding in the basics of reading, writing and maths and that is why we are urgently reforming primary education and giving specific support to disadvantaged pupils."This included the pupil premium paid to schools to support poorer pupils, the phonics test and the "rigorous new primary curriculum" which would mean that "many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers."Save the Children is launching a programme called Born to Read, aiming to help about 23,000 children in England to read over the next four years.</body>

      <title>Scouts announce promise for atheists</title>
      <description>The Scout Association in the UK announces an alternative version of their membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.</description>

      <body>The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.From January, instead of vowing "to do my duty to God", scouts will be able to promise to "uphold our scout values".The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.The Church of England and other faiths have welcomed the move, which follows a 10 month consultation."I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish", said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people."In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life".This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to "my Dharma" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its "determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society".Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: "Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have."Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive."The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girlsLast month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.</body>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The three new members of the shadow cabinet, Rachel Reeves, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <date>1381148054</date>
      <body>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, a union is claiming.A third (32%) of support staff in UK state schools polled by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) said they took classes for absent teachers.Over a fifth (22%) said they took more classes in 2012-13 than in 2011-12.A Department for Education (DfE) spokeswoman said: "The rules are clear - they should not be teaching."The DfE said teaching assistants and other classroom support staff played a vital role in the classroom, short of teaching whole classes of children."The government's recent review of school efficiency showed that, when properly trained and deployed, teaching assistants play an important role in helping to improve learning," the spokeswoman said."It is for school leaders to use the expertise of all staff to ensure any disruption to pupils is minimal and that taxpayers get value for money."The ATL polled more than 1,400 of its members working as support staff in state schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.A spokeswoman for the union said the rules allow classroom assistants to teach small groups of children under the supervision of a qualified teacher, but they should not teach whole classes or prepare teaching material.Higher level teaching assistants may prepare material under the supervision of a teacher but should not be teaching whole classes, while cover supervisors are employed to supervise classes while pupils complete work set by a teacher.A quarter (25.4%) of the teaching assistants and learning support workers surveyed and almost half (49.1%) of higher level teaching assistants said they were asked to cover lessons.Of the 400 who said they stood in for the regular class teacher, 60% said they did the same work as fully qualified teachers, claims the union, while a third (31%) of these staff said they had been used to take classes for three or more consecutive days.The union quotes a higher level teaching assistant at a secondary school in England: "I prepare, teach and mark at least four lessons for two year-7, bottom-set classes, and a year-8 set for at least three hours a week. It is teaching on the cheap."A cover supervisor said: "I have even been asked to give copies of lessons I have prepared to members of teaching staff."A primary school teaching assistant added: "It is unfair that many teaching assistants are teaching classes in the absence of a teacher, and doing the same job as a teacher for much less money."ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Schools are selling children short by using teaching assistants to teach classes when the regular teacher is unavailable."We are totally opposed to this exploitation of support staff who are being used as a cheap option to teachers."It is grossly unfair on them and on the children and their parents who rightly expect their children to be taught by qualified teachers."</body>

      <title>Muslim school reopens after closure</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby reopens after a temporary closure over "health and safety" concerns.</description>

      <date>1381142999</date>
      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has reopened almost a week after it was closed during an Ofsted inspection.The Al-Madinah School shut last Tuesday, citing "health and safety concerns", after one day of inspections.Sources said the school had been rated inadequate in all areas by Ofsted, but a final report has not yet been filed.The school has insisted it was closed on undisclosed health and safety grounds and not due to the inspection.Sources said Ofsted found incomplete records of child protection checks being done for all staff.There have been reports that female teachers at the school were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim.It was also claimed girls were made to sit at the back of the classroom and boys at the front.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state funded but not overseen by the local authority.National Union of Teachers (NUT) spokesman Nick Raine said: "It is a publicly-funded school - if there are health and safety concerns that were serious enough to close the school then what were they and have they been an issue for some time? "Over the weekend Labour politicians asked Education Secretary Michael Gove to clarify matters urgently "to reassure the public".The Department for Education said it was already investigating allegations against the school.Several parents with children at the school told BBC News that they were happy with the school."I would rather it close and they sort it out and now she can back to school and the health and safety is going to be fine," one mother said.The Al-Madinah school, which opened in September 2012, claimed to be the first free school in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils.But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward.A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur."</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <date>1381153697</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <body>A gay couple have said they went to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.The Court of Appeal ruled that legislation which prevented gay, lesbian and unmarried couples from adopting children in NI was unlawful.It was the only part of the UK where the policy existed.However, Stormont's health minister plans to go to the Supreme Court to try to overturn that decision and get the ban reinstated.John Davis and Jason Scorer, who live in County Antrim, had hoped to adopt children from Northern Ireland, but with uncertainty over the legal position they were advised to consider other options."We were very lucky that our original social worker in Northern Ireland had done a lot of homework before she came, to say that we could not move things any further forward," said John, who has lived in Northern Ireland for 20 years."The problem is a lot of people may not be aware there is another option."They contacted adoption and fostering charity PACT (Parents and Children Together).It helped the couple, who are in a civil partnership, go through the process in England with the aim of giving children from there a home in Northern Ireland."There are children waiting in the system (in Northern Ireland) to find families but, unfortunately, we were not allowed to go down that route," said Jason."And that is to the hardship of the children who are here."They adopted two boys at the start of the summer and they started primary school last month."They are getting loved, they are getting looked after and they are getting cared for," said John.They say they know of other gay couples from Northern Ireland who are now considering going through the adoption process elsewhere in the UK, because the issue is still being debated in the courts.The Department of Health at Stormont confirmed that Health Minister Edwin Poots has now applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision that the ban was discriminatory.And he insisted the issue was about stability not sexuality."Unlike other parts of the UK... we have a strong list of adoptive parents who want to take on adopted children," said Mr Poots."I think we should be cautious about changing the system which actually provides the stability those children need."It is not a human right to adopt a child for either a mixed-sex couple or a same-sex couple."Gay and lesbian groups, as well as organisations like BAAF (British Association for Adoption and Fostering), have criticised the minister's decision to continue fighting the issue in the courts.But he said surveys had shown support for his position."What I look at it is where the Northern Ireland public are on these issues and what is in the best interests of the children," he said."There is a lot of public opposition to it."In Belfast, there were people with strong views on both sides of the argument.Those against gay couples having the right to adopt argued that children needed both male and female role models and some claimed it was against their religious beliefs.However, many said that the only important thing was providing a stable home for a child, irrespective of whether the couple were married or their sexuality."You could argue all day about the gay thing - whether it is right that someone who is gay should be gay," says John Davis."But I believe it goes back to the loving, caring environment and stability that you can give these children, that they have not had up to this point."</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>

      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <description>Students in England face a cost-of living-crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, suggest figures from the National Union of Students.</description>

      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <title>Gove pressed over Muslim free school</title>
      <description>Labour asks the education secretary to explain what checks his department have carried out on the Al-Madinah Muslim free school.</description>

      <date>1381015587</date>
      <body>Michael Gove is coming under pressure to explain what checks his department carried out on a Muslim free school which has been closed since Tuesday.Al-Madinah, in Derby, cited "health and safety concerns" when it shut last week. It is due to reopen on Monday.But Labour called on the education secretary to "reassure the public" amid persistent concerns over the school.The Department for Education was already investigating allegations against the school, a spokesman said.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state-funded but not overseen by the local authority.Al-Madinah says it has a "strong Muslim ethos" and when it opened last year claimed to be the first such school in the country for pupils from reception age to 16.Preliminary findings from an Ofsted inspection into the school gave it the lowest possible rating.The Department for Education had asked Ofsted to bring their inspection forward. Allegations had been made by parents and staff that pupils at Al-Madinah had been told to follow strict Islamic practices.Former staff have claimed non-Muslim female teachers came under pressure to wear the hijab head-scarf.It has also been reported that girls were made to sit at the back of class.The school denies pupils have been segregated and says its dress code was made clear to anyone wanting to work at the school.Sources have told the BBC the closure was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff.But ahead of the school re-opening to pupils on Monday, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the situation must be "urgently clarified in order to reassure the public".In a letter to Mr Gove the Labour MP said: "This is, of course, not the first time that there have been questions surrounding your department's oversight of a free school."While I understand that there is an ongoing investigation, the reports concerning this school are of extreme concern to parents and the wider community."Given the confusion as to why the school has closed, and that pupils may be returning to the school on Monday, I would ask that these matters be clarified urgently in order to reassure the public."He called on the department to say what "due diligence" was carried out when the school was approved.And he asked whether there had been "appropriate vetting" of staff and what oversight ministers had had since it opened.Interim principal Stuart Wilson closed the school after Ofsted inspectors shared their preliminary findings with him."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur," a statement on the school's website read.The school "will be open as normal on Monday," Mr Wilson added.A Department for Education spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before the allegations became public."We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."Mr Twigg also questioned what would happen to children at the school if it did not reopen on Monday or had to close again.</body>

      <title>Fewer children 'read in spare time'</title>
      <description>Fewer children in the UK are reading in their own time and one in five says they are embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Concerns delay schools' flu vaccine</title>
      <description>A programme to vaccinate children against flu is delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.</description>

      <body>A programme to vaccinate schoolchildren against flu has been delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.About 100,000 primary school pupils in Scottish health board areas taking part in a pilot programme are being offered the Fluenz vaccine.It is given as a nasal spray rather than the traditional jab.But parents in Pollokshields, which has a high number of Muslim pupils, have complained the spray contains gelatine.A letter sent to Glasgow schools in the wake of concerns cites a World Health Organisation study in 2001 which indicated that Islamic and Jewish scholars had agreed pork gelatine was permissible within a vaccine.However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), whose area contains most of Scotland's Muslims, said it had put back the rollout of the vaccinations "following concerns raised by a small number of parents".The programme is due to resume next week when parents will be offered a choice of the nasal spray or the more traditional jab.Scottish government public health minister Michael Matheson said flu was a "very serious infection" which needed to be vaccinated against.He said: "That is why, for the new programme for children, we are using a quick and painless nasal spray Fluenz, which has proven to be more effective in children and avoids the use of needles."Parents should be reassured that the existing guidance issued in 2001 from the World Health Organisation, prepared by religious scholars, advises that gelatine of porcine origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance."Vaccination is voluntary and we want all parents to have the information they need to make an informed choice."If parents continue to have any concerns, children can be given an alternative safe injectable vaccine which does not contain any porcine gelatine but provides less protection than the nasal spray."He added: "The Scottish Government very much appreciates the help and advice provided by Muslim councils in response to these concerns and a letter has been issued to parents of children in Glasgow to offer reassurance about the use of the Fluenz vaccine."A fifth of the Scottish population will be offered a free flu vaccine, including people aged over 65 and those with conditions that put them at greater risk.For the first time, all two and three-year-olds - about 120,000 children - will be offered the vaccine, as well as 100,000 primary school pupils in health board areas which are taking part in a pilot programme.The programme will be rolled out to eventually see about one million children aged between two and 17 have the chance to be immunised towards the end of 2015.</body>

      <title>Call to revamp IT studies in schools</title>
      <description>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.ICT is no longer regarded as relevant for the future, the report by a steering group says.It said its replacement should encourage creativity, develop real-life problem solving and be flexible enough to evolve to stay current.Education Minister Huw Lewis called the report detailed and thorough.The report also suggested grouping computing with the three main science subjects."A career in IT typically involves some degree of logic, creativity, com­munication and collaboration, managing uncertainty, and problem solving," the report said."This is at odds with the current ICT curriculum that is prescriptive, outdated and documentation heavy, focusing on the consumption rather than cre­ation of software and digital content."It added: "We feel strongly that ICT has lost its meaning and become synonymous with word processing and spreadsheets."By renaming and rebranding it as computing as part of a new curriculum we will have an opportunity to improve these perceptions."The new subject would be broken down into two areas - computer science and information technology.Computer science would include the academic side and encompass programming, while information technology would focus on the use of computers in industry, commerce, arts and elsewhere.The report, prepared by an independent steering group chaired by Stuart Arthur from software experts Box UK, recommended computing should be designed with input from the industry and have an online assessment tool.It also added that digital literacy - the general ability to use computers - should start in primary school when pupils are five years old."We should equip children with the skills and empower them with the knowl­edge and confidence to become innovative digital creators, effective digital citizens and successful entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of the global growth opportunities that exist in the digital economy and beyond," the authors said."We have a unique opportunity to learn from the challenges identified in this report and aspire to become truly world class, not just by delivering a digital Wales but by becoming a world leader in computing and digital skills."It is essential to empower our children by giving them the skills required to con­tribute to the rapidly growing digital economy."Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "ICT in Wales is global and dynamic and I want Welsh learners to be given opportunities to develop the skills required to work in and contribute to the sector."We have concerns that fewer Welsh learners are seeing the value in pursuing a career in ICT and that many learners, as well as the wider public, perceive learning about computing in a negative way."It's therefore of great importance what is currently being taught is relevant to the global economy of the future."We will now take time to consider the report's findings in the context of our wider review of assessment and the national curriculum."</body>

      <body>More children have passed the new phonics reading test for England's five- and six-year-olds this year.More than two-thirds (69%) of pupils in state schools reached the expected level - up from 58% last year.Nearly 180,000 pupils failed to meet the expected standard in the controversial new check, which is carried out at the end of Year 1.Girls did better than boys - almost three-quarters passed - while about two-thirds of boys did so.The statistics were published on Thursday by the Department for Education.This is the second year that pupils have taken the test, which is based on "synthetic phonics", a system that focuses on children being able to identify sounds of letters and groups of letters so that they are then able to decode and read real words.For the check, the children are asked to sound out 40 words, some of which are made up, such as "voo", "spron" and "terg" - to test their reading skills.They need correctly to identify 32 out of the 40 phonic sounds to pass.Ministers say the phonics check will improve literacy standards by helping to identify children who need extra help with reading and say it has helped to increase schools' focus on phonics.Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "We are committed to improving children's reading."The phonics check helps teachers identify those pupils who need extra help in learning to read."Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers and develop a love of reading."Teaching unions say the phonics check does not tell teachers anything they did not know about their pupils and risks labelling some as failures at an early age.And they warn that children could be confused by reading "non-words".Christine Blower, the head of the National Union of Teachers, said: "To be telling five- and six-year-olds that they have failed is quite simply wrong."Children develop at different levels, the slow reader at five can easily be the good reader by the age of 11."In many other countries with successful education systems such as Finland most children haven't even started school until seven."</body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries.Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton.The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries.This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career.The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education."Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton.A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect.In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school.And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers.In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials.This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics.The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea.The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected.Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries.No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey.The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations.They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey.There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London).More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence.But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers.Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed.Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform."To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis.Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted."Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education."This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says.</body>

      <title>Murdered Keanu 'failed' by agencies</title>
      <description>A serious case review into the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams finds police, social services and health workers "failed" to prevent his death.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-24365700</url>

      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <body>An "inspirational" head teacher has been given a suspended prison sentence after admitting false accounting.Sir Alan Davies, 66, of Grants Close, the former head at Wembley's Copland School, in north London, pleaded guilty to creating a false paper trail on bonus payments and allowances.Davies, knighted for his services to education, resigned in 2009.At Southwark Crown Court, Judge Deborah Taylor said: "Your dishonest behaviour represents a fall from grace."Davies had pleaded guilty to six counts of false accounting after he admitted creating eight back-payment documents at the same time.The court heard that Davies paid himself, three staff members and two governors a total of £2.7m over several years through bonuses and salaries.Defending Davies, William Clegg QC, told the court he was an "inspirational" teacher and the offences needed to be taken in context.He said: "This is not a case of documents being forged to permit payments to be made that were unlawful and not agreed or made dishonestly. The position is the opposite."The payments were honestly made and honestly received. This is not somebody seeking to obtain money he was not entitled to."Prosecutor John Black QC added there was no dishonesty in the making or receiving of the payments.He said: "The dishonesty relates to false paper trails in order to legitimise these payments."The Crown say they [paperwork backing up payments] were all generated at the same time, after Sir Alan Davies had become aware of the impending or likely scrutiny, to give the impression the right procedure was being adhered to."Two counts of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud were dropped and conspiracy charges against five others were also dropped.Following the case Davies said: "In some instances I have felt that we were being tried by the media and there were a lot of misrepresentations made in the press, many of which were wholly unfounded."I do, however, have to accept that I did not have all the necessary paperwork in place and I made a profound error of judgment by backdating eight documents."In a statement, Brent Council, said: "The council will always act robustly and take action where allegations of financial irregularities have been made, to investigate and pursue legal action."In this case the guilty plea of false accounting vindicates the actions taken although we are disappointed the Crown Prosecution Service saw fit not to pursue the conspiracy to defraud."</body>

      <title>London top city in university table</title>
      <description>London has more universities ranked in the top 40 of a global table than any other city, although only one of the four makes the top 10.</description>

      <body>London has four universities in the top 40 of a global league table - more than any other individual city - although only one makes the top 10.US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings.In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology.In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings.The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations.Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10.Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia.But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away.Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals.However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king.This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions".The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology.The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20."No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place."There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures.""It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate."Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US"."What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."</body>

      <title>Disabled students 'need campus help'</title>
      <description>Disabled students are calling on universities across the UK to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.</description>

      <body>Disabled students are calling on UK universities to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.A study by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's Trailblazers suggests many students are unable to access areas such as lecture theatres and libraries.It says many institutions are failing to signpost key information such as details of accessible accommodation.The Equality Challenge Unit said many universities were working hard to be as accessible and welcoming as possible.The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 means it is illegal for education providers to treat disabled students less favourably because of their disability.A Trailblazers' survey of 100 UK universities found only half of those questioned confirmed that all teaching rooms, study rooms and libraries were fully accessible for students with mobility difficulties.The research found half of universities questioned said that not all inter-campus transport was accessible.Only a quarter of the universities surveyed had considered disabled students when planning freshers' week information and only a third had a society representing disabled students in the student union.Tanvi Vyas, manager of Trailblazers, said: "We continue to hear about how many universities are still missing the mark when it comes to helping people planning on entering higher education - and helping them to complete their time there."There are plenty of simple measures that universities can take. Providing inclusive freshers' guides, handy information on accessible transport and buildings and support networks can all make a huge difference to students adapting to campus life."We also need the government and local authorities to examine the issue of relocating care packages, which continues to be an enormous struggle for many students studying away from home."Chris Brill, senior policy adviser for the Equality Challenge Unit, which helps universities ensure equality for staff and students, said: "Trailblazers' audit highlights a number of small changes that would make big improvements for students."For example, making sure information is clearly signposted on websites, and ensuring the needs of disabled students are reflected in freshers' week programmes."Students' unions, often a conduit between universities and students, could also be encouraged to consider how they involve disabled students in the democratic structures."Through this, we may see an increase in societies representing disabled students, and better involvement of disabled people in higher education."</body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23931078</url>
      <date>1378381975</date>
      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23261289</url>
      <date>1374016582</date>
      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23197565</url>
      <date>1373478808</date>
      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <title>Old slides shine light on Great War</title>
      <description>An old box of lantern slides sheds light on the men from Belfast who died in the Great War.</description>

      <body>When Fay Rice opened a box of old lantern slides lying hidden in the organ loft of a north Belfast church, she unearthed a treasure trove of bitter sweet memories.Under the dust and the cobwebs, more than 100 men stared back at her.Who knows what their thoughts were as photographer Alex R Hogg had them stand to attention.For some, these were the last portraits - scrubbed up and ready for action in the First World War.In 1918, the committee minutes for Castleton Presbyterian Church - now Alexandra Church - state that Mr Hogg was asked to put together a lantern slide exhibition of "our men at the front".It was to be shown on 16 December of that year - tickets were sent to the families of serving men.They stare solemnly at the camera - some in their uniforms, some in civilian clothes."There are about 77 slides and the images of 137 men are captured there," said Fay."There photographs are very clear and very fresh looking. Some of the men in the pictures had obviously told lies to join up - one man was just 15 and you had to be 17 years old."There are very young men and older men as well."Fay was moved by the portraits and by what happened to those men and their families."It is horrendous - for the ones who did not come home and the tragedy that was for their families and for those who came home and were seriously injured or affected by what they had seen. How could they live with that?"But the slides did not carry the names of the soldiers pictured.When Fay showed her daughter, Karen O'Rawe, she set up a website called: Castleton Lanterns... Shining a light on our men who served in the Great War.So began the quest to name all of the Castleton men. To date, about 20 have been identified."Within a couple of days, 300 people were looking at the site and from that, interest has just mushroomed," said Fay.People started contacting Fay and Karen to identify their relatives and tell their stories - men like James Magill, Ernest McCann and James McCann."The example of James Magill, Francis Ernest McCann and James McCann demonstrate just how closely connected all the Castleton Lanterns men were. They were brothers, best friends, pals and colleagues," said Karen."It's important to find their stories and tell them, to understand their lives and remember them, coming up to the anniversary of the start of the Great War. It is sad to hear the stories of those who were lost or wounded beside those who lived and flourished and I'm sure the families who gathered to watch the lantern slide show in 1918 must have felt something similar."Interest has spread and people from as far away as Australia and Canada have been in touch.Now Frankie Quinn, director of the Red Barn gallery in Belfast has stepped in to help in the quest to identify all of the men pictured in the lantern slides.An exhibition of the slides opens on Thursday 3 October from 18:00 BST to 21:00 BST at the gallery at 43b Rosemary Street in the city.</body>

      <title>Call to delay GCSE entry changes</title>
      <description>Michael Gove is asked to delay last-minute exam system changes aimed at stopping schools in England "gaming" the league tables.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24366724</url>
      <date>1380722998</date>
      <body>Education Secretary Michael Gove has been asked to delay mid-course changes aimed at stopping schools from entering pupils for GCSEs before they are ready.The Independent Academies Association head Nick Weller said stopping GCSE retakes from counting in England's league tables could backfire on pupils.It is claimed that schools enter pupils early so they can bank a key C-grade, only taking exams again if they fail.The government says heads will still be able to enter students for GCSEs early.But it argues that if pupils are entered for exams at the expected time - at the end of a two-year course - they are more likely to do better.Mr Weller, who is chairman of the main body representing state-funded but privately run schools known as academies, said in a letter to Mr Gove that he shared the secretary of state's concern about multiple entries for the same qualification and other aspects of league table "game-playing".But he was worried about "damage being done to students' prospects this year" because the changes were effective almost immediately - affecting the league tables based on next summer's GCSE results.He appealed to Mr Gove to delay the proposed changes so that current GCSE students could continue their courses as planned."I am not sure that the department has fully understood the unintended consequences of previous mid-course changes in relation to the GCSE qualification, and I fear that these latest revisions, if they are as reported, will further undermine confidence in the system," he said.He also questioned whether the Department for Education could clearly distinguish between "gaming" the league tables and doing what was best for students."Many schools will now cancel early entries, despite the fact that students themselves might be better off sitting a paper this winter with the chance to retake if necessary in the summer," he said.He added that academy leaders were "dismayed at the confusion and loss of confidence in the GCSE examination since the summer of 2012".This follows the changes to grade boundaries to GCSE English courses midway through the year, which left pupils with the same marks on different grades. It was the subject of a judicial review against Ofqual and some exam boards by teaching unions, which was not upheld.Mr Weller said: "Sensible reform in the pursuit of rigour should be associated with greater clarity, consistency and logic, not less."And he urged the secretary of state to consult properly with professionals he trusted on any further revisions to the exams system.A Department for Education spokesman has said: "We recognise that early entry can be used effectively in certain cases and schools will continue to be able to enter pupils early for examinations where they feel it is appropriate."However, schools should definitely not be entering children for exams before they are ready. It is not good for pupils to be put in early in a school's hope they can 'bank' a C - it is far better that children study the subject fully and take it when they are ready."A document on its website said the changes were being made to address "the significant increase" in early entry in recent years.The education secretary has previously described early entry as a "damaging trend that is harming the interests of many pupils", adding that there is evidence that "candidates who enter early perform worse overall than those who do not, even after resits are taken into account".The DfE paper continues: "It seems likely that candidates are being entered before they are ready, and 'banking' a C grade where their performance at Key Stage 2 [end of primary school] would suggest that if they had continued to study the subject and taken the GCSE at the end of year 11 they could have achieved a top grade.""If schools decide they wish to withdraw students from November examinations, they should contact their exam board."If schools are confident that pupils will achieve well even when entered early and that early entry is therefore in the interests of the pupil, they should not need to make any changes to entry plans. Any pupil who does enter early from this point on will still be able to retake if they receive a disappointing result."That result will not count towards the performance tables for their school, even if it is an improvement on their earlier entry, but pupils will still be able to use their best result to support applications to further and higher education, or for employment."It comes as head teachers are writing to parents also expressing concern about the changes.A joint letter from the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College leaders says: "Without any notice and with immediate effect, the government has limited schools' ability to enter students early for GCSEs - after we had already planned entries for the year. Early entry can serve many good purposes, including vital 'live' preparation for later exams."It seems that barely a term goes by without another sudden change to GCSE examinations. Worst of all, these changes are often made in the middle of students' courses of study, making it impossible to plan properly or to focus on learning rather than constant administrative change. They changed grade boundaries between exam sittings; they dropped the vital skills of speaking and listening from English mid-course; and now this latest announcement."These changes are often timed to coincide with party conferences or similar events, leading us to fear that students and schools are just collateral damage in party political squabbles."The move, announced last weekend, is one of a number steps brought in aimed at preventing schools from engaging in league table "tricks" that some say may harm pupils' prospects.</body>

      <title>Muslim free school closes doors</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school accused of imposing strict Islamic practices closes after an inspection by Ofsted, but its interim head insists it is temporary.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school accused of imposing strict Islamic practices, such as segregated classrooms, has closed following an inspection by Ofsted.The BBC understands Ofsted's findings were so damning that the acting head of Al-Madinah, in Derby, had little choice but to shut it down immediately.The school said the move was due to a "health and safety issue" but expected it to reopen in the "very near future".Ofsted said it could not disclose its concerns until the inspection ended.It added it had "made some findings and shared them with the principal". The second day of the inspection is taking place later.In a statement on the school's website titled "short term closure", interim principal Stuart Wilson said: "Owing to a health and safety issue, I have taken the decision to close the school... until I am confident that all children are safe on site."As parents, you will be informed directly, and on the website, when you are able to send your children back to school..."Assuring you that we have your children's best interests at heart."In a series of newspaper reports unnamed former staff members of Al-Madinah, which opened as a free school in September last year, had alleged that girls were forced to sit at the back of the classroom.Unnamed female staff members have also claimed they were forced to conform to a strict dress code including wearing a head scarf or hijab - whether or not they were Muslim.When it opened Al-Madinah claimed to be the first Muslim ethos, all-through [reception, primary and secondary] free school in the country.The school's first head teacher, Andrew Cutts-Mckay, left the school after less than a year in the job.Last week, the interim principal told the BBC that he had not received any complaints from colleagues regarding the dress code and that pupils were not being segregated, with girls and boys being treated equally.Ofsted is not the only organisation with concerns about Al-Madinah.The Education Funding Agency - from which the school gets its public funding - is investigating alleged financial irregularities.In a statement, the Department for Education said it was already investigating the school before the allegations became public.It said: ''We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."The school's closure is likely to be embarrassing for Education Secretary Michael Gove, who introduced free schools in 2010 in an effort to raise standards in education.Free schools are state funded but operate outside local education authority control and can be set up by parents and community groups in England.</body>

      <title>Hip-hop Hamlet 'racist and evil'</title>
      <description>Making poor ethnic minority pupils study the classics through "inane, youth-centric, dumbed down" methods is "viciously racist" and "positively evil", the Tory conference hears.</description>

      <body>Teaching Shakespeare with a hip-hop soundtrack is patronising, evil and "viciously racist" to black pupils, the Tory Party conference has been told.Youth mentor and writer Lindsay Johns, a guest speaker invited by Education Secretary Michael Gove, said teachers were "hell-bent on making everything cool or hip".They should "stop genuflecting at the altar of youth", he said."Hamlet doesn't need a hip-hop sound track for young people to enjoy it."Mr Johns added: "It's been doing just fine for the last 400 years.""It's not only incredibly patronising, but also viciously racist to think that black and brown kids in the inner cities will only 'get Shakespeare' if it's set to a hip-hop beat and presented in three-minute, MTV-Base-style chunks."It is positively evil to deny inner city kids access to the manifold joys of hearing their national poet's true voice, in essence their birthright, simply because of a culture of low expectations."Mr Johns said he was tired of "vacuous PC [politically correct] educationalists who took great offence at Mr Gove's drive for a national curriculum more focused on English literary classics and the history of Britain.He said: "Young people need more not fewer dead white men - by dead white men I mean the Western literary canon."You can of course be fiercely proud of your Jamaican, Ghanaian or black British roots and ardently love Horace, Boccaccio and Milton."The two are in no way mutually exclusive and they certainly don't make you any less black or less brown by reading them."The novels of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens were just as relevant to all young people no matter what colour or creed, he said, adding that it was "positively nefarious" to deny access to them.Mr Johns also attacked "bling culture" and "ghetto grammar", which he said were holding some youngsters back and making them sound like they had had "a frontal lobotomy""Our aim is for the young people to confound, not conform to stereotypes," he said.Mr Johns, who himself studied French and Italian at Oxford, also said a portrayal of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge as institutionally racist was "actually putting off ferociously bright, black, brown, and white, working-class kids from applying"."Maybe, just maybe, if you didn't keep on discouraging them from applying in the first place with your duplicitous horror stories of how terrible life is there, then levels of representation would actually get better," he said.</body>

      <title>Teachers in strike action over pay</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close as members of the two biggest teaching unions take strike action in a row over pay, pensions and workloads.</description>

      <date>1380643367</date>
      <body>Thousands of schools were closed as members of the two biggest teaching unions took strike action in a row over pay, pensions and workloads.The walkout affected schools in 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber.It is part of a continuing campaign of rolling regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT.The government said the strike would disrupt learning, inconvenience parents and damage the reputation of teachers.At least 2,500 schools were closed or partially closed.The strikers are angry about changes to their pensions, increased workloads and government plans to bring in performance-related pay.NUT general secretary Christine Blower said teachers could not "stand by and watch our profession be systematically attacked and undermined".She declared the action a "huge success" and added: "There can be no doubt left about the feeling of anger towards this government's treatment of the teaching profession."Strike action is never a step that teachers take lightly and we are very aware and concerned about the inconvenience it causes parents."Unfortunately we are faced with a coalition government that is refusing to listen to the reasonable demands of the profession."Teachers gathered for a series of marches and rallies in support of the strike.Ian Lever, from the NUT in Leicester, said: "Teachers are very angry about what is happening to the education system in this country and are prepared to make a stand on it."These are relentless attacks from this government, not just on our pay and conditions but on the education system in general."As professionals, as people who care about education, teachers are saying 'enough is enough' - we have to do something about this."BBC News Online journalist Max Mulgrew said he had seen about 3,000 people in Birmingham's Victoria Square."I've seen banners from NUT and NASUWT groups from Dudley, Coventry, Warwickshire, Walsall, the West Midlands region and even Wigan," he said.About 2,000 people had gathered in Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and about 800 assembled at Parker's Piece, Cambridge.Susi Artis, a spokeswoman for the NUT in Nottingham, said: "I recognise that for a lot of parents this is really inconvenient and we're very sorry for that. Striking is very much a last resort."Alison Core, a Shropshire primary school teacher, said: "Teachers do not want to strike but we feel we have no choice."Our jobs should not be about pay and targets. The bigger picture is the education of the children and with so many fast changes in the industry, we cannot lose sight of that."Jane Lucas, a parent from Coventry, said one of her children was at home and one was at school.She said: "Luckily, there's a couple of mums that we've managed to rally round and we're going to share the childcare today."It's difficult because I do support any worker who wants to fight for the right of their pensions and pay, it's just unfortunate that it's affecting children."Lisa Chambers, Conservative deputy leader of Suffolk County Council and cabinet member for education, said she had taken her son Alex, 13, with her to County Hall meetings."Unfortunately we don't have grandparents close to us and friends have got to make arrangements for their own children so he's had to come to work with me," she said."I have a diary of commitments to people and I really don't feel I can let people down because of this strike."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "Strike action is a last resort, teachers have been left with no choice but to demonstrate their anger and frustration in the face of their genuine concerns being dismissed and trivialised."Teachers of course deeply regret any disruption to children and families."Such action would have been unnecessary had the secretary of state been prepared to engage in genuine discussions."A Department for Education spokesman said: "It is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are striking over the government's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more."Industrial action will disrupt pupils' education, hugely inconvenience parents and damage the profession's reputation in the eyes of the public at a time when our reforms are driving up standards across the country."In a recent poll, 61% of respondents supported linking teachers' pay to performance and 70% either opposed the strikes or believed that teachers should not be allowed to strike at all."A further regional strike is planned in London, the North East, South East and South West on 17 October.Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.</body>

      <title>UK A&amp;Es seeing 'drunk children'</title>
      <description>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to A&amp;E units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation has found.</description>

      <body>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to AandE units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation shows.Revealing UK-wide data for the first time, it said a total of 6,500 under-18s were admitted in 2012-13.Charities and public health bodies say fewer children are drinking overall, but those who do may be drinking more.The five years of data comes from Freedom of Information requests to 125 of the 189 UK NHS organisations.Prof Ian Gilmore, chairman of the UK Alcohol Health Alliance, told the BBC: "I think in under-11s, it's mainly experimenting, but I think we see children in the 11 to 16-year-old range who are beginning to drink regularly."He added: "There are some encouraging signs in that the numbers of under-18s drinking is probably falling, but those that are drinking are probably drinking earlier and drinking more heavily, so we certainly can't be complacent."Over the last five years AandE departments across the UK have dealt with nearly 48,000 incidents where under-18s have been admitted for drink or drug related illnesses.During 2012/13 there were 293 cases of children aged 11 or under attending AandE with alcohol-related conditions - a third more than in 2011/12 when there were 216 cases.Among teens, more girls than boys are now being admitted, a reversal of the past trend.Ayrshire and Arran Health Board dealt with the highest number of cases last year - with 483 alcohol-related attendances.Morten Draegebo, an AandE consultant at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, said children were exposing themselves to significant danger.He said: "The typical patient may be found in a field. They often need to hide away from any sort of adults in the area so they're picked up by the ambulance service."They have difficulty locating where they are because the description comes through from a distressed half-drunk teenager potentially saying that they're under a tree somewhere in a large park."Eventually they're found but even in summer-time in Scotland they're vaguely hypothermic."They have vomited. The vomit may go down the wrong way into the lungs. They are unable to defend themselves even from assault."Dr Draegebo added: "We have had many cases where teenage, young teenage females have come in saying that they may have been sexually assaulted and they're that intoxicated and are distressed and say, 'I may have been', but they don't even know if they have been or not."On a humane level that is very distressing. I'm a parent, I would hate for that to happen to my daughter."Elaine Hindal, chief executive of Drinkaware, said the incidence of drunkenness among under-11s was "really alarming" and parents must be vigilant."It's really unlikely that children are buying alcohol. When children talk to us in our research, they tell us they get alcohol from home, primarily from their parents and from friends," she said."But parents need to simply be aware of the dangers of drinking, particularly with younger children. Their bodies can't take it, they're more at risk of alcoholic poisoning, they are more likely to be a victim of alcohol-related violence."Across the UK, experts agree that fewer children are drinking now than several years ago, but say the amount being consumed by those underage has stayed the same - suggesting those who do drink are consuming more.Public Health England says one in four underage drinkers consumes more than 15 units a week - the equivalent of seven pints of lager.The official advice from the chief medical officers across the UK is that no children should be given alcohol until they are 16, and alcohol should only be given to older teenagers under supervision of a carer or parent, and never on more than one day a week.A Department of Health England spokesman said: "We know that fewer young people are drinking and being admitted to hospital as a result."But with more than one million alcohol-related hospital admissions overall in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the NHS, costing around £3.5bn every year.

      <title>Library visits drop as cuts bite</title>
      <description>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24296825</url>
      <date>1380290457</date>
      <body>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.The proportion of adults using libraries has fallen from 48% to 36% since 2005, according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).The drop comes as some councils shut branches in an attempt to save money.Around 350 libraries are thought to have shut since April or be at risk, according to Public Libraries News.But cities including Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have had major schemes to open or refurbish their central libraries.The decrease in library visitors has been a relatively steady trend since the DCMS' annual Taking Part survey began in 2005.The drop has been seen in all parts of the UK and all age groups, the survey found.The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip) said the figures were "deeply disappointing".Cilip chief executive Annie Mauger pointed out reductions in staff numbers, spending and opening hours that had been felt over the past few years."Local authorities have had to make tough choices, but libraries are under pressure and cuts to services will mean that visits drop," she said.The body, which represents library workers, called for "stronger political leadership that supports a clear national vision to provide high quality, relevant and well used library services in communities across the country".The figures come days after Cilip passed a vote of no confidence in culture minister Ed Vaizey for his "failures" to intervene on library closures.In a speech in March, Mr Vaizey insisted libraries were not in crisis, saying: "I'm delighted our library service continues to thrive and modernise."Referring to the survey results, a DCMS spokesman said libraries were "still hugely important", with 4.5 million visits per week."Local authorities, of course, are best placed to decide the scale and nature of the services they provide, based on local needs," he said."But it is crucial that they understand what important resources library services are, and adapt and develop services to meet people's expectations in our rapidly changing world."There are great examples of innovation and creativity in the delivery of library services, and we want to see more local authorities doing that."Cllr Flick Rea of the Local Government Association said fewer than 5% of libraries had closed and councils were "working hard to innovate and re-design them" for the future."What is clear is that government can't keep reducing funding and expect councils to be able to keep protecting popular library services in this way," Cllr Rea said."Any further cuts would certainly result in widespread library service closures and stop this positive work in its tracks."Other figures from the survey showed that the proportion of adults visiting museums or art galleries had risen from 42% to 53% since 2005.The East Midlands and north of England have shown the biggest rises in people watching or taking part in the arts, the survey found.Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the overall figures "show once again just how important the nation's arts and culture are to people".</body>

      <title>Call for child mental health checks</title>
      <description>Children as young as seven should be tested in school for their mental health, a Cambridge academic has said.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24263452</url>
      <date>1380132611</date>
      <body>Children as young as seven should be tested in school for their mental health, a Cambridge academic has said.In an article for the British Medical Journal, Simon Nicholas Williams argues that screening pupils at that age would mean problems could be diagnosed and treated earlier.Heads say it is an "interesting idea".Mr Williams, from the university's Institute of Public Health, said three-quarters of adult mental disorders were "extensions of juvenile disorders"."If left untreated, these can lead to more serious social and economic problems in adolescence and adulthood, related to crime, unemployment, and suicide, for example," he wrote.He said early intervention and prevention of mental health problems should be aimed at young people."Introducing mental health screening in schools could enable early diagnosis and treatment of childhood mental health problems and therefore reduce many of the costs associated with adolescent and adult mental health problems," he wrote.He said mental health problems cost the UK an estimated £105bn a year."Physical health checks have been done in schools for more than a century, so why not mental health checks?", he added.Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which represents most primary heads, said the idea was an interesting one.But any such scheme would have to be carefully handled, he said, with the checks carried out by experts."I think we should be checking children for much more than whether they have mastered phonics," he said."The evidence suggests that the earlier we start checking people, the better. But schools themselves are not qualified to do this and health professionals would have to be involved."Mr Hobby added: "We would have to be quite careful about any labels and stigma attached to this. It would have to be done in a sensitive fashion."But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea was a "further reflection of the growing intrusion into our lives of the nanny state"."Children, parents and schools should be trusted. This new initiative is as likely to cause children and parents anxiety and stress as it is to help anyone," he said."Good schools, with high aspirations, inspirational teachers and a broad curriculum, will do far more to support children who may be vulnerable to mental health issues than a screening programme that will, inevitably focus on introspection and the looking for problems where none exist. God help the poor children if this latest initiative gains ground."In his article, Simon Williams said the "stigma associated with a mental health diagnosis is likely a deterrent, particularly for parents", as well as the financial costs involved."However, a programme in which all children are screened, rather than just those who are traditionally deemed at risk, would likely have a de-stigmatising effect," he said."Although many mental health disorders are more common among children from lower socio-economic groups, others, such as anxiety disorders, are just as common, if not more common, among children from higher socio-economic groups."He said such screening could be carried out in groups "cheaply", at an estimated cost of £27 per child, amounting to £18.5 million for all of the UK's seven-year-olds.Lucie Russell, from the Young Minds charity, said mental health screening was a good idea if there was good support for children "with emerging mental health problems", but current provision was "patchy"."Screening as part of early intervention is theoretically a positive step forward, but it must be backed up with comprehensive support and treatment for any identified children and their families," she said.</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Greece crisis: Inside the student-occupied schools</title>
      <description>Angry Greek students taking over their classrooms</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24332586</url>
      <date>1380610490</date>
      <body>Drastic public spending cuts in Greece are having severe consequences for public services including education. With teachers and students now taking direct action, some universities are warning that a whole semester could be written off.Last Monday was no ordinary school day for 17-year-old Enea Tola.At 06:00, Enea and several other senior students climbed the fence of their school and locked the doors. They informed the principal that the students had taken over the school in central Thessaloniki, Greece's second city.On the same day, hundreds of students across the country were staging or preparing to stage their own school takeovers.By the end of last week, more than 100 high schools in Greece had been occupied.The students took the baton from teachers, who had begun rolling strikes only a few days after the school year began.Teachers were protesting against the lay-offs and forced job transfers that are part of Greece's bailout agreement with international lenders.After two weeks the strikes ended and students stepped in."Our main goal is to demonstrate our solidarity with our teachers, who could not go on striking indefinitely," says Enea."It is the only way to make ourselves heard."At Enea's school, no outsiders are allowed to enter the premises. Some students guard the main entrance, while 10 to 15 others spend the night there, turning their desks into beds.In one classroom, a girl is diligently sweeping the floor."You came on cleaning day. We don't want to vindicate those accusing us of vandalising our schools," says Enea, the son of Albanian immigrants, who moved to Greece when he was four years old."We have been severely affected by the crisis. Last year many of our friends fainted from malnutrition. We cannot sit in silence."Illegal in theory, school takeovers are tolerated by the authorities.Across the street from another Thessaloniki secondary school in the suburb of Kalamaria, a policeman is watching as the students gather in the yard to debate their next moves."The police do not intervene. They do not want to go against the people," says one student.Many parents are unhappy."First it was the teachers' strikes, now the student takeovers, soon it will be Christmas vacation. No wonder our education is in such a mess," says the mother of a 16-year-old girl, who did not wish to be identified.And others believe children are learning the wrong lessons."What will happen to 12- to 15-year-old students in junior high school, who learn at this tender age how to break the law?" wrote Paschos Mandravelis in his column for the conservative daily, Kathimerini.For many teachers, however, the turmoil is only a natural consequence of austerity policies imposed by the so-called troika - the officials from the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.Τhe number of teachers in Greek high schools has been cut by 18,000 since last year; 100 vocational schools have been closed; and thousands of teachers are placed on reserve.According to the EU Commission, education spending in Greece, one of the lowest in Europe even before the crisis, has remained steady at around 4% of GDP since 2008. But since the Greek economy has shrunk by almost 25% over the same period, education has suffered an equivalent cut in its actual funding.Thomai Pagiantza, who teaches at an elementary school in Alexandria, a town in northern Greece, says the problems are so grave that the union should have continued its strikes."We have suffered dramatic wage cuts. With 14 years of experience, my monthly salary has been cut from 1,400 to 950 euros [£1170 to £790]. But we are not fighting for money or privileges, as many Greeks think. We are fighting to save education," she says.Greek universities are also paralysed - not by student takeovers, but by the rolling strikes of administrative staff. The governing bodies of several institutions suspended their activities last week, saying they can no longer function.Greek universities have to contribute 1,349 employees to the total reserve pool of 25,000 civil servants, who will receive reduced pay and could lose their jobs if they are not transferred to other government agencies.The situation is aggravating social tensions. Thodoris Karagiannis, a postgraduate student and senior youth member of the ruling conservative New Democracy party, calls the blockades of universities "extortion, with students and parents being the victims".The government insists that the reforms will make Greek education more effective and less wasteful.But university employees say they are striking to save tertiary education and not just their jobs.Last Friday, dozens gathered outside the administrative building of Thessaloniki's Aristotle University, which is the largest in the country with approximately 100,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students.Already on strike for 14 days, they were sitting by the blindfolded statue of Aristotle which dominates the courtyard, drinking coffee and talking about their bleak future.Yannis Kourmoulis, the president of the Administrative Personnel Association, says they will keep fighting."Some department secretariats are staffed by a single employee... How on earth will universities do their job if they lose another 40% of their staff?"</body>

      <title>Nigerian students living in fear</title>
      <description>Nigerian students live in fear following dormitory massacre</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24353555</url>
      <date>1380670758</date>
      <body>Sagir Adam, 21, survived the weekend attack on his agricultural college in north-eastern Nigeria when suspected Islamist militants killed about 50 students sleeping in their dormitory."It was a night of horror," he told me, struggling to find words to describe what happened.Gunmen in military uniform in a convoy of two vehicles and motorcycles stormed the college at about 01:00 - a time when students are asleep in their hostels, surrounded by complete darkness.Yobe State College of Agriculture is down the road from Gujba village. The entrance is fenced but the rest of the campus merges with the bush that stretches from Yobe state into the deep forests of neighbouring Borno state - the stronghold of the Islamist group Boko Haram.Its fighters regard schools as a symbol of Western culture. The group's name translates as "Western education is forbidden".Despite the attack, and others like it, Mr Adam wants to go back to the college and continue with his studies as he believes an education will help him find a job.But he is now back in his home town of Nguru - a four-and-a-half-hour bus journey from Gujba - and his parents will never let him go back to any school as long as the danger of Boko Haram exists.His father has told him that his priority is to stay alive.Yobe state is one of the poorest and educationally disadvantaged states of Nigeria - it is certainly the least developed state in the north-east.Sharing a border with Niger to the north, it is arid and its inhabitants are largely farmers. But farming is becoming more difficult or impossible as a result of growing desert encroachment.Many tertiary students I have spoken to in Yobe's major towns - Damaturu, Geidam, Nguru, Gashua and Potiskum - say their parents have asked them to return home for security reasons.Three states in north-eastern Nigeria have been under a state of emergency since May when a security operation was launched against Boko Haram.Many of the militants left their bases and violence initially fell, but revenge attacks quickly followed - several on schools in Yobe."I always live imagining I can be killed. No-one is sure of what will happen," Potiskum resident Kadai Musa, who has three wives and 15 children, told the BBC about life under the state of emergency.He says none of his children have gone to school in the last six months because of fears of further attacks."We no longer care about anything else except to live and see the next day," he says.Agricultural lecturer Bukar Mustapha can testify to shrinking class sizes. He says the weekend attack may mean teaching unions will refuse to allow staff to go back into classrooms until security can be guaranteed.But there is no security in the remote area around Gujba, a village along a major road linking Yobe with Adamawa state.Apart from some mud houses sparsely strewn over an area the size of two football pitches, Yobe State College of Agriculture is the only prominent feature of Gujba.At the gate of the college there is a security guard, who is usually untrained and armed with a torch light and a bow and arrows.In the early hours of Sunday when the gunmen arrived, they demanded that the night guard show them the hostels for male and female students.He prevaricated, saying that most of the students had gone home for the weekend - only pointing out one dormitory.Other students awoke when they heard the shooting - the sleeping students were killed with guns and a hand-held saw.Some students died running, while others were killed after being mistaken for bandits by villagers as they fled.The gunfire lasted for four hours. Hostels were burnt, the college's shops ransacked.No security agents intervened during this time and the militants eventually left with the college ambulance.When dawn broke, dead bodies could be seen dotted around the hostel area.All day, wailing and tearful relatives hung around the morgue in the state capital Damaturu, 30km (18 miles) north of Gujba, where the dead bodies had been conveyed.The two sons of Ishaku Lawan, a 60-year-old driver, survived the dorm attack."I am grateful to Allah my sons survived," he told the BBC."After previous school attacks in Yobe state, we have been asking government to provide security in other schools but nothing has been done. Now the worst has happened."Most Yobe residents bemoan this precarious security situation.They have been living with on-and-off curfews for more than a year.Motorcycles were banned because of the many drive-by shootings - a trademark of Boko Haram killings.Thousands of young men who earned their living running motorbike taxis are out of work.But now life is more risky than ever.Muhammed Abba, a civil servant in Damaturu, has visited his mother in Maiduguri, in Borno state, every weekend for more than a decade.But in the last two months he has been unable to make the journey, which takes about an hour."In recent days, gunmen of Boko Haram have been blocking the road and slaughtering commuters. They killed over 100 recently," he said."They normally operate in the evenings and early mornings. My mum begged me not to come and see her because of the risk involved."Going to Maiduguri now by road is like a suicide mission."For now schools will officially remain open in Yobe, but they are likely to be abandoned as Boko Haram increasingly targets them.But Mr Lawan is desperate for his sons - Muhammed, 23, and Fusami, 25 - to get an education."I want my sons to be educated. I am 60 and a driver - I don't want my sons to be like me. I will look for a school in a state where there is security," he said.His meagre driver's salary means he will struggle financially, but he says it will be worth it to send his sons to any school outside Yobe state.</body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>A harsh reception for a would-be reformer in Iraqi Kurdistan</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23977422</url>
      <date>1380669333</date>
      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24228473</url>
      <date>1380236413</date>
      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own. We're learning it and they're growing up with it."Perhaps that is why so many parents look to their children for help when their phone stops working - they've spent 10,000 hours on these devices before they turn 21.</body>

      <title>The parents' long goodbye</title>
      <description>How parents cope when children head to university</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24208545</url>
      <date>1380157439</date>
      <body>More than 400,000 youngsters are starting university in the UK this year. That means hundreds of thousands of parents saying goodbye.The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows, nervous families, memories and expectations.This is the very first day at university - parents taking their children and getting ready to say goodbye.It's one of those big events that never makes the headlines but will have been ringed in the diaries of hundreds of thousands of families.On motorways and trains, more than 421,000 youngsters will be making this symbolic journey. After months of anticipation, checklists on fridge doors, last meals at home, last drink with friends, it's now here.At the University of Sheffield, a stream of parents arrive with their sons and daughters at the Endcliffe Student Village. There are balloons, music, banners and the upbeat banter of student radio in a well-orchestrated welcome.It's like the first day at an academic holiday resort. Parents and their teenage children look around the newly-refurbished student union bar as if they are about to begin one last family trip.But under the South Yorkshire autumn sunshine there's no escaping the poignancy. For parents, this is what they've always wanted for their children and many will have quietly dreaded. It's a bittersweet journey.No one wants to spoil this big first day, but it's no secret that they'll be thinking about the empty room at home.There are T-shirted volunteers all around ready to help anyone looking lost. They know the teenagers are going to have worries.And what do the new arrivals most want to know about? Internet connection, of course. It's their most urgent concern, say the helpers. Not so much Generation Y as Generation Wi-fi.Meanwhile their dads, looking misty-eyed, have the conversations that they have at times of big emotions. They talk huskily about parking problems and the fleeting nature of mobile phone signals.It's a mixture of epic understatement and Alan Partridge as parents fill the long silences by talking about the ring roads that have brought them there.Suitcases and boxes full of gadgets are lugged along neat paths in the shade of newly planted trees. There will soon be 3,000 youngsters living here. There's a beach-themed party already lined up and a whole week of ice-breaking activities.There's a long gaggle of arrivals waiting to check in. There are girls who have travelled with clingy soon-to-be ex-boyfriends; there are siblings suddenly close to each other instead of fighting.But the biggest group are mothers, fathers and a teenager now taller than them. They stand together like they might have done on the first day of primary school. If there was a Club 45 to 55, it would look like this.Their estates and people-carriers look like the cars bought a few years ago for a young family, the ghosts of child seats still pressed into the upholstery.The university has put on a friendly face to help the new students over this threshold.In fact, universities have had a major collective make-over in their bid to attract students. There has been a campus building boom since the increase in tuition fees.Alongside the rigorous academic stuff, universities are also selling a leisure experience. It's part-science park, part-theme park.The student union bar at Sheffield has been re-vamped. Forget student unions with sticky carpets and punctured leatherette. It's now all clean, airy and comfortable and the bar manager at Sheffield says these days it's driven more by food than booze.If parents want to visit, Sheffield has just opened its own campus hotel.Even on their first day, it won't be an entirely unfamiliar environment for the new students. Before they arrive they will have been using social networking to get to know their future flatmates. They're bringing enough computer technology to launch a space mission, so keeping in touch with home should be easier than ever before.There is still time for some instant re-invention. Starting at university is one of the most significant changes for any young person. They will have spent several weeks deciding the big academic questions, like what they should wear in the bar.The first night is the stuff of myth. There are people you meet and then spend three years avoiding and people you meet on a corridor and then become friends with for the rest of your life. There will be freshers' week stories of excessive drinking, ineffective cooking and misguided outfits.These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked hard for years to achieve and for which they'll be paying for many years afterwards.But after the small talk over cups of coffee and a constant stream of text messages, there is no escaping where this is heading. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it.The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways.</body>

      <body>Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.A source said a sub-committee of the Privy Council, containing Lib Dem and Tory cabinet ministers, thought the proposals were "flawed".But sub-committee chair Danny Alexander insisted no decision had been made.The full Privy Council is also looking at an alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners.It is due to announce its decision on the press proposals on Wednesday and the alternative plan on 30 October.Press regulation options are being considered in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, which was set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Politicians and the press have been at odds over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the regulator.The government's proposals published in March have cross-party backing and the support of campaign group Hacked Off.There are a series of key differences between the industry's plan for press regulation and that agreed by politicians and campaigners.Newsnight's political editor Allegra Stratton was told Privy Council members felt proposals for self-regulation put forward by newspapers did not meet the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report.Mr Alexander, who told the BBC the sub-committee met on Monday and the full Privy Council will meet on Wednesday to consider the press proposal, said there were a "few remaining" details to be decided - but insisted "no final decision has been made".But ministers "do look set to reject" the form of regulation put forward by newspapers, BBC political editor Nick Robinson said.The Privy Council sub-committee sub-committee consists of four Tories and two Lib Dems - and both parties have been critical of the press proposals - he added.Steve Hewlett, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, told Newsnight that newspaper publishers felt the process had been far from transparent.He said: "People I have spoken to are furious and are now considering whether there might be a legal challenge to this decision by the Privy Council."The newspapers' proposals would:Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of the Sun, said the news was not a shock."It's what we'd been given fairly clear clues would happen," he said."I think it has to be seen as a great victory for the forces of oppression of a free press - Hacked Off in particular - and the politicians who have gone along for the ride."Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said the press's plan had been a "delaying manoeuvre" by the big national newspapers."The problem with the papers is that they do not want to deal fairly with complaints," he said.Mr Cathcart said there was a "rare unanimity" in Parliament on this issue, and the press was refusing to compromise "like an errant child on the naughty step with his fingers in his ears".He said only the press stood against the consensus in politics and the public which said: "We want Parliament's royal charter - Leveson's royal charter - and we want it now."Earlier, Gerry McCann said the newspaper industry's plans for press regulation were "a gentlemen's club agreement" and should be rejected by politicians.The father of missing Madeleine McCann said the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry were the "minimum acceptable".Mr McCann and his family were subject to intense press attention after Madeleine went missing while they were on holiday in Portugal in 2007.</body>

      <body>Excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.The College of Emergency Medicine said increased demand and the complexity of work was causing staff sickness and burnout.Its survey of just over 1,000 UK consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable.It comes amid mounting concern about the ability of AandE units to cope this winter.At the start of this year, the NHS in England missed its target of fewer than 5% of patients waiting more than four hours, as waiting times hit their highest rates for nine years.Ministers have since announced a £500m bailout fund for the next two winters to help those hospitals with the most acute problems.The college has always maintained that a shortage of doctors is a contributory factor to the problems.Previous reports have highlighted the fact that AandEs do not have enough consultants.The average is just over seven per unit when it should be 10 - and 16 for the largest hospitals - according to the college.But now the college is warning that the shortages are beginning to affect the consultants who are in place.In the survey, 94% complained they were working excessive hours - with more than half saying they were regularly doing more than a fifth extra on top of their contracted time.The report also uncovered a small, but growing problem with consultants emigrating.Last year 21 left the UK compared with three in 2008.College vice president Dr Taj Hassan said: "Senior medical decision-makers in emergency medicine provide one of the most vital strands in maintaining safety."A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis."Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the situation was "unacceptable"."Patients have incredible respect for emergency medicine teams, but those teams need to be backed up with the funding they need to do their jobs without being stretched in this way."A Department of Health spokesman commented: "We know we need to do more to support emergency departments to do their important work through winter and beyond."That is why we are investing £500m and we tasked Health Education England with developing plans to encourage more medical students to become AandE doctors in the future."He also said a major review of the urgent and emergency care system - led by medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh - would be reporting shortly.</body>

      <title>Help to Buy costs being unveiled</title>
      <description>Banks begin to unveil details of the mortgages they will offer under the government's expanded Help to Buy scheme.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24430010</url>
      <date>1381220487</date>
      <body>Banks have begun to unveil mortgages which they will offer under the expanded Help to Buy scheme.The government's initiative is designed to enable buyers who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC and Virgin Money joining later.There have been concerns the scheme could fuel a housing price bubble, but Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander told the BBC that there is no UK price boom."People who think that there's a housing bubble should get out more. They should get out of Kensington and Chelsea, and go to Manchester or Birmingham, and major towns across the country," he said.He said the scheme would help those people to who do not have "piles of cash" for a mortgage deposit.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.HSBC said it would join the scheme later in the year, and Virgin Money said it would offer Help to Buy mortgages from January.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is expected to be up to 0.9% of a property's sale price. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Those who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the Conservative Party conference that the second phase of the scheme would be brought forward by three months from January.A number of lenders have expressed an interest in joining the second phase. Lloyds Banking Group and RBS are the most prominent. Other lenders have yet to commit.Some products from the Halifax and Bank of Scotland will be available from Friday, with deals from other lenders expected to be in place by January.Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September.The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Mr Alexander said the Treasury Committee was right to say that Ministers should keep a close watch on Help to Buy. "We will make adjustments if they (the FPC) recommend them," he said.He also rejected criticism that the government should be tackling a house supply shortage, rather than demand. "All the housebuilders tell us is that what is holding them back (building more houses) is a lack of demand," he said. "There are lots of other policies that this government is doing to tackle demand."Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.</body>

      <title>Jail drugs 'easier to get than soap'</title>
      <description>The UK's largest privately-run prison is failing to tackle drugs, which inmates say are now easier to obtain than soap, a highly critical report reveals.</description>

      <date>1381217048</date>
      <body>The UK's largest privately-run prison is failing to tackle drugs, which inmates say are now easier to obtain than soap, a report reveals.Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick, said the findings on HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton, were "unquestionably concerning".One in seven prisoners said they had developed a drug problem while at the prison, the report found.Operator G4S said it had already taken steps to tackle the problems.The prison opened in April 2012 and houses about 1,600 inmates. The firm said that running a new jail was a challenging operation.Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, said the size of HMP Oakwood made the complex process of opening a new prison "even more acute".It is not the first time HMP Oakwood, a category C jail, has come under fire; in July it was one of two private prisons to receive the Ministry of Justice's lowest rating.At the time, the Howard League for Penal Reform described it as a "damning indictment" of the role of private firms in justice.Commenting on the latest report, the Howard League's chief executive, Frances Crook, said: "This private prison has been open for a year-and-a-half and it is getting worse, not better."On a payment-by-results model it would be closed because G4S are being paid for it and it is not delivering results."While there was praise from HMI Prisons for the facilities at HMP Oakwood, including accommodation, as well as its handling of segregation, there was also widespread criticism of many areas of prison life.In all four main tests - safety, respect, purposeful activity and resettlement - the prison was recorded as either insufficient or poor, the lowest rating.During an unannounced visit from 10-21 June, inspectors found a wide range of illicit drugs "were easily available" while drug usage was also high.Inspectors said that while positive drug test results were high, it was all the more concerning when the number of prisoners who refused tests was taken into account.As well as heroin and a synthetic drug, inspectors found prescribed medications also in circulation, with severe criticism of the healthcare department in the prison.The main healthcare provider - Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust - has been served with a statutory improvement notice by the Care Quality Commission following a critical report last month.Among the problems in that department highlighted by HMI Prisons was the "chaotic" administration of medications.While many inmates missed doses, inspectors said "tradable" medications were "routinely prescribed" with numerous opportunities for them to find their way into the prison population.The report said some effective counter measures were being introduced, but the prison "lacked a focused strategic approach to tackling drug supply and demand".In response, Mr Petherick from G4S said: "We have already taken steps to make improvements, appointing a dedicated taskforce to address problem areas, such as the prevalence of drugs, while providing additional funding where necessary. This is starting to yield results."Today we can see a reduction in the amount of drugs entering the establishment, the use of force is reducing and better care, sentence plans and resettlement arrangements for prisoners are being put in place."We are also working with the Ministry of Justice and the healthcare and education providers, who do not report to us, to address the issues raised in this report."HMP Oakwood's rehabilitation work with its 300 sex offenders was also highly criticised in the HMI report.Inspectors said there was no planned approach for addressing the behaviour of those inmates, many of whom "were in denial of their offending"."A large number of these prisoners were due for release without their offending having been addressed," the report said.Mr Hardwick said there was a lot to do "before Oakwood is operating anywhere near effectively".He added, however, that a new director had been appointed, who seemed to understand what needed to be done.Mr Petherick said: "We do not underestimate the effort which will be required to bring Oakwood up to the standard we have achieved at our other prisons."However, as the experience of staff develops, the regime becomes fully embedded and our reporting systems continue to improve, the months ahead will see significant further improvements in performance."All our staff are absolutely committed to helping Oakwood become a first-class facility which secures the very best outcomes for both prisoners and taxpayers."Director of the Prison Reform Trust, Juliet Lyon, said: "Slashing prison budgets while warehousing ever greater numbers overseen by largely inexperienced staff has come at a dangerous cost."This prison is not a model for the future but a warning."</body>

      <title>EU exit would be suicide, says Clegg</title>
      <description>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union and supporters must "speak up", Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <body>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union, Nick Clegg has warned.The deputy PM said a new "coalition in the national interest" was needed to make the case for membership, and asked businesses and charities to help.He attacked David Cameron's proposed referendum, calling it a "short-sighted political calculation" which could see the UK "stumble out" of the EU.Eurosceptic group Business for Britain accused Mr Clegg of "scaremongering".In a speech at the London headquarters of Swiss technology firm Buhler Group, Mr Clegg said EU withdrawal would leave Britain "isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard" and not "taken seriously" by world superpowers.He has written to 100 businesses, charities and trade groups urging them to speak out about the benefits the EU brings."My great fear, in all of this, is that pro-Europeans are being too slow to wake up to the danger ahead," the Liberal Democrat leader said."The day I dread - the day I hope never comes - is a time when it is all too late: Britain has stumbled out of the EU, and we look back to these days and say we should have done more."It will not be enough to speak up on the eve of a referendum. We need to start challenging some of the ludicrous myth-making by the isolationists now."Mr Clegg said he accepted a referendum was inevitable but believed it should be held after the change to EU rules.Mr Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election.But Mr Clegg said that was designed to "plaster over" internal Tory divisions over Europe until after the 2015 general election.Mr Clegg said: "Next May the Euro elections are bound to become a proxy for the bigger questions of 'in versus out' - a debate that will play out in the 2015 general election, too."He argued that "you cannot overstate the damage" that leaving the EU would do and predict that having to negotiate individual trade treaties would take a decade."We simply will not be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers, if we're isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard," he said.On Sunday Conservative backbench MP Adam Afriyie said he would try to force the government to hold the referendum in 2014, and Mr Clegg said it was "not even clear" Mr Cameron would be able to delay the vote until 2017.He also questioned whether any reform of Britain's relationship with the EU would "ever be acceptable to the large swathes in the Conservative Party who want to be semi-detached from the EU or out of it altogether".Demonstrating another divide with his party's coalition partners, he called the European Convention on Human Rights a "huge success for European co-operation".Home Secretary Theresa May, who has clashed with Strasbourg judges over various cases including the process of deporting extremist preacher Abu Qatada, has indicated the UK could leave the convention.Business for Britain said Mr Clegg's comments risked undermining the prime minister's attempt to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.</body>

      <title>Post-Yes defence plan 'would cost'</title>
      <description>The UK government believes establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.</description>

      <body>The UK government believes that establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.The claim will appear in the latest Coalition analysis paper prepared by UK civil servants.The Scottish government proposes a £2.5bn defence force if there is a "yes" vote next September.A spokesman said an independent Scotland would have first-class conventional forces.Meanwhile the BBC has seen an internal Ministry of Defence (MoD) briefing document on Scottish independence.It raised concerns about the effect a "yes" vote would have on England, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying the debate matters because of the potential effect of Scottish independence on "our politics, our economy, our standing" - referring to the rest of UK.The document also suggested that about 500,000 votes could "swing the result" of the referendum "either way".Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will promote the UK's current defence set-up during a speech in Edinburgh later.The 86-page analysis paper is being published after MPs on the Commons Defence Committee said it would be "remiss" of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) not to consider the implications of independence, including the future of Trident at the Faslane base.The document will focus on funding, jobs and the problems involved in splitting up an integrated military.The report concludes that the transition to an independent force would be complex.One extract from the analysis says: "Adapting the functions of Scotland's defence footprint would result in a substantial burden on the public finances of an independent Scottish state during establishment, and duplication of costs thereafter for the essential services currently provided on a UK-wide basis."It is difficult to predict how long the establishment phase would last, but given the complex, integrated nature of the UK armed forces and the absence of command and control structures and other essential components in Scotland, this would not be an easy process."Even basic re-design of military bases is a costly undertaking requiring substantial investment to cater for different operational needs."It added that negotiations over assets and liabilities such as equipment, basing and other infrastructure "would be difficult".The report also said that the issue of personnel would present an "extremely difficult challenge to overcome".However, the MoD said picking the UK military apart "would not be impossible".A Scottish government spokesman said he welcomed the "important acknowledgement" from the UK government that an independent Scotland would stand to "inherit a fair share of current UK defence assets".He added: "An independent Scotland will have first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and co-operating with international partners - but we will not waste billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons."We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane, which will be Scotland's main conventional naval facility, and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases."</body>

      <description>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.</description>

      <body>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.Local councils have already been warned they will be exposed to more cuts than in previous years.A Welsh government source said ministers were preparing to deliver "the toughest budget since devolution".However, BBC Wales understands a budget deal with the opposition could be announced as early as Tuesday.Without an overall majority in the assembly, Labour will need an agreement from the opposition to approve its spending plans, worth about £15bn.John Rae, director of resources with the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We estimate we are facing cuts of around 4% after the local government minister warned us we'd be looking at English-style reductions."Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said there had been "a level of protection" to local government in Wales, and a study had shown that until now councils in Wales probably had taken "half the cut that councils in England had faced".He added that all the councils in Wales had their own priorities, but services in "discretionary areas" such as leisure, culture, planning, libraries, highways, street lights and economic development would be affected.The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for not protecting the health budget against inflation.Spending on the NHS has been frozen in recent years - meaning it has been cut in real terms after taking account of inflation.A review of the health budget was carried out over the summer.Speaking ahead of the draft budget, shadow finance minister Paul Davies AM criticised the situation in the NHS in Wales where "patients are routinely waiting over four hours to be seen in AandE".He added: "For the sake of our NHS, Carwyn Jones must use this draft budget to reverse Labour's damaging health cuts."In the last two years, Labour has done separate budget deals with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.This year, Plaid and the Lib Dems have joined forces to negotiate a deal with the government.An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said the UK government's block grant to Wales in 2013/14 would be around 9.4% smaller in real terms than it was in 2010/11.More cuts announced for the two years after that would take the reduction to 12.2%.</body>

      <body>Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has criticised the prime minister for comments he made about how Britain will mark the centenary of World War I.David Cameron said he wanted to see a "commemoration that, like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, says something about who we are as a people".Paxman told the Radio Times that centenary events should "have almost nothing in common" with the Jubilee.He spoke of concerns the centenary could become a "celebration of war".Mr Cameron's comments were made in a speech at the Imperial War Museum in London in October last year.He promised a "truly national commemoration" to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war - in 2014, Armistice Day in 2018, and the dates of major battles in between.Paxman, whose great uncle died in the war, said that "not to acknowledge the war's significance would be wilful myopia", but that "the whole catastrophe has been overlain with myth and legend".But the 63-year-old, who also presents University Challenge, said the Jubilee was "an excuse for a knees-up in the rain to celebrate the happy fact that our national identity is expressed through a family rather than some politician who wants the job to gratify his vanity"."A number of distinguished fellow citizens, like the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy and the thoughtful musician Brian Eno, are worried that the events will turn into a celebration of war. Only a moron would 'celebrate' the war," he added.He added: "We shouldn't 'celebrate' the outbreak of the First World War. But not to recognise that it was one of the most consequential events in our history would just be perverse."The prime minister used the speech to announce that more than £50m has been allocated for a "historic" commemoration of World War I.</body>

      <body>Funding for the BBC's arts coverage will go up by 20%, the broadcaster's director general will announce later.Tony Hall - who used to run the Royal Opera House - says he wants to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand and new television series fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr.The director general, formerly the BBC's head of news, returned to the corporation following the Jimmy Savile scandal.He wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.In a speech on Tuesday he is expected to announce new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.An experimental digital service, known as The Space and developed by the BBC and Arts Council England, is also due to be relaunched in 2014."Arts programming sits right at the heart of the BBC and is a vital part of who we are, but I want us to to be much more ambitious," Lord Hall said."We need to showcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer to the widest possible audiences."The BBC's arts correspondent David Sillito said Lord Hall is keen to "return the BBC back to the founding principles of its first director general John Reith to inform, educate and entertain"."We already know a few of the details of today's speech but this is being presented as something rather broader, an outline of Lord Hall's vision of the future," he said.An enhanced iPlayer, allowing users to personalise their viewing and listening choices, is expected to be announced.Lord Hall is also due to announce major new television series featuring two faces familiar to BBC audiences.Simon Schama will front a five-part series in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery, exploring the history of Britain through portraiture.A series looking at the greatest writers in Scotland will be presented by journalist Andrew Marr.And there will be a series of six BBC One programmes seeking to uncover the "hidden heroes" of British art, with 10 amateurs competing for the title of Britain's best artist.The announcement is part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and comes as the corporation is in the process of cutting 2,000 jobs by 2017 after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <title>Scouts announce promise for atheists</title>
      <description>The Scout Association in the UK announces an alternative version of their membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.</description>

      <body>The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.From January, instead of vowing "to do my duty to God", scouts will be able to promise to "uphold our scout values".The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.The Church of England and other faiths have welcomed the move, which follows a 10 month consultation."I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish", said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people."In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life".This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to "my Dharma" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its "determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society".Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: "Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have."Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive."The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girlsLast month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.</body>

      <body>Poor conditions for home care workers mean elderly and disabled people are "vulnerable to neglectful or abusive treatment", a report has warned.Staff face poor pay, high pressure and a lack of support, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said.The EHRC called on local councils to change the way care was commissioned.The Local Government Association said authorities were working to improve a system that is "widely recognised as being significantly underfunded".In particular, the EHRC insisted local authorities must ensure workers were paid the minimum wage. Staff are often recruited through external agencies.The EHRC pointed out that wages could in effect be reduced by not taking into account time between visits.The report said: "We recognise the severe financial pressures local authorities are under, but unless commissioning practices change, the threats to older people's human rights will continue."Care workers conduct many tasks similar to those of nurses, but do not have the same status, according to the commission.EHRC commissioner Sarah Veale warned: "The current system of commissioning and funding home care is increasingly unsustainable as the number of people requiring care grows every year."Low status, low pay and poor working conditions are leading to high turnover of staff and putting older people's human rights at risk."Katie Hall, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's community wellbeing board, said: "Helping people maintain their independence and dignity in old age is one of the most important things councils do."This report offers constructive feedback on the work local authorities are doing to improve a system that is widely recognised as being significantly underfunded."As the report acknowledges, the social care system is under enormous strain with unprecedented cuts to council funding making it increasingly difficult to meet the escalating demand for care which is being caused by our aging population."She stressed that local authorities did not contract services at rates costed below the minimum wage.Heather Wakefield, head of local government at the Unison union, insisted that cuts could never be an excuse for "reckless" commissioning.Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said: "We want to create a fairer society where everyone receives better care and to achieve this we need a skilled and fairly rewarded workforce."There are too many examples of employers paying people less than the minimum wage by not taking account of travel times, or of councils buying short care visits that leave people waiting to get into or out of bed, to eat and drink or take their medication."The charity Leonard Cheshire Disability has complained that short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise.It said 60% of councils in England used 15-minute visits which it claimed were not long enough to provide adequate care.The government responded by saying the Care Bill would prevent "inappropriate" short visits but would not ban 15-minute visits.</body>

      <body>A doctor who prescribed rest, ice, and comfortable shoes for a woman who later died of a blood clot, was medically negligent, a coroner has ruled.Jacqueline Allwood, 47, died 10 days later after a blood clot travelled from her leg to her lung.Dr Saurabh Adlakha knew of the family history of deep vein thrombosis, Southwark Coroner's Court heard.Recording a narrative verdict, medical negligence by Dr Adlakha contributed to her death, said coroner Andrew Harris.The inquest was told Dr Adlakha suggested Ms Allwood had probably suffered a sprained calf picking up Christmas decorations in December of 2012.After limping into the Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre she was told to take some ibuprofen, rest, use ice and stretch the muscle and to wear more comfortable shoes.But ten days later Ms Allwood died when a blood clot travelled to her lung."The consequences of missing a DVT are, as in this case, catastrophic," said Mr Harris.He referred Dr Adlakha to the General Medical Council for review.Outside court, Ms Allwood's daughters Tanya and Leanne Allwood said they were content with the outcome and although they did not want Dr Adlakha to be punished, they did want to believe he would learn from his mistake."We would never, never want to see another family go through what we have," Tanya Allwood said.Her mother had been "one of the most sincere, nicest people you could meet", she added.Dr Adlakha earlier told the hearing he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because "I don't want to be here again".</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that new UK coins have been produced to mark a royal christening.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace - just over three months after his birth.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>MP queries benefit reform success</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefits are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, according to a senior Welsh Conservative MP.</description>

      <date>1381219157</date>
      <body>Changes to housing benefits are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, according to a senior Welsh Conservative MP.David Davies, on a visit to Blaenavon, Torfaen, blamed a shortage of smaller properties for people on benefits to move into compared to large cities.The reforms see housing association and council tenants having benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.Since April it has meant a 14% cut for one spare room and 25% for two.Mr Davies is chairman of the UK Parliament's Welsh Affairs Select Committee which is looking at how the changes - which critics have called the "bedroom tax" - are working in Wales.The committee is due to publish its own report on the changes shortly.Monmouth MP Mr Davies said: "These reforms are not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham where there is a larger stock of smaller properties."He was speaking as the BBC Wales Week in Week Out programme went behind the scenes with Bron Afon Housing Association, which has 509 properties in Blaenavon but only 23 one-bedroom flats.A third of the larger homes are under-occupied and affected by the benefit changes.Mr Davies met residents in the town as part of Tuesday's programme.He said ministers should be up front that some people would lose out from the UK government changes when they did not deserve to.One woman is losing £21 a week due to the changes and now faces having to leave Blaenavon where her family has lived for generations.Gail Harris has rented the same three-bedroom house for 25 years and now faces the prospect of having to leave the town if she cannot find a smaller property.She has more than £400 arrears and said the changes were "really cruel".Mr Davies told the 59-year-old he was "sorry" that she may be one of the people who could lose out."There has to be a recognition - and ministers may be reluctant to do this - when you change the law there are unforeseen and unfortunate consequences," he told her."In other words there are some people who will lose out who don't deserve to lose out - and I believe you could be one of those and I am really sorry for that."He added: "That doesn't mean we can reverse the whole thing or change it, because there is a wider issue."With limited housing stock and very limited money you can't have a situation where large numbers of people are under occupying - people living on their own in social housing with two or three bedrooms."That situation couldn't be allowed to continue."Mr Davies also provoked anger when he spoke to a young couple."You are not going to like what I have to say to you," he told 17-year-old Amy Evans and her partner Lloyd Mulry."The government have brought this in because we are in a terrible financial situation - absolutely unbelievable."And the days when we were able to fund people in your situation are gone."He told Amy he would move back home if he was in their position and that Lloyd should leave Wales for somewhere like London if he could not find work in Blaenavon.Housing officer Claire Dullea told the programme she could see why the legislation had been introduced.But she added: "If we haven't got those one bedrooms available for people to be able to move into then it's not going to happen - and those people left in the three-bedroom houses paying the bedroom tax are really, really struggling."Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales, Tuesday 8 October at 22:35 BST.</body>

      <title>200 offered MMR in measles school</title>
      <description>Two hundred pupils at a secondary school linked to four suspected cases of measles and one confirmed case are being offered the MMR vaccination.</description>

      <body>Two hundred pupils at a secondary school in Neath Port Talbot are being offered the MMR vaccination.Tuesday's special session has been organised following one confirmed case of measles and four suspected cases linked to Cwmtawe School in Pontardawe.Two pupils and a member of staff have been affected by the outbreak, said health officials.There are two other suspected cases, believed to be relatives who are pupils at another school.Public health officials said those two probable cases had been identified in children at Ysgol Y Cribarth, Abercrave, Powys.Parents of children who are not protected against measles but who are showing symptoms, including a fever, runny nose and rash, are being asked to keep their children at home.Health officials said a disappointing number of children at Cwmtawe had been vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.But at Ysgol Y Cribarth, the number of unvaccinated children is so small Powys Teaching Health Board is making arrangements for children to be immunised individually.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The Swansea area epidemic saw suspected cases first reported last November before it spread to mid and west Wales.By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic.The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.Two MMR doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.</body>

      <title>'House prices up' as demand grows</title>
      <description>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers forces house prices up in Scotland, according to a survey.</description>

      <date>1381190817</date>
      <body>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers has forced house prices up in Scotland, according to a monthly survey.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found house prices increased in September.Last month, 32% more respondents reported prices rises rather than falls in the Rics survey.A net balance of 78% more surveyors also reported an increase in new-buyer inquiries.However, Rics said the lack of homes coming onto the market resulted in the number of new instructions failing to keep pace with the "burgeoning" level of demand.Looking ahead, more than half of those surveyed expected prices to continue to rise in the next three months.Responding to the latest survey, Rics director Sarah Speirs said: "It's encouraging that the market is starting to improve in all parts of the country, with more buyers looking to make a move and more sales going through."Even so, it's a big concern that the supply of property coming to the market is lagging so far behind demand, particularly with the recent launch of Help to Buy in Scotland."This imbalance is likely to result in further upward pressure in prices over the coming months, particularly in popular areas."The report comes as it was revealed that house prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the last decade.Data from the Nationwide Building Society showed that the increase is only matched by Islington and Westminster in London.The growth in the north east has been largely put down to the expanding oil and gas industry and the workers it attracts to the area.</body>

      <title>MPs question economic case for HS2</title>
      <description>A committee of MPs concludes there are serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link will offer value for money.</description>

      <date>1381188013</date>
      <body>A committee of MPs has voiced serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link would offer the UK value for money.Members of the Treasury Committee said there were "serious shortcomings" in the current cost-benefit analysis for HS2.They said the economic case must be looked at again.A government spokesman said HS2 was vital for the UK to meet its "urgent capacity needs".HS2, which stands for High Speed Two, is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033.The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock.The Committee's report called for a more convincing case for HS2 from the Treasury."We need reassurance that it can deliver the benefits intended and that those benefits are greater than those of other transport schemes - whether in the department's project pipeline or not - which may be foregone," it said.The MPs said the government should formally reassess the project and proceed only once three criteria are met:The government spokesman said the project was on course, under control and would be delivered within the agreed budget."We are confident that our analysis is robust and conforms with government spending guidance," he said."The case for HS2 will be further improved when we publish shortly the updated strategic case - including cost-benefit analysis - which will show high value for money for the project."The HS2 plans have had the backing of all three main political leaders but are strongly opposed by some backbench MPs.However, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has hinted Labour might ditch the project over its cost if the party regains power.A recent report for HS2 Ltd found the project could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service.But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it said.</body>

      <body>England left-back Ashley Cole will miss Friday's World Cup qualifier against Montenegro because of a rib injury.The 32-year-old was hurt during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Norwich, and has been replaced in manager Roy Hodgson's squad by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs.Cole, who has won 105 caps for the national team, will remain with Chelsea for more treatment.It is not yet clear whether he will be able to feature in England's last group game against Poland on 15 October.England need to win both matches at Wembley to guarantee World Cup qualification.Cole started England's last two World Cup qualifiers - a 0-0 draw with Ukraine on 10 September and a 4-0 win over Moldova four days earlier.His absence means Everton's Leighton Baines, who has won 19 caps and scored in England's 5-0 win over Moldova last year, is likely to start against Montenegro.Both of 24-year-old Gibbs's England appearances have come in friendlies.He made his international debut under previous manager Fabio Capello as a substitute in a 2-1 win against Hungary at Wembley in August 2010.Gibbs then played 72 minutes of England's 2-1 loss to France in November 2010.England are top of Group H with 16 points, one ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro.England must finish top of the group for automatic qualification for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil, while a second-placed finish would result in a two-legged play-off in November.Montenegro are expected to be without captain Mirko Vucinic, goalkeeper Mladen Bozovic, centre-back Marko Basa and midfielder Miodrag Pekovic against England because of injury.</body>

      <body>Britain's former world champion Lewis Hamilton says he fears Formula 1 fans will lose interest in the sport because Sebastian Vettel is so dominant.Vettel, 26, is on the brink of a fourth consecutive world championship after winning the Korean Grand Prix.Hamilton said he did not watch races when Michael Schumacher dominated."I remember waking up to watch the start of the race then going to sleep and waking up when it ended because I knew what would happen," said Hamilton."I am pretty sure a lot of people are doing that today."Vettel can secure the title at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday if he wins at Suzuka and rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari is lower than eighth.Fans have repeatedly booed the German as he celebrated victories on the podium, but Hamilton, who has fallen to fourth in the standings, insists the Red Bull driver deserves to win the title."He has driven well all year," said the 28-year-old. "I've just looked at his points and he has had second, first, second, first all year. He's done the perfect job and he deserves it."Vettel is 77 points clear of Alonso after winning more than half the races this season and could clinch the championship with four grands prix to go.He has won eight races, Alonso and Nico Rosberg have won two while Hamilton's only success came at the Hungarian Grand Prix.Vettel's reliability has seen him finish on the podium in two thirds of grands prix for the last four seasons but his best performance was in 2011 when he won 11 of the 19 races from 15 pole positions and only failed to make the podium on two occasions.In contrast, Hamilton has won 13 races since claiming his only world title in 2008.Vettel's record is similar to Schumacher's, who won five world titles between 2000 and 2004, winning 48 of 85 grands prix.And Red Bull team principal Christian Horner believes he deserves to be ranked alongside the greatest drivers of all time."He has to be right up there - he has to be," said Horner."The level he is performing at is unbelievable in many respects."We know Mark [Webber, Red Bull team-mate] is a very talented and quick racing driver and matching him against that, he has been hugely impressive."What has been really impressive is he has continued to grow and improve as he has gained more experience, and to have won the ratio of races he has is remarkable."</body>

      <title>Sunderland set to appoint Poyet</title>
      <description>Sunderland are set to announce ex-Brighton boss Gus Poyet as Paulo Di Canio's replacement as manager within 24 hours.</description>

      <date>1381170488</date>
      <body>Sunderland are set to appoint former Brighton boss Gus Poyet as their new manager within the next 24 hours.The Black Cats, who lie bottom of the Premier League table, sacked Paolo Di Canio on 22 September after only 13 games and six months in charge.Uruguayan Poyet is understood to have held talks with Sunderland owner Ellis Short and is close to signing a three-year deal at the Stadium of Light.Poyet, 45, was dismissed in June after four years at the Seagulls.Sunderland's senior professional development coach Kevin Ball has been in temporary charge of the club since Di Canio was relieved of his position following a player revolt at the club.Ball, 48, had asked to be considered for the job, but said following Sunderland's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday he did not expect to be doing another post-match press conference any time soon.Poyet, who has no experience of management in the top flight, made no secret of his interest in the job at the Stadium of Light, and recently said: "I planned that, over the first matches of this season, I would pay a lot of attention to the teams I thought could be in trouble."Of course, I watch Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester, but there was a group of teams who, if they didn't start well, I thought I could have a chance."I was watching Sunderland a lot. People were talking a lot about them in the summer because of Paolo and how many new players they had, so I have seen quite a lot of them."Poyet guided Brighton to the 2010-11 League One title 17 months after taking the job, and took them to last season's Championship play-off semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual winners Crystal Palace.He was suspended by Brighton in May after an internal investigation and disciplinary hearing and sacked a month later for gross misconduct.The full reasons for his sacking have not been revealed by either party, with Brighton saying the matter would stay confidential "to ensure and maintain confidentiality and dignity" after the former Chelsea midfielder's unsuccessful appeal against his dismissal.Poyet said in August he was taking legal action against Brighton over the decision to dismiss him.He is set to become the sixth Sunderland manager in the past five years - with the Black Cats currently bottom of the Premier League with one point from seven games.</body>

      <body>Seventy years ago this month, an extraordinary mass escape happened from Nazi-occupied Denmark. Tipped off about German plans to deport them to concentration camps, almost the entire Jewish population - several thousand people - fled their homes and left the country.As he stepped onto the fishing boat that was meant to carry them across the Baltic sea to safety, 14-year-old Bent Melchior feared he might never see his home again.A week earlier, he had left the home in Copenhagen he shared with his parents and four siblings. It was 8 October 1943 and Denmark was under Nazi occupation. Along with thousands of other Danish Jews, Bent and his family were fleeing the Germans."We were gathered in this boat that was supposed to carry herrings, but instead it was now carrying human beings," he says.They set off after dark. There were 19 people on the boat, hiding below deck in case German planes should spot them from overhead. The night air was chilly and the sea rough."People started to be sick, and every minute felt like an hour".Melchior and his family were part of a mass escape. That autumn night, 2,500 Jews set sail for neighbouring Sweden from Danish beaches and ports, in rowing boats, canoes, as stowaways on ferries and cargo ships. Some even swam across.In September that year, the Nazi secret police - the Gestapo - had decided to deport all Danish Jews to concentration camps, just as they'd done to millions of other Jews across Europe. The raid was scheduled for Friday 1 October, when they had hoped to find families gathering for the Jewish Sabbath dinner.But when they raided their homes, they found less than 300 people still there.A few days earlier, Georg Duckwitz, a German naval attache working at the German embassy in Copenhagen, had tipped off Hans Hedtoft, a leading member of the Danish Labour party. Hedtoft, who later became Denmark's prime minister, warned the Jewish community to leave."My parents were worried the phone might be tapped. So my mum started ringing other Jewish families, encouraging them to 'take a holiday in the countryside'," Melchior recalls."She told them we were also going away for a few days as we hadn't had a holiday that year."In 1943, Denmark was home to around 8,000 Jews. Although the country had been invaded by Germany three years earlier, the government had accepted the occupation in exchange for a measure of control over domestic affairs. Danish Jews were protected by the Danish government, whose leader collaborated with Hitler.But a determined campaign by the Danish resistance prompted Germany to take over full control of Danish affairs and the government resigned in August. The following month, Hitler ordered the deportation of all Danish Jews.As news of the imminent Nazi raid spread, Melchior's father, a rabbi at Copenhagen's main synagogue, interrupted a service celebrating Jewish New Year to urge the congregation to go into hiding and to spread the word to other Jews.The Melchior family caught a train to the island of Falster in south-eastern Denmark. The carriages were filled with German soldiers and Bent's mother and five-year-old brother Paul travelled in an empty first-class carriage in case the youngest family member unwittingly gave away where they were going.Together with 60 other Jewish refugees, Bent Melchior's father brought his wife and four youngest children into hiding at the home of a bishop. From there, they hoped to flee across the sea to neutral Sweden, which offered safety for refugees.But getting there was not easy. To even secure a place on one of the small fishing boats being used to ferry the Jews across could cost as much as £5,500 ($9,000) a head in today's money.After eight hours at sea, the boat carrying the Melchior family came close to land. Dawn was breaking and a lighthouse was clearly visible. But something was wrong. Having learnt in geography at school that Sweden was east of Denmark, Bent realised that daylight was coming from the wrong direction.In fact, the boat had sailed in a circle rather than east to the Swedish coast. The lighthouse was a Danish lighthouse and the refugees were back where they had set off. The fisherman at the helm had never sailed far from the coast and had no idea how to navigate.Sitting in the comfortable apartment in central Copenhagen he shares with his wife Lilian, surrounded by pictures of their four sons, his recollection of the escape he made 70 years ago is still crystal clear."We were afraid. My five-year-old brother had no idea what was going on. Unbeknownst to me my mother was pregnant at the time, so she had a terrible time," says Bent Melchior."If it was dangerous to be out at sea it night, it was even more dangerous in daylight. We could hear German planes overhead. If they had seen us, the Gestapo would have captured us."Eventually they started to sail east, following the sun. Miraculously, after 18 hours at sea, they reached Lilla Beddinge, a small fishing village on the Swedish coast. A six-year-old boy, Per-Arne Persson, spotted them from the beach and alerted his father, a local fisherman, who sailed out to meet the boat.Bent Melchior and his family settled down to their new life in Sweden. Bent was enrolled in a Danish school in the town of Lund, while his father got a job as a rabbi. But they were now refugees in a foreign country.Swedish was not hard for Danes to understand and the Swedish government had assured them they could stay for the duration of the war. Nevertheless, strangers would often make comments about them."People would complain that we were taking their coffee rations, or whatever was rationed at the time."As refugees we had to queue up to buy second-hand underwear, which they had decided was good enough for us."Seven decades later, Bent can still recall what it was like to be an alien abroad: "All these denigrating signs, I can still feel today," he says.Around 200 people were caught by the Germans while trying to escape and deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic. But more than 7,500 Danish Jews eventually made it across to Sweden in October 1943.They were brought out under cover. Some escape routes were organised by members of the resistance movement. But most Danish historians argue that the escape would not have been possible had it not been for thousands of ordinary Danes who helped the Jews flee.Some were "admitted" to hospitals under false names, others were hidden in churches, farms and holiday homes by the sea while they organised transport.There were of course, exceptions. Eighty Jewish refugees hiding in the loft of a church in the northern town of Gilleleje were arrested by the Gestapo after a young Danish housemaid, engaged to a German soldier, turned them in. They too, were deported to Theresienstadt.After 19 months in Sweden, the German occupation of Denmark was over. Liberation came on 4 May, 1945 and the refugees were free to return home. Melchior and his family moved back into their old apartment in Copenhagen.Life fell back into its usual rhythm, but it was never the same. His experience as a refugee galvanised Bent Melchior to a life-long involvement with refugees."We were changed people. I became very active in various movements within the Jewish community and outside."We tried to take a lesson from what had happened, to stop this terrible intolerance."He later went on to become a senior member of the Danish Refugee Council and followed his father in becoming the chief rabbi of Denmark.He has travelled the world telling his story, determined that this tale of survival should never be forgotten.Per-Arne, the six-year old Swedish boy who spotted their boat from the beach 70 years ago, is still a friend today.Bent Melchior's interview with the BBC World Service programme Witness will be broadcast at 07:50GMT on 8 October.

      <title>Ace cafe with quite a nice ancient monument attached?</title>
      <description>The new Stonehenge visitor centre will have a big cafe attached. But have attractions become all about the gift shop and cafe?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24335517</url>
      <date>1381130932</date>
      <body>English Heritage has announced that it is building a £27m visitor centre at Stonehenge, with what looks like a very large eating area. Is the cafe and gift shop almost as important as the attraction itself these days?Almost 50% of the shiny new visitor centre at Stonehenge will be taken up with a new "bright and spacious" cafe for up to 260 people and a bigger shop.It almost harks back to a memorable ad campaign by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1988, the museum commissioned a poster with the slogan: "Where else do they give you £100,000,000 worth of objets d'art free with every egg salad?"The poster was one of six, all describing the VandA as: "An ace caff, with quite a nice museum attached."It's a premise that won't surprise anyone who has visited a stately home or garden run by the National Trust recently. Some 19.2 million people made a trip last year. Many of those will have dutifully queued for a flapjack and a cup of tea. Or even a substantial meal.Food writer Giles Coren recalls visiting London Zoo as a child and caring more about the gift shop than the animals: "Thousands of school children, coachloads of them have to visit these places, and all they care about is the shop."He associates past visits to stately homes with rock-hard scones but thinks for many people it's increasingly all about the food. "It's like the Colosseum in Rome, people go all that way to see it only to discover it's a lot of boring old stones, but at least you can get an excellent pizza."Visitors now demand a nice place to eat, having put up with poor facilities for far too long, Coren suggests. "Everything in Britain has been rubbish for years and people won't put up with it anymore."There is scepticism among some about the new generation of visitor centres.TripAdvisor is full of reviews from people who are unimpressed. One reviewer was very upset when changes were made at a cathedral in East Anglia. "I love this cathedral, have been taking visitors to it for over 20 years… but it was so much nicer when you could walk in at the front. Now you have to go through a new visitors' centre, which adds nothing to your experience of visiting the cathedral, but does direct you past a desk for collecting your 'optional' entrance fee."Another visitor to a major modern art museum in London recalled: "We ordered their vegetable soup - a small bowl with watery soup containing some vegetables and a small hard roll (and we had to ask for some butter!) - 6.50 each! For us that's a rip-off and we were not impressed."But generally the trend is for the cafes in museums, galleries and castles to get better and better. And those in the heritage business see them as a happy synergy."A good shop and cafe greatly enhance the overall experience," says Matthew Tanner, chairman of the Association of Independent Museums. "No visit is complete without an interesting shop, a fine cup of tea, and not forgetting a good loo too."The argument for spending money on an extensive cafe is twofold - visitors have come to expect them, and the revenue raised helps subsidise the attraction.One place where this takes place is RHS Wisley in Surrey where the gift shop and cafe are the gatekeepers to the gardens people come to see. Nigel Eaton manages the shop and says it is part of the whole experience."We've got three kinds of customers - we have the RHS members who visit on a regular basis, the gardeners who come just for the plants and then we've got what we call the payers, who come on coaches for a nice day out. Every penny that is spent in the shop goes back into the RHS, so the shop is very important to us."Some 1.1 million people visit Wisley every year. The results of a customer survey revealed that 22% of those visitors came just for the "retail experience". Last year the shop - including one of the world's biggest gardening bookshops - made £3.8m and they expect to make an even bigger profit this year.As a Lonely Planet author, David Else has visited a lot of tourist attractions and has no problem with visitor centres. In fact he rather likes them."In the case of Stonehenge, a good visitor centre is going to tell you so much more about the history of what is essentially a group of old stones. I've got no problem with cafes, either - I like a good cup of tea after a visit and don't mind if they want to make a few bob to help preserve the site."In the heritage and art business it's all about making attractions "sustainable".Getting the shop and cafe right at an attraction is a win-win situation, says Jane Temperley from the Association for Cultural Enterprises. "Sure it is about generating income - everyone is looking at how to make their sites more sustainable. But research says visitors enjoy cafes and shops, happy visitors spend more and tend to become repeat visitors or members, which generates more income."About 80% of visitors to Wisley are RHS members so they come back to visit time and time again. Thirty-two staff work in the Wisley Shop and 60 staff work in the cafes and restaurants - that's over 25% of the total site staff of 350.And the staff at attraction are at pains to point out that the food has got better and better. Laurent Trenga is the chef responsible for the planning of menus at Wisley. He points out that a burger and chips at Wisley is no ordinary burger and chips. "Our burger is made from locally sourced quality pork and apples grown in our own orchards, even the bun is made fresh on site."The plants are rather nice too.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Lib Dems defend Baker appointment</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems defend Norman Baker's appointment as a Home Office minister, saying his views on the death of Dr David Kelly in 2003 are irrelevant to the job.</description>

      <body>The Lib Dems have defended Norman Baker's appointment as a Home Office minister, saying his views on the death of government scientist David Kelly in 2003 are irrelevant to the job.As a backbench MP, Mr Baker claimed Mr Kelly was murdered and this may have be en hushed up by the UK authorities.Home Secretary Theresa May is reported to be unhappy with his appointment.But Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said Mr Baker had been an "enormously effective" minister since 2010.Mr Baker's promotion from the Department of Transport, where he had been a minister for the past three years, to the Home Office, was a surprise feature of Monday's government reshuffle.He has replaced Jeremy Browne, previously regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies.In his new role as minister of state for crime prevention, Mr Baker will be responsible for policy on drugs, organised and violent crime and anti-social behaviour.In a 2006 book titled 'The Strange Death of David Kelly', Mr Baker claimed Dr Kelly had been killed by Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein and his murder may have been passed off as suicide by the British security services for "reasons of political expediency".The government weapons expert was found dead in an Oxfordshire wood after he was named as the source of claims about Iraq's weapons capability which triggered a furious row between the then Labour government and the BBC.Mr Baker spent six months investigating the circumstances of Dr Kelly's death, stepping down from his frontbench role at the time. He has maintained his calls for a fresh public inquiry.The 2004 Hutton Inquiry concluded that Dr Kelly committed suicide.A formal inquest has never been held but Attorney General Dominic Grieve has rejected calls for the case to be reopened, saying the evidence about the causes of death was "overwhelming".Mr Alexander, one of the most senior Lib Dems in government, said his colleague's views on the death of Dr Kelly were "well explained" and he personally did not agree with them.But he added: "It is an excellent appointment. As we enter the last third of this government, there are a whole range of areas that we, as Liberal Democrats, need to sharpen our campaigning edge."Home Office issues is one of those things... Norman has been an enormously effective minister in the Department for Transport, he has done a great job for the government and the Lib Dems and he deserves this opportunity."Mr Alexander told Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Baker had had access to "all sorts of information" at the Department of Transport and proved himself to be reliable."He will be a great Home Office minister, with a great track record on civil liberties issues and standing up for the rights of people in this country and that is precisely what the Lib Dems need in the Home Office," he added.One Lib Dem activist said Mr Baker's appointment was specifically designed to "annoy" the home secretary.The Lib Dem Voice website - which is read by party activists - quoted a source close to the party leadership as suggesting Mr Browne had failed to leave a "liberal imprint" during his time at the Home Office.Stephen Tall, the website's co-editor, said Mr Baker's appointment could also be explained by the party's "sluggish" response to the "Go Home Vans row" where billboards were driven around parts of the UK warning illegal immigrants to either leave the country voluntarily or face arrest.The Lib Dems claimed they were not consulted about the policy, with Mr Browne saying he was away at the time."It's not that Nick Clegg expects Norman Baker to get more of an inside track on the Home Office than Jeremy Browne did, and be able to prevent Theresa May's authoritarian knee-jerk," Mr Tall added."But he can rely on him to project a liberal message when the leader's away."It's hard to see Norman's (appointment) as anything but a calculated move to seriously annoy the Home Office, and put clear yellow water between us and the Tories."</body>

      <title>Moore sacked in government reshuffle</title>
      <description>Alistair Carmichael replaces Michael Moore as Scottish Secretary as other ministerial changes are announced and Labour carries out its own reshuffle.</description>

      <body>Michael Moore has been replaced by Alistair Carmichael as secretary of state for Scotland in a wide-ranging reshuffle of Conservative and Lib Dem ministers in the coalition government.Mr Moore said he was "disappointed" but would continue to back the UK ahead of next year's independence referendum.Ex-journalist Esther McVey is among several female Tory MPs to be promoted as David Cameron freshened up his team.Ed Miliband has also carried out a major shake-up of Labour's frontbench.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg has been replaced by historian Tristram Hunt while Jim Murphy, another senior figure regarded as being on the right of the party, is moved from defence to international development.But Andy Burnham is to stay as shadow health secretary.Mr Moore was the only cabinet minister to lose his job in Monday's coalition reshuffle, which has largely focused on middle-ranking and junior ministerial positions.In other notable government changes:Reacting to his sacking, Mr Moore said the future of the UK was "bigger than one individual or party" and he believed those wanting Scotland to remain as part of the union were "winning the argument".Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition.He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman.The BBC's chief political correspondent, Norman Smith, said the move could be explained by David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's desire to have a more combative figure in the job to take the fight to SNP leader Alex Salmond.Announcing the change, Mr Clegg said Mr Moore had done a "formidable" job but that he believed "we now need to draw on different experience in the final year running up to the referendum itself".News on the ministerial reshuffle was broken via the No 10 Twitter site.Five women MPs have joined the government while three have been promoted.Former broadcaster Esther McVey has been elevated from her role as junior disabilities minister in the Department of Work and Pensions to minister of state, with responsibility for employment.Nicky Morgan, previously a government whip, joins the Treasury as economic secretary while Justice minister Helen Grant moves to the Department for Culture, taking on responsibility for sport and tourism as well as equalities.Anna Soubry moves from health to defence while Jane Ellison takes her role as public health minister. Claire Perry and Amber Rudd have joined the government as whips while current whip Karen Bradley is promoted.Also on the rise is Matt Hancock, a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, who stays within the Department for Business but with a wider brief encompassing skills and enterprise.And fresh faces in the government include George Eustice, David Cameron's former press secretary, at environment, Shailesh Vera at justice and Kris Hopkins at local government.Among those being axed include Housing minister Mark Prisk, Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon and Treasury Minister Mark Hoban, who tweeted that it was not his "finest day".Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said the government's reshuffle was "designed to support hardworking people" and he accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of "purging moderates" in his party.Lib Dem Jeremy Browne, previously regarded as a close ally of Nick Clegg, was a surprising casualty after he was replaced at the Home Office by Norman Baker.Writing to Mr Browne, Mr Clegg said: "It is always very difficult to move colleagues out of government but as you know, I have always been keen that we provide the opportunity for as many in our ranks as possible to contribute their skills to ministerial office during this Parliament."Lib Dem peer Baroness Kramer, who lost her seat at the 2010 election, becomes a transport minister while Stephen Williams and Dan Rogerson get junior ministerial jobs at local government and environment respectively.A number of Conservative ministers resigned from the government over the weekend in anticipation of the reshuffle, with Mr Cameron looking to reshape his lower and middle ranks.</body>

      <title>Reeves promoted in Labour reshuffle</title>
      <description>Rachel Reeves replaces Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.</description>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The three new members of the shadow cabinet, Rachel Reeves, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <title>Is the British weather unique in the world?</title>
      <description>Is the British weather genuinely unique in the world?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24305230</url>
      <date>1381198849</date>
      <body>It's often said by laymen that the UK's weather is unique. But what makes it so different from anywhere else?Whatever you think of the British weather, if you don't like it one day there's always a good chance you might like it the next.Weather, in meteorological terms, refers to the daily elements like temperature, wind and rain. And in Britain they can all change hour by hour and day by day.It's this diversity and changeability that makes British weather so distinct, say meteorologists. While temperatures are fairly mild and there are four distinct seasons, you can also get warm weather in the middle of February and freezing rain in the middle of August - or both in one day."Other countries might have more dramatic weather," says Dr Liz Bentley, head of the Weather Club at the Royal Meteorological Society. "In India and Pakistan you get monsoon season, but you can usually predict the day it will start and the day it will finish."In the UK you sometimes have to look at the weather forecast several times in one morning just to plan a trip out that afternoon. Things can change that quickly."Many meteorologists call the British weather unique, although some say you could argue the weather in all countries is unique because no two are the same geographically and geologically. But they agree it is hard to find another country in the world with weather that compares to the UK.So what makes it so distinctly variable?"Britain's unique weather is all down to the fact it is an island and where it's positioned on the planet, between the Atlantic Ocean and a large land mass, continental Europe," says Helen Chivers from the Met Office. "There is a lot going on meteorologically where we are."Britain is under an area where five main air masses meet. An air mass is a large body of air that has similar temperature and moisture properties throughout.In the UK they are either polar or tropical, depending on where the air mass originated; they are also divided into maritime or continental, depending on whether the air has passed over land or sea.They come from all directions and can bring all types of weather.When they meet it creates a weather front. The air masses fight it out and the one that wins dictates the weather. There is a sixth air mass, the returning Polar Maritime, which is a variation of the Polar Maritime.One more important thing to throw into the mix is the jet stream. It is a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air that drives all weather in the UK's latitude around the northern hemisphere. It is responsible for developing weather systems.All in all, it's quite a mix of atmospheric conditions battling it out."It's what makes the British weather so fascinating," says Bentley. "Experiencing such big changes so quickly is unique."Fascinating or frustrating, the layman might argue, but no other country in the world gets the same weather, say experts."Japan is probably the only other place that has similarities to the UK when it comes to weather," says Chivers."It is similar to us but in reverse. It is an island and has the Pacific Ocean to the east and Eurasian continent to the west. Britain's variations in weather really are that rare."These variations pose problems, from when to have a barbecue to effective planning for businesses. Companies spend millions trying not to be caught out by the British weather."From energy companies, supermarkets and insurance firms to banks, technology companies and local authorities, they all need to plan for the weather," says Richard Tipper, director of Ecometrica, which works with companies to get the climate and weather data they need to plan efficiently."It's the amazing changeability in British weather that is unique. It also means planning for it isn't always easy."Subtle changes in the weather are happening and will continue, says Bentley."We are starting to see more record-breaking weather, record droughts and record rainfall," she says.Last year is a good example. The dramatic switch from drought in early 2012 to the wettest April to June on record was of a magnitude never seen before, according to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).Hosepipe bans were brought in early in the year but by early autumn levels of groundwater were "well above" average.But the country's fascination with the weather probably won't change. Nor will some people's love for it."There is a real beauty about the weather in the UK," says Bentley."You might be guaranteed sun in other countries but constant sunshine can get dull. People move to other countries but often they end up missing the British weather and the seasons."There are also some real upsides. When we get unexpected sunshine in the UK everyone's day is better. It just feels like we are getting a special treat and we are so much happier."The Great British Year is on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 9 October or catch up with iPlayer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24438875</url>
      <date>1381180644</date>
      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>'Do I still not like that': Graham Taylor's lowest point</title>
      <description>Graham Taylor recalls low point of his spell as England manager</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24354888</url>
      <date>1381186810</date>
      <body>"If you say 'Holland' to me, to this day I see David Platt running through on goal. I can't help it. When things don't go well as an England manager, it sticks with you for the rest of your life."Wednesday, 13 October, 1993 is a date lodged firmly in the mind of former England manager Graham Taylor.Three years into the job, three years after Bobby Robson, Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker had captured the nation's hearts by reaching the semi-finals of Italia 90, the unthinkable happened.A controversial defeat by the Netherlands in Rotterdam, with Ronald Koeman scoring the opener minutes after he should have been dismissed for a professional foul, effectively ended England's chances of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.Taylor was left feeling "cheated".Thanks to a warts-and-all documentary broadcast on Channel 4 a year later, images of Taylor's touchline fury and exasperation remain etched in England fans' collective memory.After a poor Euro 92 which saw England eliminated in the group stages after scoring just once in three games, Taylor's maiden World Cup campaign got off to a bad start.Leads at home to Norway and then the Netherlands were painfully squandered, putting qualification in doubt."We played very well in both of those games and if we had won just one, which we deserved to, we would have been OK," Taylor remembers.But the away double-header in May and June of 1993 did not go well either.A draw in Poland and defeat away against leaders Norway in the space of four days left Taylor's side up against it. However, after an impressive 3-0 win over Poland at Wembley, England's fate was in their own hands going into the penultimate fixture in Rotterdam."We were a point above the Netherlands, with two games to go," says Taylor. "A draw would have been enough for us to qualify and we were as confident as we could expect to be."With captain Stuart Pearce injured and Lazio midfielder Paul Gascoigne suspended, Taylor made five changes to his side.Off the pitch, he was called on to help smuggle in the documentary crew after they were denied access by the Dutch FA. The crew donned England tracksuits and carried their film equipment into the stadium in team kitbags.Once the match kicked off, Leeds full-back Tony Dorigo - standing in for Pearce - smashed a long-range free-kick against the post, while Frank Rijkaard had an effort for the hosts disallowed in a goalless first half.So far, so good.The match, England's hopes and Taylor's career were all transformed by a two-minute spell around the hour mark. Andy Sinton - on at half-time in place of Carlton Palmer - hit a long ball over the top for David Platt to run on to.The England skipper was hauled to the ground by Koeman, but referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher decided to only show the Barcelona man a yellow card, rather than red.The documentary was to show Taylor imploring the German official to send Koeman off, memorably asking fourth official Markus Merk: "What sort of thing is happening here?"Even 20 years on, Taylor is incensed by the decision."I could not believe what I was seeing. It was a goalscoring opportunity and Koeman should have gone," he says. "Fifa had made a very strong point in the weeks before the game that the denial of a goalscoring opportunity was a straight red card."He should have been sent off, absolutely."After the game, Koeman admitted he had expected to be dismissed. Instead, Dorigo's free-kick was blocked by the advancing Dutch wall and two minutes later the home side were given a free-kick at the other end.To heighten England's sense of injustice, it was Koeman who stepped up to score. His first effort was charged down by Ince, but he made no mistake second time around, with ITV commentator Brian Moore's prophecy of "he's going to flick one, he's going to flick one" proving accurate as he curled the ball into the top corner."That was when I lost it," Taylor says. "I honestly felt that we were being cheated. The referee was favouring the home side, I really felt that, as the free-kick we had blocked was exactly the same."The only other occasion in my career I felt like that was when I was in charge of Lincoln and we had a terrible penalty awarded at Birmingham. But this was obviously worse."I lost the plot because I honestly and truthfully felt that England were being cheated in a vital game for the country."That was the worst I've ever been on a touchline. I'd never been like that before. But that is the one time I end up on film, so that's what people remember."Paul Merson hit the post again but a second goal for the Netherlands followed, with Dennis Bergkamp scoring."The referee's got me the sack," Taylor told the linesman in the closing minutes. "Thank him ever so much for that won't you?"Taylor concluded his reign with a futile 7-1 win in San Marino in November 1993, as the Netherlands secured qualification by beating Poland. Taylor resigned six days later."I try not to think about what would have happened next if Koeman had been sent off," Taylor says. "I'm sure we would have qualified for the World Cup and I probably keep my job. But that's life."Film-maker Ken McGill and his team had been recording Taylor and his team throughout the qualifiers. Taylor had agreed to take part in the programme as he hoped it would show the differences between club and international management.But as results turned for the worse, the focus shifted to Taylor himself - the man in the 'Impossible Job', the title of the film which more than six million people tuned in to watch."I didn't ever expect that we wouldn't qualify, I was arrogant enough to think that," admits Taylor."So I was keen to show the problems of being England manager. Then, as the results went on and we didn't qualify, I became more central to the documentary, quite rightly."You're the country's number one villain."Taylor thought about cancelling filming before the trip to Norway in June 1993, but knew that the written press - who were already hostile towards him - would seize on it as an admission England would not qualify."One positive which came out of it is that people saw I was passionate about the job," Taylor says. "But I can't watch it. I put a little bit of the documentary on my computer recently but I couldn't watch it."I said to myself 'don't watch it Graham, because for the next week you'll be down'."In the aftermath of his resignation - and being labelled a 'turnip' by the Sun newspaper in 1992 - Taylor considered leaving the country. Instead he stayed and rebuilt his club career, taking Watford back to the top flight.The documentary was a hit. But McGill, who has also made films with Gascoigne, Lennox Lewis and Ian Botham,  has mixed feelings 20 years on.Taylor may have been able to return to work, but his assistant Phil Neal was criticised for being 'a yes man' after the documentary was broadcast. At the time, he was England's most decorated player, yet his managerial career never recovered, with a brief spell in charge of Manchester City in 1996 his last job as a coach."At the time I felt terrible," McGill admits, "not only for Graham but I also feel responsible for Phil not being able to earn a living in football any more."If it wasn't for Graham's help, we would not have been able to film in Rotterdam. We would have missed all of that drama."I found it hard to take the consequences of the film. But there is nothing I would change. It is a piece of honest film-making."</body>

      <title>Can a fiver save the high street?</title>
      <description>Can just £5 a week help save your high street?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-24374320</url>

      <body>Online shopping and competition from out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets have long been cited as the reason so many British high streets are suffering. But can a project which challenges consumers to spend £5 locally finally turn the tide?A number of government schemes have been introduced to try and give shopping areas a boost, but what can towns do to help themselves?Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent is the latest to try out a scheme to get local people to spend £5 of their weekly shopping budget in their town centre instead of online or in chain stores.It currently has about 30 empty shops and has suffered since the closure of the Royal Doulton factory in 2005 and tourist attraction Ceramica shutting down in 2011.It is also two miles from Hanley which is seen as the retail centre for Stoke-on-Trent.Professor Jon Fairburn, from Staffordshire University's Business School, is helping to implement the social enterprise scheme called Totally Locally."The theory is if every adult living within one mile of Burslem town centre spends £5 with their local independent shops and businesses, it would be worth an extra £6m a year to the local economy," he said.But how realistic is that figure?Matthew Hopkinson, who is the director of the Local Data Company, which analyses retail trends, claims the scheme is "a gimmick."He said: "What you're trying to do is change consumer behaviour but even if they do it for one week they're probably not going to do it for 52 weeks a year."Businesses think if they can manipulate the consumer and their habits everything will be alright, but ultimately it can't be sustained."One town to already try the idea is the market town of Leek in the Staffordshire Moorlands.Three years ago it had a vacancy rate of 11% (about 30 shops) and charity shops occupied a number of units. That vacancy rate is now down to 6% (about 11 shops).Marc Briand, who leads the scheme, said it was set up as a reaction to the building of a new supermarket in the town in 2011."Switching £5 of your shopping budget is as simple as buying a sandwich from the local cafe at lunch or buying your weekly fruit and veg," he said."Out of that people then start to think about getting their car serviced at the local garage or buying clothes from local boutiques."The initial idea of making sure people spend that fiver has started to tail away but we've built on that to market the town in the right way and people keep coming back."Pop into Alison Szafranski's Market Kitchen Cafe in Stanley Street and she will point you in the right direction to buy a birthday gift or bottle of wine for a dinner party."It's about promoting all the businesses here, competition is healthy, but we are all about pulling together to make our businesses successful and Leek successful," she said.Mr Briand said it was "difficult to gauge" how successful the £5 spend scheme had been."Traders are quite cagey about what their profits are but shop keepers I know saw a definite upturn [in profits]," he said."Even taking it from a low vacancy rate...you can't say it hasn't had an affect."Traders in the smaller town of Eccleshall started the £5 spend scheme in January.Accountant Tim Hulse, who leads the project, said it was about bringing traders together rather than revitalising the high street."Eccleshall has always been a reasonably prosperous area because we've got a lot of so-called destination shops; a baby boutique, a speciality wedding shop, jewellers, and those bring people in," he said."I think it's the case of bringing a group of people together to put the effort in to promote any sort of campaign. Some traders have reported a 10 to 20% rise in turnover since we began."At WM Perry butchers on Stafford Street there are a stack of bones piled on a table outside for dog owners to take and a list of nearby farms where the shop's meat comes from.Owner Peter Bevan said: "I don't think you can dictate to someone how and where they spend their money but the important thing is we give them the service that keeps them coming back."I think that's what Eccleshall prides itself on, shopkeepers now know the customers names and faces and know exactly what they want."But the scheme would not suit all town centres, according to Mr Hulse.He said: "We're a small enough town not to need a massive major brand name and I think with the unique businesses we have, proximity drives footfall."It will be interesting to see how Burslem does, being so close to Stoke-on-Trent city centre and what it has to offer retail wise."Back in Burslem, some shops are getting a fresh coat of paint ahead of the launch of the £5 scheme on 12 October.Only time will tell if shoppers spending a weekly fiver will spark the town's revival.</body>

      <title>Looking into Scotland's black history</title>
      <description>Scotland's long and intriguing black history</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24347632</url>
      <date>1381191204</date>
      <body>October is Black History Month, an event first marked in the UK 25 years ago. Scotland has close associations with the black African and Caribbean communities it celebrates.Black History Month has been held annually in the US since the 1920s and in the UK from the late 80s.It is a celebration of the contribution that black African and Caribbean communities have made on a local level and across the world.Hackney, London, is where it all started in British terms and the London borough is holding various events to mark the 25th anniversary.Scotland's black history is populated by interesting and important characters, many of whom had to endure prejudice and racism. But who were some of these people?On the bottom of in Eddrachillis Bay near Drumbeg, in Sutherland, lie three cannon and part of a wooden hull of an age-old ship.Archaeologists believe it could be the remains of a Dutch vessel that got into difficulty off Scotland's remote north-west Highland coast between 1650 and 1750.One theory is that the vessel was owned by the Dutch East India Company, also known as VOC.Founded in 1602, it was the world's biggest and most powerful trading company until it collapsed in financial ruin in 1799.Its vessels regularly sailed around the north of Scotland because of the favourable winds and also to avoid the English Channel, particularly at times of war and tensions in Europe.The cannon could have been used by the Drumbeg ship's crew to ward off privateers, privately-owned armed vessels commissioned by a state to attack an enemy's shipping.And it has been suggested some or all of the crew may have survived their ordeal.There is possible evidence of foreign sailors setting up home in the north of Scotland after their vessel foundered off the Sutherland coast.The First Statistical Account of Scotland published between 1791 and 1799 records how the climate of the area was pleasant enough for "natives of the East and West Indies" to live there.Philip Robertson, a Historic Scotland marine archaeologist, told BBC Scotland in March that the origins of the Drumbeg crew, and their fate, was still unknown.But he added: "The wreck gives us a unique window into our history and, interestingly, the trading activity off the Scottish coastline and across the world."Scots were heavily involved in the slave trade of the 18th and 19th Centuries, something which leading historian Prof Tom Devine has accused Scotland of ignoring today.Men and women were put to work in Scots-run plantations in the colonies. Female slaves were also sexually abused by their owners.An exhibition on slavery held in 2011 involving the Centre for History in Dornoch and Edinburgh Beltane organisation featured correspondence detailing the keeping of sex slaves.The letters were sent by Highland owners to relatives in Inverness and their contents were described as "graphic" and "disturbing" by researchers.Scotland's slave past is also recorded in other sources.In 2007, historians were intrigued by a mysterious black figure who appears in a tapestry depicting the Battle of Culloden of 16 April 1746.Some at experts at the National Trust for Scotland had a theory that he may be a Jamaican servant of an officer on the government side.Little is known of the 18th Century needlework, and the trust said it was not clear if the tapestry was a true depiction of a scene from the battle, or one featuring later influences.Papers in the JLM Mitchell Archive of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, meanwhile, include a Scottish soldier's request to take his daughter Mary's black slave with him to war in 1782.Lt Soirle MacDonald, from Skye, was a British Army officer in the American War of Independence.His daughter's slave was called Doll. She was likely to have been made to do domestic duties.Records detailing compensation paid by the British government to slave owners after slavery was abolished mention Gen Sir James Duff, an army officer and MP for Banffshire.He was awarded £4,101, more than £3m in today's money, to compensate him for the 202 slaves he was forced by law to give up on the Grange Sugar Estate in Jamaica.David Alston, a local historian and Highland councillor, has also examined slavery.He was drawn to the subject after discovering that fossil hunter, geologist and writer Hugh Miller sat next to a black pupil in the school he attended in Cromarty.Dr Alston said: "I gradually noticed more and more local connections with the Caribbean, including references on gravestones."Slowly it became clear just how many Highland Scots had connections to slave-worked plantations and how many children were born to these Highlanders and either enslaved or 'free coloured' women."Further research led Dr Alston to find that almost every prominent school in the Highlands had black pupils on its roll at some time between 1790 and 1830.He said: "I keep my research very focussed on the three former Dutch colonies which later became British Guiana, now Guyana, on the north coast of South America."Almost everyone will recognise the name of one of the colonies - Demerara."I have now identified almost 450 people with Highland connections involved in the plantation of Guyana before emancipation of slaves in 1834."But Scots also fought against slavery.They served in the Union army in the American Civil War of 1861-65. Slavery was among issues that divided American society at the time, and led to a violent conflict.Lt Col William L Duff, Sgt Maj John McEwan, Robert Steedman, James Wilkie, Robert Ferguson and Alexander Smith are listed on a civil war memorial in Edinburgh.Other Scots who fought for the Union included Glasgow-born John McTammany, who served in the 115th Ohio volunteers.Another was George Henry Mackenzie, who was born 175 years ago in North Kessock, a small community across the Beauly Firth from Inverness.As a captain, he led Black Union soldiers.Football was where two key figures in Scotland's black history excelled in the face of extreme prejudice in the late 1800s.Carrie Boustead played in goals for a number of teams including Mrs Graham's XI, a women's team set up by Helen Matthew, the daughter of a Montrose-born master mariner.Richard McBrearty, of the Scottish Football Museum, said: "A degree of mystery surrounds Carrie Boustead."It is believed that Carrie Boustead was originally known as Clara Berry and was raised in Liverpool during the 1870s."Carrie first comes to prominence in 1896 when she played in a series of football matches north and south of the border."Boustead was in goals for a London team that played at Barrowfield Park in Glasgow in May 1896, and also in a game held in Stirling.She was listed as being goalkeeper for Mrs Graham's XI in a match played at Wishaw in Lanarkshire.Boustead is among women footballers of the 1800s portrayed in paintings by Scots artist Stuart Gibbs.Mr McBrearty said: "At a time when there was widespread cynicism towards women playing football, Boustead was a successful proponent of the women's game and she, along with her team mates of the period, should be remembered for their achievements north and south of the border as pioneers."While much of Boustead's life is a mystery, the career of Andrew Watson, Scotland's first black international footballer, is well documented.Mr Brearty said: "Watson was one of the greatest defenders of his generation."He played in three of the greatest and most high profile teams of the 1880s - Queen's Park FC, Corinthians, and Scotland."Watson, who was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, and whose father was a plantation manager and former slave owner from Orkney, played for Scotland at a time when they dominated international football.His three caps for Scotland were a 6-1 and 5-1 win over England and a 5-1 win over Wales.Mr Brearty said: "On his debut in 1881 he captained Scotland to a 6-1 win over England at the Oval in London - this remains England's heaviest defeat on home soil."He added: "Watson only won three caps because he moved away from Scotland and down to London in 1882 and was beyond the gaze of the international selectors."While in London in 1882 he played for the London Swifts in an FA Cup match and became the first known black footballer to play in the FA Cup."He is the first black international footballer and international football captain."England's Corinthians included a few non-English players. Watson was the first of those footballers and he played in the team's 8-1 win over reigning FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in 1884.But Watson's star qualities on the pitch did not protect him from racial abuse.Mr McBrearty said: "The Scottish Athletic Journal provided an overview of his career in 1885."It stated: 'Although on more than one occasion subjected to vulgar insults by splenetic, ill-tempered players, he uniformly preserved that gentlemanly demeanour which has endeared him to opponents as well as his club companions'."This suggests that he experienced racism on the field, but that he was able to rise above insults and let his sporting ability shine through on the park."But he added: "One of the best complements to Watson's ability can be found in his selection in an all-star Scotland team in 1926. JAH Catton, editor of the Athletic News, selected Watson at left back in his all-time Scotland team, 44 years after his last Scotland appearance."Eugene Bullard - America's first black combat pilot - must rate among one of the most unusual characters from Scotland's black history.Georgia-born Bullard's ancestors included slaves from Martinique who were brought to America by their French owners as they fled the Haitian slave revolution.His father spoke French and also talked fondly of France, instilling in Bullard a belief that it was the true land of opportunity, free of prejudice.Spurred by an attempt to lynch his father and his own brushes with racial hatred, Bullard worked towards getting himself to Paris. This journey first took him to Scotland.According to Craig Lloyd's book Eugene Bullard: Black Expatriate in Jazz-Age Paris, Bullard was barely in his teens when he stowed away on a German cargo ship at Norfolk, Virginia.The captain of the Marta Russ first threatened to throw Bullard overboard, before giving him the chance of working on the ship on its passage to Aberdeen.Bullard left his ship shortly after it reached Aberdeen. He spent a day in the Granite City before taking a train to Glasgow.While he was relieved to find he was not the target of vicious racial abuse in Scotland, Lloyd said that Bullard did have one immediate problem.Lloyd wrote: "At first he had difficulty with the Scottish dialect and accent: 'the language the natives spoke was sort of like English'."Bullard spent five months in Glasgow and earned money acting as a lookout at illegal gambling dens.He later headed for Liverpool and then finally France.In World War I, he served with the French Foreign Legion and saw action at some of the bloodiest battles, including the Somme and Artois Ridge.Wounds he suffered at Verdun ruled him out from returning to the front line as a soldier, but he was offered a chance to become a pilot with the French Flying Corps.In 1917, he qualified as a flyer. He earned one officially confirmed kill.When the US entered the war, Bullard sought a transfer to its air force. His request was ignored.Bullard remained in Paris after the war.He became part-owner of a night club, got married and had three children.During World War II, he fought with the French resistance until he was badly wounded and was smuggled into Spain.Thirty-three years after his death in 1961 the US Air Force posthumously commissioned him as a lieutenant in honour of his war-time exploits.</body>

      <title>Analysis: Axe over council budgets</title>
      <description>Preview of the Welsh Government draft budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24432008</url>
      <date>1381169538</date>
      <body>With the Welsh government set to publish its draft budget for 2014-15 on Tuesday, BBC News examines the prospects for public services in the coming year.Austerity has been with us since the turn of the decade - but these really are the hard yards now for those charged with balancing the nation's books.The kind of simpler savings sometimes characterised as "low hanging fruit" are largely gone.There's a noticeable change of tone from ministers in recent months, and a realisation that the cuts will just keep coming, to 2017 and probably beyond.So what can we expect from Tuesday's draft budget? As always, the spending on the Welsh NHS will be under microscopic scrutiny.It's faced "cash flat" budget settlements in recent years, meaning that inflation has eroded actual spending power year on year. After a summer of dismal headlines and missed targets, the feeling is that something has had to give and that extra money may be found.But at what cost? Here is a breakdown of the Welsh government's spending by department:So the vast majority of Welsh government spending is split between two departments - health and local government, with health by a margin the largest.Any substantial increase in health spending is going to to have serious knock on impact elsewhere - and it's local government which is bracing itself for Tuesday's announcement.The deeper cuts in council budgets were signalled in a speech by Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths to the Welsh Local Government Association annual conference in June this year, where she said that the relative protection Welsh councils had enjoyed compared to their English counterparts since austerity began can no longer be sustained.It means much tougher decisions in town halls up and down Wales from here on in - and since councils have been told to protect spending on schools and social care (their biggest ticket items) the axe will fall on areas such as leisure, highways and cultural services in a way not experienced by people so far.What are the prospects for the Welsh government to get its own tough decisions on spending through the National Assembly this time round?Without an overall majority, they've needed to do deals with other parties so far to get their budgets through.This year, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have joined forces to negotiate together, and with Carwyn Jones ruling out any deal with the Conservatives on principle, it's meant that his options have been significantly limited.In previous years, negotiations have dragged on for weeks after the draft budget has been published. But - whisper it quietly - there appears to have been an outbreak of political maturity in Cardiff Bay.Following what are reported as constructive discussions ongoing through the summer, we could see a comprehensive deal announced as early as today between Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.But getting the votes to pass the budget will be the easy part.Making sure the health service makes the most of any extra cash and supporting local government through the knock on impacts of what are likely to be the deepest cuts in most councillors' political lifetimes will be a far bigger struggle.</body>

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <description>Papers react to party leaders' reshuffles</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24440153</url>
      <date>1381208246</date>
      <body>The papers have plenty to say about reshuffles carried out by all three main political party leaders.The Guardian reports that Home Secretary Theresa May was said to be "spitting tacks" after Nick Clegg imposed Liberal Democrat Norman Baker on her department.The paper says Mrs May was not consulted about his appointment.For his part, Mr Baker tells the Independent he wants to make the Home Office "more liberal" and ensure "the rights of individuals are protected".The Daily Telegraph says there was a "far greater significance to yesterday's manoeuvrings" than is usually the case, particularly in the Labour camp.The paper's editorial maintains that Ed Miliband's purge of remaining Blairites, coupled with the demotion of more centrist colleagues, provides further evidence that Labour is now "an out-and-out party of the left".According to The Daily Express, the Labour leader has shown his "deepest red" colours by penalising those urging moderation.On the other hand, the paper insists David Cameron has taken on board voter concerns over a front bench of privilege by elevating a new breed of state-educated Tory.The Times leads with the news that tens of thousands of parents face "stiff" fines because they have failed to meet the deadline for registering their child benefit payments on their tax returns.The paper says 165,000 higher earning parents, who have carried on receiving payments, did not register for self assessment by the weekend.Amid the deadline for people to apply for Royal Mail shares, the Daily Telegraph says millions of small investors are set to profit from the sale.The paper likens "a late rush" for shares to the interest shown by investors in the privatisation of British Gas and other industries in the 1980s.The Guardian says it understands ministers may raise the share allocation for small investors at the expense of banks because of a growing outcry over the original percentage of shares available to the public.The Financial Times reports that some brokers are extending their opening hours to deal with an expected last-minute scramble for applications.The Guardian carries a claim from scientists that the controversial cull of badgers in England "could now spread TB" because not enough of the animals have been killed.The paper says sources have told it that not even half the number of badgers needed to help curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle have been culled.Some 70% is said to be the minimum kill rate for a cull to be deemed a success.Paul Caruana, who used to work for Defra and has been involved in the latter stages of the cull, tells the paper that organisers hit the "panic button" when they realised the night shoots were not getting the expected results.Meanwhile, cat lovers you have been warned. A purring cat might not be as happy as it sounds, according the Daily Telegraph.Scientists at the University of Lincoln have found that cats release hormones linked to stress when they are constantly petted.So, if you want a happy cat then stop stroking, advises the Daily Mail.</body>

      <body>Excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.The College of Emergency Medicine said increased demand and the complexity of work was causing staff sickness and burnout.Its survey of just over 1,000 UK consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable.It comes amid mounting concern about the ability of AandE units to cope this winter.At the start of this year, the NHS in England missed its target of fewer than 5% of patients waiting more than four hours, as waiting times hit their highest rates for nine years.Ministers have since announced a £500m bailout fund for the next two winters to help those hospitals with the most acute problems.The college has always maintained that a shortage of doctors is a contributory factor to the problems.Previous reports have highlighted the fact that AandEs do not have enough consultants.The average is just over seven per unit when it should be 10 - and 16 for the largest hospitals - according to the college.But now the college is warning that the shortages are beginning to affect the consultants who are in place.In the survey, 94% complained they were working excessive hours - with more than half saying they were regularly doing more than a fifth extra on top of their contracted time.The report also uncovered a small, but growing problem with consultants emigrating.Last year 21 left the UK compared with three in 2008.College vice president Dr Taj Hassan said: "Senior medical decision-makers in emergency medicine provide one of the most vital strands in maintaining safety."A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis."Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the situation was "unacceptable"."Patients have incredible respect for emergency medicine teams, but those teams need to be backed up with the funding they need to do their jobs without being stretched in this way."A Department of Health spokesman commented: "We know we need to do more to support emergency departments to do their important work through winter and beyond."That is why we are investing £500m and we tasked Health Education England with developing plans to encourage more medical students to become AandE doctors in the future."He also said a major review of the urgent and emergency care system - led by medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh - would be reporting shortly.</body>

      <description>Probiotic drops soothe some babies suffering from colic, research reveals.</description>

      <date>1381193976</date>
      <body>Probiotic drops soothe some babies suffering from colic, studies show.Six of 12 trials, involving nearly 2,000 babies, found it reduced crying.The Australian team who analysed the findings told the JAMA Pediatrics journal probiotics may be worth a try, particularly for breastfed babies, but larger trials were needed.There is no probiotic treatment parents can buy off the shelf. And aside from winding after a feed, there is little on offer that is proven to help.Colic affects as many as one in five babies.It is thought to be related to taking in too much air while feeding.Babies grow out of it by about four to six months, but until then colic can be distressing for all involved.Probiotics are a cocktail of live micro-organisms that, once consumed, are thought to offer certain health benefits.The 12 studies identified by Dr Valerie Sung, from the University of Melbourne, and colleagues investigated the effectiveness of probiotics given either to breastfeeding mothers or breast or bottle-fed babies.Some of the studies looked at probiotics as a treatment of colic and others for preventing colic.Three of the five "treatment" trials found probiotics helped breastfed babies, one found possible effectiveness in formula-fed babies, and one found no effect in breastfed babies.Dr Sung said: "Even though the use of a specific strain of probiotic (L reuteri) in breastfed term infants with colic is promising, there is still insufficient evidence to support the general use of probiotics in all infants with colic or to recommend its use in preventing colic."She added more trials were under way.Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives said: "Colic is not life-threatening or harmful to the baby, but it is distressing for them and their parents."We do not know what causes colic and not all crying is down to colic. The baby may be crying because they are cold or have a dirty nappy."All babies are different."Your midwife can suggest practical things that may help, such as sticking to a pattern of feeding and holding your baby and walking around to comfort it."Rosemary Dodds of the National Childbirth Trust said: "There is currently no concrete cure for baby colic, but there are ways to soothe your baby that can help greatly."For babies who are breastfed, ensuring they are well positioned at the breast, and finish the milk in the first breast before moving to the second can help."Babies who are bottle-fed can be 'winded' after a feed to help them bring up any air they take in with the milk; an upright position and gentle pressure on the stomach or patting on the back is helpful."</body>

      <title>Hope for malaria vaccine by 2015</title>
      <description>UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will seek approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trials showed that it had reduced cases in African children.</description>

      <date>1381206650</date>
      <body>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is seeking regulatory approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trial data showed that it had cut the number of cases in African children.Experts say that they are optimistic about the possibility of the world's first vaccine after the trial results.Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide every year.Scientists say an effective vaccine is key to attempts to eradicate it.The vaccine known as RTS,S was found to have almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children in the trial and to have reduced by about 25% the number of malaria cases in infants.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing RTS,S with the non-profit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals," said Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso."Progress is being made with bed nets and other measures, but we need more tools to battle this terrible disease."The malaria trial was Africa's largest-ever clinical trial involving almost 15,500 children in seven countries.The findings were presented at a medical meeting in Durban, South Africa."Based on these data, GSK now intends to submit, in 2014, a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," GSK said in a statement.The company has been developing the vaccine for three decades.The statement said that the hope now is that the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) may recommend the use of the RTS,S vaccine from as early as 2015 if EMA drugs regulators back its licence application.Testing showed that 18 months after vaccination, children aged five to 17 months had a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated contemporaries.But in infants aged six to 12 weeks at the time of vaccination, there was only a 27% reduction in risk.A spokeswoman for GSK told the AFP news agency that the company would file its application to the EMA under a process aimed at facilitating new drugs for poorer countries.</body>

      <title>Euro MPs vote on anti-tobacco rules</title>
      <description>The European Parliament is to vote on tougher tobacco regulations especially aimed at preventing younger people from taking up smoking.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381219629</date>
      <body>Euro MPs will vote shortly on new measures aimed at putting young people off smoking, including bigger health warnings on cigarette packets and restrictions on electronic cigarettes.Under the draft legislation from the European Commission e-cigarettes would become a medicinal product.Menthol cigarettes could be banned, along with other flavoured tobacco.Packs of 10 as well as slim cigarettes - marketed mainly to women - would no longer be sold.Smaller packs are reckoned to be more attractive to young smokers.It is the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on chewing tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.Once agreed, all 28 EU countries will have to make the measures law.After Tuesday's vote there will be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives and should not be restricted because they could dramatically reduce smoking-related diseases.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking."Tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products," said EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg, presenting the proposals.The current requirement for health warnings on packets is 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.The new packaging requirements would also apply to roll-your-own tobacco.The legislation would allow member states the option of plain, non-branded packaging "in duly justified cases".The Commission says packets must be big enough to ensure full visibility for the health warnings, so the recommendation is at least 20 cigarettes per pack.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. It is argued that bigger, more expensive packets are less attractive to young smokers.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The associated costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <title>Microscopic 'bacterial zoos' made</title>
      <description>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages has been built out of jelly by US researchers.</description>

      <date>1381194157</date>
      <body>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages built out of jelly has been constructed by US scientists.Their findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could transform understanding of how bacteria behave in communities.The bugs have different properties, which can make infections hard to treat, when they form colonies.UK researchers said bacterial communities were poorly understood and the technology could lead to progress.Big groups of bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance where lone bacteria would be vulnerable. The nature of a community can affect how serious an infection becomes in open wounds or in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis.Scientists have been growing bacteria in Petri dishes in the laboratory for more than a century.But they do not replicate all the conditions inside the body and they cannot be used to manually build colonies of bacteria, one bacterium at a time.A team of researchers at the University of Texas have used 3D printing to build colonies.They mixed bacteria with a special form of gelatin and let it set so the bacteria were suspended like cocktail fruit in jelly.They then fired a laser at the gelatin-bacteria mix.The structure of the gelatin was altered at the point the laser beam was focused. The targeted gelatin proteins hooked up to each other so that when the rest of the gelatin was washed away it left the "cage".It allowed the researchers to build cages around individual, or small groups of bacteria in whatever shape they chose. By building up a number of cages, they could eventually build a "zoo", with every bacterium exactly where the researchers wanted it.The walls of the cage were able to keep the bacteria in place, but allow nutrients and signals to pass between cages.Prof Jason Shear, from the University of Texas, said experiments had shown that one species of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, could become more antibiotic resistant when growing with another Pseudomonas aeruginosa.He told the BBC that the new technology could start to tackle questions about bacterial communities: "If a cluster develops antibiotic resistance, how large does it have to be, how many cells, what density is needed, is a low oxygen environment key?"We're starting to see that it really does matter how cells arrange themselves, it affects how antibiotic resistant a colony is, so it may ultimately inform therapies."Prof Ross Fitzgerald, from the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: "I think it is safe to say we know very little about bacterial communities."There are millions of bacteria in the gut, but we don't know much about how they function or relate to each other and infectious diseases are often caused by more than one pathogen, co-infection is more common that we'd thought in the past."I think this technology does provide an opportunity to simulate better in the laboratory various bacterial communities that can be present in an infection."</body>

      <body>Three scientists have won the Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology after discovering how cells precisely transport material.James Rothman and Randy Schekman, both from the US, and Thomas Sudhof, from Germany, shared the prize.They found the way "vesicles" act like a fleet of ships transporting their goods to the exact destination.It is crucial for the way the brain communicates, the release of hormones and parts of the immune system.The billions of cells which make up the body are not empty blobs, instead they are packed with precise machinery. In order for a cell to function properly it needs the right materials in the right place at the right time.Vesicles are tiny bubbles of fat which act as the cell's internal shipping service. They can send material such as enzymes, neurotransmitters and hormones, around the cell. Or they can fuse with the outer surface of the cell and release their contents into the wider body.The prize committee said the findings: "Had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell."Without this wonderfully precise organisation, the cell would lapse into chaos."A defective vesicle transport system is implicated in diabetes and brain disorders.Prof James Rothman, from Yale University, found proteins embedded in the vesicles which act as the docking mechanism meaning the cargo is released in the correct location.Prof Randy Schekman, from the University of California at Berkeley, discovered the genes which regulated the transport system in yeast. He found that mutations in three genes resulted in a "situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system".After hearing of the award he said: "My first reaction was 'Oh, my God! That was also my second reaction."Prof Thomas Sudhof, originally from Germany but now at Stanford University in the US, made breakthroughs in how the transport system works in the brain so that neurotransmitters are released at the precise time.Dr Lisa Swanton, from the University of Manchester, said: "Vesicles are like a postman's bag, they have to get to a specific address."They have worked out the mechanism of sending to the right location, they have advanced the field enormously."They have revolutionised understanding of how cells are organised which is fundamental to huge number of diseases."</body>

      <title>New Indian outbreak of encephalitis</title>

      <body>Fifteen children have died in the past few days in a fresh outbreak of viral encephalitis in India's Uttar Pradesh state, taking this year's toll to 358.The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas and children are the worst affected.More than 200 patients are still being treated at government hospitals.At least 6,500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the first case was detected in 1978.Gorakhpur and adjoining districts which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas are low-lying and prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus.The Press Trust of India on Tuesday reported that 15 children had died of the disease in the past few days, taking this year's toll in the state to 358.Doctors say affected patients come from between 10 and 12 districts in the region, and are mostly the rural poor.Until 2005, doctors say that the the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus.But in the past seven years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.The diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure and inflammation of the heart and kidney.Doctors say children between the age of six months and 15 years are the worst affected.A fifth of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.The government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of encephalitis in the region.Last week, India launched a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis as part of a national programme to fight the virus."Beginning with the first report in 1955 in Tamil Nadu state, the Japanese encephalitis virus has now spread to more than 171 districts in 19 states," Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the launch of the vaccine.In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur killed 1,000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since 1978.</body>

      <body>A doctor who prescribed rest, ice, and comfortable shoes for a woman who later died of a blood clot, was medically negligent, a coroner has ruled.Jacqueline Allwood, 47, died 10 days later after a blood clot travelled from her leg to her lung.Dr Saurabh Adlakha knew of the family history of deep vein thrombosis, Southwark Coroner's Court heard.Recording a narrative verdict, medical negligence by Dr Adlakha contributed to her death, said coroner Andrew Harris.The inquest was told Dr Adlakha suggested Ms Allwood had probably suffered a sprained calf picking up Christmas decorations in December of 2012.After limping into the Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre she was told to take some ibuprofen, rest, use ice and stretch the muscle and to wear more comfortable shoes.But ten days later Ms Allwood died when a blood clot travelled to her lung."The consequences of missing a DVT are, as in this case, catastrophic," said Mr Harris.He referred Dr Adlakha to the General Medical Council for review.Outside court, Ms Allwood's daughters Tanya and Leanne Allwood said they were content with the outcome and although they did not want Dr Adlakha to be punished, they did want to believe he would learn from his mistake."We would never, never want to see another family go through what we have," Tanya Allwood said.Her mother had been "one of the most sincere, nicest people you could meet", she added.Dr Adlakha earlier told the hearing he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because "I don't want to be here again".</body>

      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care, Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".The government said the Care Bill would prevent "inappropriate" short visits but would not outlaw 15-minute visits.Leonard Cheshire wants a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to prevent the practice in England.Care minister Norman Lamb said the government "can't ban these short visits completely" because they are useful in some circumstances, such as when a carer visits to give someone medicine.But he told the BBC a 15-minute visit was "completely inappropriate" when people needed things like feeding or bathing."We're actually introducing an amendment to the Care Bill this week which will require councils to focus on an individual's wellbeing when they're organising care on their behalf, and so this sort of very short visit for personal care would not meet that standard," he said.He also said the government plans to "force" the NHS and local government to work better together and end the "ridiculous split" between health and social care.A report published by Leonard Cheshire said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.The charity's latest research looks at England alone, but in August Unison accused many councils in Scotland of providing "care on the cheap" by arranging 15-minute home visits, and in June the union said 83% of Welsh councils were doing the same.Research by the UK Homecare Association published last year suggested 87% of home visits in Northern Ireland lasted 30 minutes or less, the highest proportion in the UK (73% in England and 42% in both Scotland and Wales).Separate care bills are currently going through the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added.Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Rosaleen, a Thames Valley care worker who gave only her first name, said 15-minute visits usually overrun.But she said the short time available still forced carers to make choices such as whether to leave someone alone with a hot drink which they might spill on themselves, or sit with them while they drink but fail to get them ready for bed.Asked if people's safety was being compromised by visits being too short, she replied: "Their safety, their independence, their dignity."Another care worker told the BBC that travel time was not included in her pay, so she would work unpaid time every day travelling between appointments.Sally Lubanov, 83, who is house-bound, said even in 30-minute visits "nothing got done" because carers would take some time booking in, checking what the previous visitor had done and preparing for whatever tasks needed doing.She said 15-minute visits might be fine for giving someone medicine, but for people living alone it was "wonderful to see someone" and short visits allowed no time for conversation.The Local Government Association (LGA), said social care was "substantially underfunded" and councils were under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Walking more 'could save lives'</title>
      <description>Thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people walked more, according to a report from two charities.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people got off the sofa and stretched their legs more, say charities.The "Walking Works" report by the Ramblers and Macmillan Cancer Support said walking was a free activity which could transform people's health.Being physically active decreases the odds of heart problems and stroke.But it also makes a difference in other conditions such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and many cancers.Last week a British Medical Journal study showed that exercise was as good a medicine as pills for some conditions including heart diseases and another study showed walking at least an hour a day significantly cut the risk of breast cancer.The latest report said that if everyone, in England alone, did the recommended 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise every week it would:The two charities run the Walking for Health programme in an attempt to get more people up on their feet.Benedict Southworth, chief executive of the Ramblers, said: "We're facing a serious crisis of inactivity, but there is a simple solution,"We need to see greater investment in initiatives which support and promote walking as the most accessible and affordable way for people to get active."Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "For cancer patients, being active can help manage some of the debilitating consequences of treatment and can even help reduce the chance of some cancers returning."Inactivity is a nationwide epidemic that must be tackled now before it is too late."Public Health England said inactivity had "life threatening consequences".Its director of health and wellbeing Prof Kevin Fenton said: "Inactivity increases the risk of serious illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers."It makes it more likely that people will be overweight or obese. Supporting people to get active through walking can be a major part of the solution."</body>

      <title>More suspected school measles cases</title>
      <description>Health officials investigate four suspected cases of measles and one confirmed case linked to a school in Neath Port Talbot.</description>

      <body>Health officials are investigating four suspected cases of measles and one confirmed case linked to a school in Neath Port Talbot.Two pupils and a member of staff have been affected by the outbreak at Cwmtawe School.There are two other suspected cases, believed to be relatives who are pupils at another school.Over 200 students are being offered the MMR jab after it was confirmed a pupil had the virus last week.Public health officials said two probable cases have been identified in children at Ysgol Y Cribarth, Abercrave, Powys, who are connected to a case at Cwmtawe.Health officials said a disappointing number of children at Cwmtawe had been vaccinated.Parents of children at the school not protected against measles who show symptoms have been told to stay home.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.As the number of unvaccinated children at Ysgol Y Cribarth is so small, Powys teaching Health Board is making arrangements for children to be immunised individually.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.Dr Jorg Hoffmann, of Public Health Wales, told BBC Radio Wales: "Disappointingly, after six months of onslaught of media coverage, after children being seriously ill, admitted to hospital and after a death in the area, we still estimate, or it appears to be, we have 60 cases in the school completely unvaccinated and about 140 who have only had one MMR."And so we would expect about 10% of those to be susceptible as well, we're speaking of about 75 children at very credible risk here."Dr Hoffmann urged parents whose children had not been vaccinated and developed flu-like symptoms - and attended schools where measles was circulating - to keep them at home for a couple of days.He said health officials were concerned to see a confirmed case at a secondary school once again."We are disappointed that there are still sufficient numbers out there that outbreaks are still possible," he added.Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has arranged for a vaccination programme to be carried out at the school on Tuesday.The Swansea area epidemic saw suspected cases first reported last November before it spread to mid Wales.By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic.The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.Two MMR doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.</body>

      <title>Alcohol cravings drug gets approval</title>
      <description>Scotland becomes the first country in Europe to prescribe a new drug which reduces cravings for alcohol in heavy drinkers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24431152</url>
      <date>1381166395</date>
      <body>Scotland has become the first country in Europe to prescribe a new drug which reduces cravings for alcohol.Nalmefene has been given the go-ahead by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), which approves drugs for use on the NHS.It is designed for people who are heavy drinkers but not the most severely-dependent alcoholics.The SMC said it should only be prescribed alongside psychological support.In trials, men who normally drank eight units of alcohol a day and women who drank six a day reduced their consumption by half over a six-month period when they took nalmefene.It comes in the form of a pill which is designed to be taken before drinking, not necessarily every day. Nalmefene costs £3 per tablet.It reduces the release of dopamine in the brain, lessening the "buzz" or reward sensation associated with alcohol.Prof Jonathan Chick, consultant psychiatrist at Queen Margaret University Hospital Edinburgh, said: "I am pleased that Scottish patients will have access to nalmefene, which represents a new option for treating some people with alcohol dependence by helping them to cut down their drinking when they may not be ready, or have no medical need, to give up alcohol altogether."This may help us to engage the many alcohol-dependent patients that we know are not currently receiving help."Scotland has the highest alcohol-related death rate in the UK. The rates in Scottish men are double that of the rest of the UK.The SMC said nalmefene was licensed for the reduction of alcohol consumption "in adult patients with alcohol dependence without physical withdrawal symptoms and who do not require immediate detoxification".The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies drinking risk levels (DRLs) into low, medium, high and very high, where high risk equates to about seven and a half units of alcohol per day for men and five units per day for women.The consortium said: "Nalmefene should only be prescribed in conjunction with continuous psychosocial support focused on treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption."Nalmefene should be initiated only in patients who continue to have a high DRL two weeks after initial assessment."Prof Chick added: "The range of people who put themselves at risk through their drinking is quite wide. Some have not met social problems and are functioning well until they develop an alcohol-related physical illness such as high blood pressure, cancer or liver disease; while others lose their social supports and then tend to fit the stereotype of the 'alcoholic'."Reducing alcohol consumption can prevent these social and physical damages developing, but the changes in the brain of the dependent drinker may make that difficult and help is needed."</body>

      <title>'Infection risk' at piercing clinic</title>
      <description>Up to 200 customers of a body piercing shop which had its electricity disconnected in August could be at risk of infection, council officials say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-24427468</url>
      <date>1381174011</date>
      <body>Up to 200 customers of a body piercing shop which had its electricity disconnected in August could be at risk of infection, council officials say.Blackpool Council urged anyone who had used the Blackpool Body Piercing Clinic in Springfield Road in the past two months to get a health check.It said electricity was needed to power an autoclave device to sterilise piercing tools and jewellery.The clinic's owner James Woods said: "I haven't done anything wrong."The British Body Piercing Association (BBPA) said it was possible for piercers to work without an autoclave and avoid the need for electricity.The authority said it believed the number of customers pierced was fewer than 200 but there was no way of knowing the exact total until people came forward.Blackpool Council said it issued a notice to owner James Woods under the Health And Safety At Work Act ordering him to stop work until an electricity supply was reconnected.It said that was because the electricity was needed to power an autoclave, which sterilises the piercing tools and jewellery to kill all bacteria, viruses, fungi and spores.The owner was also ordered to "thoroughly clean" the piercing rooms and arrange for a re-inspection of the premises prior to re-opening.Mr Woods said he had been piercing for 28 years and had been taking instruments home to autoclave "for a couple of weeks" while the electricity was off.He said: "It's a witch hunt. This could completely ruin me because no-one has given me chance to say my part. It's not right."However, the council said it believed the owner continued to carry out piercings.Dr Arif Rajpura, Blackpool Council's director of public health, said: "As a result of these concerns we believe there may be a risk of infection to those people who have been pierced since the disconnection on 13 August."I would stress this is a precautionary measure. However, it is important that people heed this advice and take a proactive approach to looking after their health."He urged anyone affected to contact Public Health England which will then refer them to their doctor.The council said it was now pursuing enforcement action against the owner.Keith Fakenbridge, the founder of the BBPA, refused to comment on this case but said providing there was enough light, piercers could use single-use disposable needles, disposable clamps and pre-sterilised jewellery.He said gas could be used to heat water.Mr Fakenbridge added: "Of course the piercing area would still need to be kept sterile using antibacterial sprays, bleach, disposing of tissues, clamps and gloves into a biohazard waste bin and the needle placed into a sharps box but you do not need electricity for that."</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24387491</url>
      <date>1380823371</date>
      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <title>Does reality TV help the NHS?</title>
      <description>Fly-on-the wall TV programmes may not be showing us the real National Health Service, warns Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23687320</url>
      <date>1376622383</date>
      <body>Reality TV finds its way into all areas of our lives - including our hospitals. In this week's Scrubbing Up column, Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, asks if the picture it reflects is distorting our idea of how the NHS works.There has been an increasing range of reality shows focusing on NHS services in recent years: One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in AandE, Keeping Britain Alive, and Junior Doctors, to name just a few.These programmes provide amazing insights into the tireless work of NHS staff and the joys and heartaches of patients and their families.They show a health service that many of us as professionals are proud to work in and are determined to improve despite the increasing pressures on it, a service that is a source of great pride.But as more NHS reality shows appear on our screens, do they really give us a representative view of everything that the health service can and does do?In particular, is there too much fixation on the hospital model, the wonder services and miracle drugs breaking new barriers, and not enough on the care outside hospitals that provides just as essential a purpose?And does this bias the public's view of what we think the "right" kind of healthcare looks like, and inhibit our acceptance of change?The NHS is a complex system, and most of us would agree that many modern treatments are unrecognisable from the original service set up in 1948.Yet the very success of improving health outcomes for the postwar big killers is resulting in a new challenge - people living longer but developing more long-term diseases in older age.To meet these challenges we need to move the emphasis away from hospitals and towards community services.I fear that reality shows, as great as they are, may inadvertently reinforce the public view that hospitals, regardless of their standards, are best, without considering the alternatives.The reality is that hospitals are only one part of the modern NHS story.Many core health services may not have the TV wow factor of pioneering treatment carried out by our big teaching hospitals, or be as thrilling as the trauma care that saves lives in the most horrific of situations.But many community-based services are life-saving - such as falls services, which have been shown to reduce death rates by as much as by 50%.And although they are not glamorous they do save lives and, importantly, allow people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. After all, there is no place like home.Services such as these are a critical part of ensuring that people receive the right care.They relieve pressure on hospitals so those who do need treatment can be seen more quickly.And they reduce the likelihood of people having to stay in hospital because the support they need to be cared for at home or in the community is not there.We have seen how the pressures grow on our AandE departments when these other services are not available.Like any other industry, if the NHS is to retain its core purpose and principle - to meet the needs of everyone and remain free at the point of delivery - and in a safe affordable and sustainable way, it has to move with the times. And we need to let it do so.We have seen many improvements across a wide range of areas, with people spending less time in hospital, so it makes sense to have fewer hospital beds and more support in the community.Similarly, by concentrating the skill and expertise needed to deliver round-the-clock specialist care for patients, we are reducing the number of places it is allocated.By improving stroke services in London, care is now located at eight sites rather than 30 sites, with hundreds of lives - and money - saved each year.These changes may seem daunting, and I have no doubt the NHS needs to do more to engage the public in debate.Often we have not explained the benefits of change well enough.Instead, we have tended to engage with communities after we have come up with a preferred solution, and so have found ourselves in long, drawn-out battles over proposals deemed to be without proper foundation or evidence.So what, you might ask, does reality TV have to do with this?TV shows are there to entertain us, and we should not knock the opportunity to improve our knowledge and insight of various aspects of medicine.But TV also provides a useful mirror that reflects society - our prejudices, fears and hopes.And if our hope is to care for everyone in the right way and in the right place, TV needs to start reflecting that.The future I describe is already a reality in many parts of the NHS, but not evenly distributed.So how about a reality series looking at the amazing work that goes on in the community?After all, that is where life really happens. Is reality TV a help or hindrance to the NHS?</body>

      <title>App aims to improve death records</title>
      <description>How mobile phones are helping register deaths</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24164824</url>
      <date>1379723133</date>
      <body>Two thirds of deaths worldwide go completely unrecorded, making it impossible to know if public health money is being spent in the right places. But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414.</body>

      <title>Face blindness: Seeing but not seeing</title>
      <description>What is it like to live with face blindness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24385650</url>
      <date>1381047931</date>
      <body>Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother, your partner, your child. You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions.That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness.David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions."I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there," says David."But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her."David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them.He remembers when he realised there was a problem."I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways."On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: "'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'"What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. "My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality".After that, he discovered he was face blind.There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer.Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: "Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,."It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region."David said: "I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody".He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment."We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her."David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them.He now tells clients: "If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you."Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment.She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness.Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity."Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful," she says.She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind."If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who."I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces."But she says: "Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me."Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra.He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day,Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases.This condition has no cure. "In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem," he said."With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off."Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.Dr Jansari says: "Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!"</body>

      <title>Awake under the knife</title>
      <description>Can you be conscious but feel no pain under the knife?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24357476</url>
      <date>1380930754</date>
      <body>Having a general anaesthetic is a routine part of many operations. But what happens if you are still conscious after you close your eyes?You are in the operating theatre. Anaesthetic has been administered and the countdown to unconsciousness begins.For most people, the next thing they will remember is being roused from a deep sleep.But in a small minority of cases, complete unconsciousness never comes.Being awake during surgery and not being able to do anything about it is every patient's worst nightmare.But according to one of the country's leading anaesthetists, it may not be as simple as saying that someone is either asleep or awake.Prof Jaideep Pandit, consultant anaesthetist at the Oxford University Hospitals, believes there is an alternative "third state" of consciousness somewhere between sleeping and waking that patients under general anaesthetic can and do experience."I call it dysanaesthesia," he explains. "A type of awareness where the patient is aware of the surgery but is neither conscious nor unconscious."Despite being used around the world on a daily basis, no-one is exactly sure how a general anaesthetic acts upon the body.Anaesthesia is a complicated business requiring many years of training and a proper understanding of which drugs to give, and how much.However in general, a patient can be expected to receive an anaesthetic to make them unconscious and a painkiller to numb the pain.A specialist doctor will then monitor a whole host of measurements throughout the operation to make sure that the patient really is out for the count.Even so, in an estimated 1 in 15,000 surgeries patients experience what is known as accidental awareness where they remember aspects of their surgery after waking. Around a third of those will feel pain.The question whether someone is conscious or not is mind-bogglingly complex.But Professor Pandit is investigating something that goes one step further - a twilight state that lies between conscious and unconscious states - and one that his experiments show happens much more frequently than accidental awareness.He has been able to show this through the use of something known as the Isolated Forearm Technique.Before the advent of carefully calibrated monitoring equipment, anaesthetists were able to use this technique during surgery to check whether someone was fully unconscious.The method uses a tourniquet to prevent any muscle relaxants from paralysing the forearm. This means that if the patient becomes conscious during surgery, they can move their arm to alert the surgeon.Professor Pandit has used the technique to show some fascinating aspects to human awareness.In repeated tests, one third of patients who are seemingly unconscious are able to squeeze the experimenter's fingers on command using their non-paralysed forearm. But none of them will move spontaneously to show that they are awake or in pain during surgery."To all extents and purposes, these patients are unconscious," says Prof Pandit. "But they are clearly in a state where they can respond to some stimuli like verbal commands but not to others like the surgery, possibly because they are not distressed by it."According to Prof Pandit, this suggests there is a third level of consciousness.But analysing the concept remains extremely difficult."Mainly when patients come round they will have no recall of the event or if they do they do it's just vague memories. They're unable to remember anything with clarity," he told the BBC.One way doctors frequently explain general anaesthesia to patients is to compare it to being asleep. But that is technically inaccurate says Dr Emory Brown, a professor of anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School."What we need to do to safely and humanely operate on you - to perform a procedure which is indeed, very invasive and certainly traumatic - is to put you in a state which is a coma that we can readily reverse," he told the BBC.This coma-like condition potentially protects the patient from pain and memory of the surgery. But it also helps the surgeons to operate by keeping the patient still and maintaining bodily functions at a stable level.However, what's happening in the brain as it slips from conscious into unconsciousness is still uncertain.In 2011, a research team at Manchester University were able to watch for the first time the effects on a human brain as it lost consciousness under anaesthetic.Using a novel method of brain imaging, they were able to construct real-time 3D images of the brain - rather than the 2D slices of standard brain scans.It enabled them to see how electrical activity in the brain changed as the patients went under.Interestingly, activity in the brain appeared to hot up as the patient became unconscious. This suggests that rather than switching off, the brain works hard to dampen down or inhibit consciousness while they are under the influence of anaesthetic.But scientists are still a long way off from understanding the impact on the brain as unconsciousness occurs."We are still unable at this time to define what human consciousness is, so trying to find a box of tricks that's going to monitor its absence is difficult," says Dr Kevin Fong, a consultant in anaesthesia at University College London Hospitals."But awareness during anaesthesia is something we've learnt to guard against through layers and layers of monitoring. We check surrogates of awareness such as heart rate, blood pressure and rates of respiration, and also constantly monitor the exact concentration of drugs in the blood."Indeed having memory of your surgery is one of the most important complications that both anaesthetists and patients wish to avoid.Although a national survey this year found the risk of waking up under the knife was extremely low, the effects for patients who do experience it can be acutely traumatic.For Prof Pandit, the ultimate aim of understanding human unconsciousness is to prevent such episodes from occurring."The risk of experiencing pain or distress during accidental awareness is very low at around 1 in 45,000," he explains. "But when it does happen it can have a very bad effect on the individual.""So it's not just the numbers that are driving us to research dysanaesthesia, but also the impact."</body>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Did powerful drug make Michael Mosley tell the truth?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>How many redheads are there in the world?</title>
      <description>Can it be true that a fifth of the world's redheads are Scottish?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24331615</url>
      <date>1380669889</date>
      <body>About 200 people took part in the UK's first Ginger Pride march in August, and the world record for the largest gathering of natural redheads was broken last month when 1,600 attended the Redhead Day Festival in the Dutch town of Breda. But how many redheads are there in the world - and where do they live?Scotland is thought by some to have the highest concentration of redheads in the world, so maybe it was an appropriate location for the Ginger Pride march, led by Canadian comedian Shawn Hitchins.While they marched through the streets of Edinburgh, he made a startling claim."It's a great opportunity to bring together all the redheads in the country that holds 19% of the world's population of redheads," he told BBC Radio.The claim was initially reported on BBC News too. But can it really be true that Scotland is home to almost a fifth of the world's redheads?"I can't really believe that figure," says Jonathan Rees, professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh and one of a team of scientists to identify the gene responsible for red hair - the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R).So where did Hitchins get the figure from? It turns out it was a mistake."It must have been in confusion," he says. "I was walking through Edinburgh with 200 redheads behind me and I was mostly trying not to lead people into traffic. Nobody really knows the exact [number]. There was someone from Glasgow saying it was 19% in just the population of Scotland."In the heat of the moment, it seems, he simply got his words muddled, and that proportion of redheads in Scotland became something very different."I am very sorry. This is what happens when you let comedians be spokespeople," says Hitchins. "Also, I'm a ginger so I'm 10 times more likely to make up a statistic."So if we can now confidently say that a fifth of the world's redheads do not live in Scotland, do we know what proportion actually do?"It's fair to say we don't have very detailed information about what the frequency of people with red hair is throughout the world," says Rees."I wouldn't say there are no reliable estimates, but the ideal way to do this would of course be like the census, where everybody's examined at various ages and you have robust data."We don't have that sort of data, but many different researchers have carried out smaller studies where the selection has not been entirely random in the way you would like."It is often said that between 1% and 2%, or 70 to 140 million people around the world, have red hair.In purely numerical terms, it is highly likely that the US has the highest number of people with red hair, because of the size of its population. If just 1% had red hair, for example, that would mean it had three million redheads.According to Rees, the figure for the UK is about 10%.If that was the case in Scotland, that would suggest that the country with its population of 5.3 million was home to just over half a million redheads - less than 1% of the global total.The prevalence of red hair may be slightly higher in Scotland than in England, Rees says, adding that it may be even higher in the Republic of Ireland.Overall, Northern European countries have a greater proportion of redheads than anywhere else in the world."If you're in northern Europe, you get used to seeing people with different hair colour," says Rees."But most of the people on this planet don't live in Europe and if you just think about Asia, it's very, very rare to see somebody with red hair. And in most of Africa it is exceedingly rare to see somebody with red hair. It is an unusual trait globally."To explain this, you have to go back tens of thousands of years, says Rees."When humans moved out of Africa… skin lightened and people developed hair with different colours. There seems to be some advantage in having pale skin if you live in parts of the world where there isn't much sunshine," he says."The probable reason for that is that we make vitamin D in our skin. We rely on sunshine to make vitamin D and if you have very dark skin, it's harder to make that vitamin D."Being pale, redheads are more efficient at making vitamin D and do not need so much sunlight in order to get the amount they need, he says.So, in certain places in the world at least, there's a big advantage to being in this minority.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Footage of a napalm-like attack on a school in Syria filmed by a team working for Panorama shocked the world. Now the BBC has returned to find out what happened to the children who suffered horrific burns.We had travelled to Syria to film two British doctors from the UK charity Hand in Hand for Syria providing care to parts of the country where the medical system is barely functioning.The British medics had stopped off at a hospital in Aleppo Province. It was set up by the charity to provide general medical care, but in a climate of war it is just as likely to be casualties of the conflict who are carried through the door.Within an hour of being there we received the first sign of what was to come.A seven-month old baby boy arrived, his pink face was blistered and raw. His father was also burnt and sat helplessly on a stretcher clutching his son as the staff rushed to help.The British doctors were hearing rumours that there were more cases on the way.Soon, dozens of people, mostly teenagers, were being rushed in on stretchers with napalm-like burns. Their clothes were burnt, their bodies charred and in some cases their hair had melted.Their faces were brutally disfigured with huge blisters forming over their bodies. Almost in slow motion they lumbered in; shocked and in pain. The smell of burnt flesh was overpowering.Within minutes the hospital was overwhelmed. Dr Rola Hallam and Dr Saleyha Ahsam began treating the casualties.There were no shrapnel injuries or loss of blood typical of most aerial bombs.We did not know for sure what the device contained but it caused appalling burns consistent with an incendiary device, containing a substance like napalm or thermite.The pressure group Human Rights Watch has documented the use of similar bombs elsewhere in Syria.All of this unravelled in a climate of fear. It happened just days after the chemical attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus that killed hundreds of people and many were terrified that the same had just happened here.Doctors ripped open packets of saline fluid and poured the liquid over the victims. The few beds in the emergency room quickly filled up and many of the teenagers were writhing in agony on the floor.Thick white cream was applied to their bodies to treat the burns, while yet more patients were brought in.Outside in the hospital courtyard, a water tanker sprayed the crowd so they could clean themselves - terrified that this had been a chemical attack.Fathers and mothers desperate for news fought to be allowed into the hospital, cursing their president, Bashar al-Assad.Eyewitnesses described the same thing - a fighter-jet circling overhead, apparently looking for targets. A large crowd had gathered at the school where the incendiary bomb was dropped.Eighteen-year-old Siham Kanbari had terrible burns to much of her body.She had been in a maths class when the blast ripped through the window.One of the youngest victims was 13-year-old Ahmed Darwish.When he arrived at the hospital he was shaking uncontrollably. The emergency ward was so full he was told to wait in the corridor.Dr Saleyha described the scene."Out of all the war zones I have ever been to, today has been by far the worst," she said."I have never seen anything like that - the fact that they were children, teenagers, same ages as my nieces and nephews."The hospital admitted 30 patients that day.Most had more than 50% burns - which meant their chances of survival were less than half.The injured needed intensive care therapy but none was available in Aleppo's field hospital.By dusk the chaos began to subside as patients were rushed across the border to Turkey for treatment. Some died on the way."I thought it was never going to end," Dr Rola said. "We lost a gentlemen on transfer to Bab-al-Hawa, he had extensive third degree burns."We tried to stabilise him and refer him as soon as possible but we weren't able to rescue him. I've never seen a burn that bad."I think his face is going to stay with me for quite a long time."Two days after the attack we went to the school.It had been one of the few to remain open in this part of northern Syria. But when we visited the classrooms were empty.The smell at the scene and the debris suggest it was an incendiary bomb. It is not a chemical weapon but is classed as a conventional one.More than 100 countries have banned their use against civilians but Syria has not signed the treaty.The air at the scene was still thick with the smell of whatever was dropped that day; it is hard to imagine or to describe the horrors of what the pilot did.The headmaster said he felt helpless. He was too afraid to give his name."The worst thing in life is for someone to die before our eyes."People burning in front of you. People dying. People running. But where will they run to?"They're not safe anywhere. This is the fate of the Syrian people."Ten children died in the attack and many more have been left struggling to survive terrible burns.We visited Ahmed, in a Turkish hospital, a few weeks after the incident. Described as a hard working boy with a smiley face, he now has 40% burns to his body."I'm in a lot of pain," he said. "I had a fever all last night. I'm in pain on my neck and my shoulder."Why bomb us while we are at school. Why?"When we last saw Siham, in the Aleppo hospital, she was screaming in pain. She is now in a ward alongside Ahmed, in Turkey. She told us the day we visited that her body still feels like it is burning.She was in her final year of school. Described as one of the smartest in her class she is now suffering with 70% burns."Please let it be over now", she said. "We need to find a way out. We've had all we can take."As the controversy over chemical weapons dies down, the world's attention will once again move on from Syria.But for those whose lives are being torn apart by war, the suffering continues.Panorama: Saving Syria's Children, is available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer. It will be broadcast on BBC World News on 5 October at 0910 and 2110 GMT, and on 6 October at 0210 and 1510 GMT.</body>

      <title>Fusion milestone passed at US lab</title>
      <description>Researchers at a US lab have passed a crucial milestone on the way to their ultimate goal of achieving self-sustaining nuclear fusion.</description>

      <body>Researchers at a US lab have passed a crucial milestone on the way to their ultimate goal of achieving self-sustaining nuclear fusion.Harnessing fusion - the process that powers the Sun - could provide an unlimited and cheap source of energy.But to be viable, fusion power plants would have to produce more energy than they consume, which has proven elusive.Now, a breakthrough by scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) could boost hopes of scaling up fusion.NIF, based at Livermore in California, uses 192 beams from the world's most powerful laser to heat and compress a small pellet of hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place.The BBC understands that during an experiment in late September, the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel - the first time this had been achieved at any fusion facility in the world.This is a step short of the lab's stated goal of "ignition", where nuclear fusion generates as much energy as the lasers supply. This is because known "inefficiencies" in different parts of the system mean not all the energy supplied through the laser is delivered to the fuel.But the latest achievement has been described as the single most meaningful step for fusion in recent years, and demonstrates NIF is well on its way towards the coveted target of ignition and self-sustaining fusion.For half a century, researchers have strived for controlled nuclear fusion and been disappointed. It was hoped that NIF would provide the breakthrough fusion research needed.In 2009, NIF officials announced an aim to demonstrate nuclear fusion producing net energy by 30 September 2012. But unexpected technical problems ensured the deadline came and went; the fusion output was less than had originally been predicted by mathematical models.Soon after, the $3.5bn facility shifted focus, cutting the amount of time spent on fusion versus nuclear weapons research - which was part of the lab's original mission.However, the latest experiments agree well with predictions of energy output, which will provide a welcome boost to ignition research at NIF, as well as encouragement to advocates of fusion energy in general.It is markedly different from current nuclear power, which operates through splitting atoms - fission - rather than squashing them together in fusion.NIF, based at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of several projects around the world aimed at harnessing fusion. They include the multi-billion-euro ITER facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.However, ITER will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the Cadarache facility will use magnetic fields to contain the hot fusion fuel - a concept known as magnetic confinement.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>Plastic pollution 'threatens lakes'</title>
      <description>Researchers say that the problem of plastic pollution is posing a growing threat to lakes as well as oceans.</description>

      <date>1381183230</date>
      <body>Pollution with plastic waste is not confined to the oceans but poses a growing threat to lakes as well.That is the view of researchers who found significant concentrations of the substance in Italy's Lake Garda.They say the levels are similar to those found in samples taken from marine beach sediments.They are concerned that these tiny plastic particles are accumulating in freshwater species and are "likely" to get into the food chain.The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.The problem of large amounts of plastic polluting the world's oceans has been well documented in recent years.As well as bigger pieces that can choke sea creatures when ingested, there is an equally serious issue with very small fragments called micro-plastics.But research on the problems caused by plastic in lakes has been lacking.This new study looked at Lake Garda, a large, sub-alpine body of water. The researchers found significant concentrations of plastic in sediment samples. On the north shore they found around 1,000 larger particles per square metre and 450 micro-plastic particles in the same area."We were surprised," lead author Prof Christian Laforsch from the University of Bayreuth told BBC News."We have similar amounts of plastic particles in the sediment of the lake's ecosystem as we find in marine ecosystems."Chemicals found in plastics can be poisonous, can damage endocrine systems or in some cases cause cancers.They can also transport dangerous organic pollutants into clean environments like lakes.Previous research on fish and other marine creatures has shown that these species tend to accumulate tiny plastic fragments into their tissue. Prof Laforsch worries that this is happening in Lake Garda and elsewhere."What we show is that filter feeders and sediment feeders and organisms that feed on the surface layer of the lake, all swallow these plastic particles mistaking them for food."There might be impacts when it affects the hormone system, they could become sterile for example. It could also be, that when fish are feeding on these organisms they accumulate these particles also in their tissue."The problem is being caused by human use of plastic materials say the researchers.Apart from water sports, and tourist and fishing boats, the main sources of waste entering Lake Garda were discarded plastic products and debris which may originate from landfill sites.The scientists are also concerned that the discovery of significant amounts of plastic in lake environments could have implications for human populations as the waters are often used for drinking and for agriculture.And they argue that, as in the seas, plastic pollution is likely to be widespread in freshwater bodies."There is nothing particular about Lake Garda," said Prof Laforsch."We are testing in Bavaria and it looks pretty much the same. It is, I think, a problem all over Europe and maybe all over the world."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <body>Three scientists have won the Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology after discovering how cells precisely transport material.James Rothman and Randy Schekman, both from the US, and Thomas Sudhof, from Germany, shared the prize.They found the way "vesicles" act like a fleet of ships transporting their goods to the exact destination.It is crucial for the way the brain communicates, the release of hormones and parts of the immune system.The billions of cells which make up the body are not empty blobs, instead they are packed with precise machinery. In order for a cell to function properly it needs the right materials in the right place at the right time.Vesicles are tiny bubbles of fat which act as the cell's internal shipping service. They can send material such as enzymes, neurotransmitters and hormones, around the cell. Or they can fuse with the outer surface of the cell and release their contents into the wider body.The prize committee said the findings: "Had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell."Without this wonderfully precise organisation, the cell would lapse into chaos."A defective vesicle transport system is implicated in diabetes and brain disorders.Prof James Rothman, from Yale University, found proteins embedded in the vesicles which act as the docking mechanism meaning the cargo is released in the correct location.Prof Randy Schekman, from the University of California at Berkeley, discovered the genes which regulated the transport system in yeast. He found that mutations in three genes resulted in a "situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system".After hearing of the award he said: "My first reaction was 'Oh, my God! That was also my second reaction."Prof Thomas Sudhof, originally from Germany but now at Stanford University in the US, made breakthroughs in how the transport system works in the brain so that neurotransmitters are released at the precise time.Dr Lisa Swanton, from the University of Manchester, said: "Vesicles are like a postman's bag, they have to get to a specific address."They have worked out the mechanism of sending to the right location, they have advanced the field enormously."They have revolutionised understanding of how cells are organised which is fundamental to huge number of diseases."</body>

      <title>EU hails global green tax on flights</title>
      <description>The EU and its critics both claim victory in the battle over green taxes on flights to and from Europe, after a deal was struck.</description>

      <body>The EU and its critics are both claiming victory in the battle over green taxes on flights to and from Europe, after a deal was struck.The world's governments agreed that all airlines should join a global scheme to cut carbon emissions. But details will not be negotiated until 2016.There is still pressure on the EU to delay imposing its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) on aviation.The EU said its leadership had led to the deal, but greens disputed that.Environmentalists accused the EU of caving in to pressure.The new deal was reached on Friday after long negotiations in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).It ends for the first time the notion of exceptionalism that has been cultivated by the industry.The aviation sector will attempt to negotiate by 2016 a market-based mechanism (taxes, tradeable permits or carbon offsets) to tackle emissions from flying.Technical innovations will play a part too. The deal will be in place by 2020, when the new UN climate deal - not yet negotiated - is due to start.An EU spokesman told BBC News: “It’s a very positive outcome. After more than 15 years of talks we got a deal. The reality is, if it hadn’t been for EU pressure [through extending the ETS to aviation] this probably wouldn’t have happened.”Paul Steele, executive director of the industry-wide Air Transport Action Group, said it was "clearly an historic resolution"."It represents significant progress. We now have agreement on a global scheme and a timeline and the building blocks to deliver it.”But there was fierce resistance from some nations in the ICAO to curbing aviation emissions, especially from emerging economies with big territories like Brazil, China and India. And developing countries, particularly in Africa, have secured what appears to be a complete get-out clause.Bill Hemmings from the green group Transport and Environment said: “The EU ETS, the only international measure that actually reduces emissions from international aviation, has been hamstrung by ICAO delegates more interested in evading responsibility than protecting the environment. The text is full of holes… exactly what it was supposed to avoid.”Samantha Smith from the environmental group WWF said “the science is clearer than ever - 2020 is too late".Last month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said there was convincing evidence that human activity was causing global warming."Right after the recent IPCC release, this was the first chance for governments in ICAO to take decisive action, and they failed,” Ms Smith said.It is not clear what happens now to the ETS aviation scheme. Plans to extend it to aircraft were previously put on hold, as the EU compromised to avoid a trade war.The ICAO meeting voted to prohibit any nation imposing its own scheme without a global agreement. But the EU is not convinced that this vote is binding and a spokesman told me there would be discussions in coming weeks over the way ahead.This agonised process for just one sector indicates just how hard it will be to get a global deal on greenhouse gas emissions that the UN expects in 2020.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>Pollution 'hampers bees' foraging'</title>
      <description>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.Tests showed that exhaust degraded some floral scent chemicals the bees "home in on" when they are foraging.The study, published in Scientific Reports, also revealed that a specific group of chemicals found in diesel exhaust, known as NOx, diminished the insects' response to floral scents.They say the results are evidence that air quality should be improved."We got into this, because we were aware of the impacts of airborne pollutants on human health, so it didn't seem so wild that there may be impacts that extended beyond human health," said University of Southampton neuroscientist Dr Tracey Newman, who was involved in the work.To drill down to the chemical effects of pollution on the pollinators, the researchers made a mixture of the volatile, or smelly, chemicals that make up the scent of oilseed rape.They then used a diesel-powered generator to create a mixture of air and exhaust that closely matched levels of exhaust found on a busy road, and mixed this lab-made air pollution with the floral scent mix."We saw that there was loss of two of the components [of the floral odour mixture]," Dr Newman said.The two odour chemicals that were "lost" had chemically reacted with a component of the diesel exhaust, mono-nitrogen oxide, known as NOx.Having worked out how the pollution affected the chemistry of floral scents, the team set out to discover if the bees were affected by this change."Bees need to decipher the chemical messages they're getting [from flowers] to be able to home in on the flowers they know will give the best yield [of nectar]," said Dr Newman.The pollinators, she said, learned to recognise the scents of nectar-rich flowers and this enabled them to forage more efficiently.The team carried out a test that involved teaching bees to associate the smell of a particular chemical with being given a drop of sugary liquid.Bees respond to the taste of the sugar by sticking out their tongues - just as they do when drinking nectar from a flower. So after a few trials where the scent of the odour is followed closely by a sweet drop of liquid, the bees stick out their tongues as soon as they detect the scent."Having trained a bunch of bees, we then tested to see if they would respond in the same way to the mixture that was depleted by exposure to NOx [the reactive chemical in diesel exhaust]," said Dr Newman.When these odour chemicals were degraded by NOx, the bees were much less responsive to their smell and would not stick out their tongues.Biologist and lead researcher Dr Guy Poppy added that the airborne pollution appeared to be interfering with "the complex relationship" that had evolved between plants and animals."Flowers have evolved to produce chemical mixtures that attract pollinators," he told BBC News.Dr Newman added that the study highlighted the need to reduce pollution and improve air quality, in order to protect pollinating insects as well as improve human health.The value to food production of so-called "pollination services" is estimated to be hundreds of millions of pounds per year in the UK alone.Prof James Nieh, who studies honeybee health and behaviour at the University of California San Diego, said that the research posed a "largely unexplored question"."Most research on such contaminants has focused on pesticides," he told BBC News."But bees are subject to a much wider variety of pollutants and contaminants. The influence and potential synergy of these pollutants with pesticides should be studied."</body>

      <title>Uncertainty hampering food security</title>
      <description>More than 600 scientists from around the world have gathered in the Netherlands for a food security conference, described as the first of its kind.</description>

      <body>More than 600 scientists gathered in the Netherlands for a global food security conference, described as the first of its kind.Organisers said science could help end uncertainty surrounding efforts to meet the food needs of future generations.They added that, until now, there were many policy debates on food security but there was no scientific forum for researchers to share knowledge.The next food security conference will be held in the US in 2015."A really key message from the conference for us is that we have got lots of estimates about needs of population growth etc, but at the moment we are so uncertain of the exact numbers - the uncertainty is really very high," said conference co-chairman Ken Giller, professor of plant production systems at Wageningen University."We talk about the current population being seven billion, moving to 9.2 billion in 2050 and the estimate is that we need to increase production 70% or more."But there are many different ways of addressing that. If we don't know what the problem is then we can't get started in addressing them."Appetite for changeProf Giller said there was "unprecedented interest" among the scientific community when details of the conference was first announced."We did anticipate about 250-300 people , but we actually ended up with more than 900 abstracts being submitted," he told BBC News."The conference was basically sold out - we had 600 people and that was all we could accommodate."He explained that the conference was designed to create a forum where representatives from the different branches of science could come together and discuss and debate the issues of global food security."We pulled together a science committee with the real aim to make the conference broad and to include all the main disciplines," he said."We had people on the science committee from economics, nutrition and we had people dealing with food waste, which is a very important topical issue."Prof Giller said that current estimates suggested that 30-40% of the food produced was wasted and not eaten.Other themes that were discussed at the conference included:The organisers hope that the outcomes from the four-day event in Noordwijkerhout, South Holland, will help focus the scientific world's contribution to the UN global policy system.One of the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was to "eradicate extreme poverty and hunger" by 2015, which included the target of halving - between 1990 and 2015 - the proportion of people suffering from hunger.Assessments suggest the target is "within reach". However, a 2013 report on the progress of the MDGs warned that one in eight people remained chronically undernourished.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has announced that he wants to build on the MDGs, replacing them with a suite of Sustainable Development Goals that will run from 2015-2030.He said one of his priorities was to "adopt globally agreed goals for food and nutrition security, mobilise all key stakeholders to provide support to smallholder farmers and food processors and bolster the resilience of communities and nations experiencing periodic food crises".Prof Giller said this presented a "wonderful opportunity for science to get directly engaged in policies and help advise governments".</body>

      <title>Worker error causes Fukushima leak</title>
      <description>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.</description>

      <body>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.The workers miscalculated the tank's capacity as it was tilted on unlevel ground, plant operator Tepco said.It said around 430 litres (100 gallons) of water may have leaked from the tank, and could have flowed into the sea.The plant has experienced several leaks since being crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.One of the largest leaks took place in August, when Tepco discovered a leak of at least 300 tonnes of highly radioactive water at a different part of the plant.The latest leak was discovered by workers late on Wednesday.Tepco official Masayuki Ono said: "We would like to apologise that we have to announce that we've had another leak in our tanks today.""This is partly because we've had to fill our tanks to the brim in order to deal with the difficult management of rain water overflow following [a typhoon]," he added.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tepco had failed to deal with the leaks successfully."It's actually leaking so of course we can't say that [Tepco] have been properly dealing with the issue. It should not be leaking at all," he said.The 2011 disaster knocked out cooling systems to the nuclear plant's reactors, three of which melted down.Water is now being pumped in to cool the reactors, but storing the resultant large quantities of radioactive water has proved a challenge for Tepco.In September, the government said it would invest hundreds of millions of dollars into building a frozen wall around the plant to stop the leaks.</body>

      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <title>Top five physics discoveries chosen</title>
      <description>Quantum computers and science that could enable mobile phone shoe chargers are among the top physics spin-offs chosen by a leading magazine.</description>

      <body>Five physics discoveries with the potential to transform the world have been selected by a leading science magazine for its 25th birthday issue.Quantum computing and science that could enable shoes to charge a mobile phone are among the list compiled by Physics World.A potential new tumour treatment called hadron therapy and the "wonder-material" graphene also feature.The magazine also picked its top five breakthroughs of the last 25 years.In all, the publication compiled five lists of five to examine different aspects of physics.Graphene has been one of the most talked-about discoveries in the last decade.Its strength, flexibility and conductivity make it a potentially ideal material for bendable smartphones and superior prosthetic limbs.But graphene has another, less-heralded property which could help it transform the everyday lives of people around the world.Despite being just one atom thick, it is impervious to almost all liquids and gases.Generating holes in sheets of graphene could therefore create a selective membrane - "the ultimate water purifier" - which might someday create drinking water from the sea."Predicting the future is a mug's game. Of course, we expect to get a few of them wrong," Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com told BBC News."Grandiose, utopian predictions that never materialise always look faintly ridiculous in years to come - have you seen anyone recently flying to work on a nuclear-powered jet-pack?"Physics World is the monthly magazine of the Institute of Physics and was first published in October 1988.Selecting the five most important breakthroughs of its lifetime was "harder than choosing Nobel laureates", according to reporter Tushna Commissariat."There have been so many eye-popping findings that our final choice is, inevitably, open to debate," she wrote."Yet for us, these five discoveries stand out above all others as having done the most to transform our understanding of the world."They are, in chronological order:The magazine's 25th anniversary issue also highlights five images that have allowed us to "see" a physical phenomenon or effect.They range from the microscopic - electrons on a copper crystal - to the enormous - the Cat's Eye Nebula, as photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.The list of five "biggest unanswered questions" features some eternal riddles - "is life on Earth unique?" Another is: "what exactly is time?"The final top five is a set of "fiendish physics-themed puzzles" devised by the British signals intelligence agency GCHQ.The first has already appeared online - a jumbled set of letters on a page which need to be deciphered before arriving at a physics-themed answer.A similar puzzle was recently used by GCHQ to attract potential employees.It will be followed by another four problems, one per week throughout October, which will become progressively more challenging."We think the puzzles are going to really stretch even the brightest minds," says Matin Durrani, editor of Physics World."You won't need any physics to solve them, but they are certainly going to make you think and they're a fun way to celebrate our 25th anniversary."I also hope our top fives in the birthday issue will remind everyone just how vital, enjoyable and interesting physics can be."</body>

      <title>Army robot refuses to be pushed over</title>
      <description>US military-funded Boston Dynamics is developing astonishingly realistic animal and humanoid robots that can cross rough terrain, balance and gallop.</description>

      <body>Meet Atlas, a humanoid robot capable of crossing rough terrain and maintaining its balance on one leg even when hit from the side.And WildCat, the four-legged robot that can gallop untethered at up to 16mph (26km/h).These are the latest creations of Boston Dynamics, a US robotics company part-funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The robots are part of Darpa's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation programme.Darpa says such robots "hold great promise for amplifying human effectiveness in defence operations".Referring to Atlas's ability to remain balanced despite being hit by a lateral weight, Noel Sharkey, professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC: "This is an astonishing achievement... quite a remarkable feat."This version of Atlas is one of seven humanoid robots Boston Dynamics is developing in response to the Darpa Robotics Challenge.In December, competing robots will be set eight tasks to test their potential for use in emergency-response situations, including crossing uneven ground, using power tools and driving a rescue vehicle.Darpa wants to improve the manoeuvrability and controllability of such robots while reducing manufacturing costs.WildCat can bound, gallop and turn, mimicking the movements of quadruped animals. It is powered by an internal combustion engine."It is a shame that such technology is not being developed with other research funding," said Prof Sharkey, who is also chair of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control."We do not know what military purpose it will serve but certainly it is a step towards a high-speed ground robot that could be weaponised to hunt and kill."The video shows WildCat performing on a flat surface, but Prof Sharkey said: "It would be good to see how well it could perform in a muddy field."Last year, Boston Dynamics' Cheetah robot reached a sprint speed of 28.3mph tethered to a treadmill.Geoff Pegman, managing director of RURobots, told the BBC: "Robotics has been making important strides in recent years, and these are a couple of demonstrations of the technology moving forward."However, their application may be limited to areas such as defence and, maybe specialised construction or demolition tasks."In other applications there are more efficient ways of achieving the mobility more cost effectively."</body>

      <title>Omani owl could be new species</title>
      <description>A team working on a bird call recording project in Oman says it has discovered a new species of owl in the region.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24374313</url>
      <date>1380868987</date>
      <body>Ornithologists working in Oman say an owl discovered in a remote, mountainous region could be a new species.Wildlife sound-recordist Magnus Robb told BBC News that he heard the bird's call whilst trying to record the call of another type of owl.After repeated trips to the remote site, he and a colleague - naturalist and photographer Arnoud van den Berg - captured photographs of the bird.They have published their observations in the journal Dutch Birding.Mr Robb's first recordings of the bird's unfamiliar hoot were a serendipitous discovery in March of this year."I was listening through my headphones, when I suddenly heard something completely different [to the owl species I was there to record]," he told BBC News."I know the other Arabian owl sounds quite well, and this was clearly something that didn't fit."The bird call expert said he had a "good inkling straight away that this could be something new"."I even phoned a colleague a few minutes later and said, 'I think I've just discovered a new species of owl."Mr Robb, who is involved in an international project called the Sound Approach, which aims to catalogue and understand bird sound, analysed the owls' call in detail.This revealed that the bird was most likely to belong to a genus, or group of species, known as Strix.Dr Wesley Hochachka from Cornell University's lab of ornithology commented that, in the last few decades, it had become "more accepted by ornithologists, particularly in tropical areas, that new species are being discovered based on distinctively different vocalisations".The team plans to gather DNA evidence from the owl's feathers in order to confirm their find genetically.But Prof Ian Newton, a bird expert from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said he found the evidence that the team had already provided convincing."Based on the recordings of songs and calls and on the good-quality photographs, I was also convinced that it should be placed within the genus Strix, which also contains the Tawny Owl of Britain and Europe," he told BBC News.Mr Robb said he hoped eventually to name the new species the Omani owl, in honour of the Omani people."One of the reasons we've gone through this process of describing and confirming this as a new species so quickly is to get conservation for this owl as soon as possible," he explained to BBC News."Conservation can only start when this species is accepted and given some official status."He hopes to return to Oman later this year in to learn more about the owl, its habitat and its behaviour.So far, he and and his colleagues have found only seven of the birds in a single wadi in the remote, mountainous area of Oman."This suggests that it's a very rare creature indeed," he told BBC News.</body>

      <title>Sponges solve coral reef mystery</title>
      <description>The mystery of how coral reefs thrive in ocean deserts has been solved – sponges are the “unsung heroes” holding the delicate ecosystem together, scientists say.</description>

      <date>1381139098</date>
      <body>The mystery of how coral reefs thrive in "ocean deserts" has been solved, scientists say.Reefs are among Earth's most vibrant ecosystems, yet they flourish in waters lacking nutrients - a phenomenon known as Darwin's Paradox.A team found that sponges keep the reef alive - by recycling vast amounts of organic matter to feed snails, crabs and other creatures.Writing in Science, they hope their findings will aid conservation.Sponges recycle nearly ten times as much matter as bacteria, and produce as much nutrition as all the corals and algae in a reef combined, the scientists calculate.They are the "unsung heroes" of the reef community, said lead author Jasper de Goeij, an aquatic ecologist at the University of Amsterdam."Up until now no-one has really paid sponges much attention. They look nice, but everybody was more interested in corals and fish," he told BBC News."But it turns out that sponges are big players - and they deserve credit for their role."If you want a reef which is colourful and biodiverse, you need a 'sponge loop' to maintain it."It was during his voyage on the Beagle that Charles Darwin famously observed that tropical reefs are like oases in a desert.They are surrounded by waters lacking nitrogen and phosphorus - the building blocks of life - which ought to prohibit their growth.And since corals release up to half their organic matter into seawater, reefs need a system to recover these nutrients and recycle them into the ecosystem.Bacteria do part of the job, but are not abundant enough to service the chemical dependencies of a whole teeming reef community.Sponges (poriferans) are filter feeders which live in rock crevices, sucking up plankton and organic matter released into the sea by corals.The idea that they could be a missing link in the reef food cycle has been proposed before.But it was not clear how much nutrition they could supply, nor how exactly they feed their reef neighbours - worms, crustaceans and other sea floor foragers.On the Caribbean island of Curacao, de Goeij and his team studied four common species of sponges - first in laboratory aquariums, then in a natural reef where the scientists sealed off a cavity.They fed the poriferans with labelled sugars - and traced these molecules on their journey.First the sugars were absorbed from the water by the sponges, then quickly shed in dead filter cells (choanocytes) - detritus which fell to the seabed.Within two days, the same molecules were present in snails and other creatures feeding on the sediment containing sponge waste.These snails are in turn eaten by larger animals, and so the cycle continues.It was not only the speed, but the sheer volume of food turnover which took the authors by surprise - about 10 times more than bacteria recycle.The sponge Halisarca caerulea for example takes up two-thirds of its body weight in dissolved carbon each day, but it barely grows in size - because old cells are shed to the seabed.In total, the Dutch team estimated this "sponge loop" produced nearly as many nutrients as all the primary producers (corals and algae) in an entire tropical reef.And other marine deserts, like deep-sea cold-water coral reefs or temperate Mediterranean reefs, may also rely on poriferans to recycle their nutrients.By recognising sponges as lynchpins - the unheralded heroes of the reef - they hope to aid conservation efforts in these fragile havens.</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>

      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off.The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>

      <date>1380823371</date>
      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <title>Supervolcanoes ripped up early Mars</title>
      <description>Early Mars may have been wracked by giant explosive volcanoes that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24348673</url>
      <date>1380733767</date>
      <body>Mars may have had giant explosive volcanoes in its ancient past that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.Vast areas of collapsed ground in a region of the planet called Arabia Terra are their likely remains, believe Joe Michalski and Jacob Bleacher.The two scientists report their findings in this week's Nature journal.They say such supervolcanoes would have had a profound impact on the early evolution of Mars.Their gases would have influenced the make-up of the atmosphere and perturbed the climate. And the ashfall would have covered the landscape across great swathes of the planet. It is quite likely some of the deposits the rovers are now encountering on Mars have their origin in colossal blasts."Scientists know the planet must have been more active in its deep past, in its first billion years. But we've always struggled to find evidence for these early volcanoes. The supervolcanoes we report in Nature may solve this puzzle," said Dr Michalski, who is affiliated to the Natural History Museum in London, and the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona.Supervolcano is an informal term to describe an immense eruptive event that expels in excess of a 1,000 cu km of rock and ash.Earth has experienced this type of cataclysm numerous times, although not for many thousands of years. The US Yellowstone National Park, for example, sits on top of a past supervolcano.But these behemoths are not so straightforward to identify.Unlike, familiar volcanoes - such as Etna or St Helens on Earth, or indeed Olympus Mons on Mars - supervolcanoes do not build mountains out of layers of lava. Rather, their great scale means that, when they erupt, the whole landscape lets go with multiple vents and fissures. And after the eruption, the ground will fall back into the void left by all the ejected material, producing a large bowl or caldera.Michalski and Bleacher, from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, have identified a number of potential supervolcanoes in an area of Mars's northern hemisphere known as Arabia Terra. It is assumed to be one of the oldest terrains on the planet.The researchers say their calderas are unlikely to be old meteorite impacts sites because they are irregular in shape, and lack the raised rim and central peak often found at impact craters. Neither do they have an apron of ejected material, another classic impact trait."Our best example is Eden Patera," Dr Michalski told the BBC's Science In Action programme."Thousands of cubic kilometres of material would have been erupted, and that's a minimum. In terms of size, it would be very similar to Yellowstone - about 70km across. So, imagine driving for an hour; it would take you most of that time to get across this hole in the ground."The supervolcanoes' gases would certainly have influenced the composition of the early atmosphere and the evolution of the climate thereafter. But they may also have had an impact on Mars' potential for habitability, by pulling up substantial quantities of water and the essential elements needed for life from deep inside the planet.These are ideas that can be tested by Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is heading for a large mountain in the middle of Gale Crater on Mars' equator.No-one knows how this mountain formed, but some fraction of its layers may well be ashfall, possibly from the Arabia Terra supervolcanoes; and if not these particular volcanoes then perhaps other giants that have yet to be identified in satellite images."If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been," emphasised Dr Michalski.Commenting on the research, Mars expert Dr Peter Grindrod, from Birkbeck, University of London, said: "Understanding ancient terrains on Earth is extremely difficult because of subsequent processes hiding or removing the evidence - attempting to understand the earliest periods of Mars' history is even more challenging, as in addition we are limited to data returned from spacecraft."However, this study is a fascinating example of just what can be achieved with data from recent missions. This study is important because, if correct, it not only tells us something about Mars' early geological history, but can also help explain the source of later sedimentary deposits, many of which are important in studies of habitability on Mars."And planetary geologist Dr Dave Rothery, from the Open University, proffered: "It is entirely plausible that the few, slightly anomalous, large craters that Michalski and Bleacher have highlighted are volcanic rather than impact craters. If so, then their size would suggest that they could well have erupted in the style of supervolcanoes on Earth."We know that such eruptions have had profound but short-lived effects on the Earth's climate."Were such an event to happen on Mars, it could either cool the globe (because of a global ash and aerosol cloud) or warm it (because of erupted greenhouse gases). The latter could lead to episodes of surface water flow, responsible for carving some of the medium-size valley systems on Mars."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Roman skulls washed down lost river</title>
      <description>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project uncover 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.</description>

      <date>1380677812</date>
      <body>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project have uncovered 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.It is likely the bones were washed from a nearby burial site along one of London's "lost" rivers - the Walbrook.In the last year archaeologists in London have also found about 10,000 Roman items at a nearby site.These latest finds could give new insights into the lives of Roman people.Near-intact pottery artefacts were also found which probably travelled along the same route as the skulls. Other bone fragments would not have been washed as easily down the river.Paved over in the 15th Century, the Walbrook river divided the western and eastern parts of the city, its moist muddy walls providing exceptionally good conditions for artefacts to be preserved.The discoveries were found about 3m below ground and underneath the the Bedlam cemetery, a burial ground where hundreds of skeletons have been unearthed.Though they have yet to be forensically dated, Nicholas Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology said they were likely to be from the 3rd to 4th Centuries AD, as that was when Romans buried their citizens as opposed to cremating them."It's relatively unusual to find so many concentrated [in one area] when you're not in a graveyard. We're 100 yards outside the Roman city walls."Roman law required burial outside the city, explained Mr Elsden, which meant there were burial sites circled around the town."What we're looking at here is how the Romans viewed their dead. You wouldn't imagine modern burial grounds being allowed to wash out into a river," he told BBC News.Don Walker, an osteologist also from the Museum of London Archaeology, said the skulls were probably buried in different environments, shown by their shades of brown and grey."Forensic studies show that when the body disintegrates near a watercourse, the skull travels furthest, either because it floats or it can roll along the base of the river."They were possibly buried in an area where there wasn't much land available. At the moment it looks as though they've collected together through natural processes."From initial observations, Mr Walker said there was no evidence of any "foul play", but details about their sex and age would only emerge through further investigations.He added that chemical markers on the teeth could reveal where these people came from and what sorts of food they ate.Archaeologists believe that the Crossrail Project will lead to further discoveries hidden beneath the streets of London and say it could transform our understanding of Roman London.Other recent findings include several bodies believed to date from the time of the Black Death and wood thought to be evidence of a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age transport route through London.Crossrail currently operates over 40 worksites and archaeological investigations are carried out at each site ahead of main construction works to build the central stations.The project will connect 37 stations from Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead in the west, through central London and out to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east and is due to be completed in 2018.</body>

      <title>Plastic ingredient spied on Titan</title>
      <description>The Cassini probe detects propene - a common constituent of common Earth plastics - on Saturn's moon Titan.</description>

      <body>The Cassini probe has detected propene, or propylene, on Saturn's moon Titan.On Earth, this molecule, which comprises three carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, is a constituent of many plastics.It is the first definitive detection of the plastic ingredient on any moon or planet, other than our home world, says the US space agency (Nasa).The discovery, made by Cassini's infrared spectrometer, is reported in Astrophysical Journal Letters."This chemical is all around us in everyday life, strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene," said Conor Nixon, a Nasa planetary scientist from the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center. A classic example would be the plastic boxes used to store food in kitchens worldwide.Titan is dominated by hydrocarbons - principally methane, which after nitrogen is the most common component of the atmosphere.Sunlight drives reactions that break apart the methane, allowing the fragments to join up and form even bigger molecules.Other common species seen at the moon as a result are propane, which on Earth is used in portable cooking equipment, and ethane, which is the raw material for another ubiquitous plastic - polyethylene.But the likes of methane, propene, propane and ethane are dwarfed by some truly colossal hydrocarbons that have been detected in Titan's atmosphere.When the effects of ultraviolet light are combined with the bombardment from particles driven in Saturn's magnetic field, it becomes possible to cook up some very exotic chemistry.Cassini's plasma spectrometer has seen evidence for hydrocarbons with an atomic mass thousands of times heavier than a single hydrogen atom.</body>

      <title>Cygnus freighter reaches station</title>
      <description>The new Cygnus cargo ship arrives at the International Space Station carrying about 700kg of food and other supplies for the platform's astronauts.</description>

      <body>The new Cygnus freighter has arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) carrying about 700kg (1,500lb) of food and other supplies.Astronauts on the platform reached out with a robotic arm and grabbed the vessel at 11:00 GMT.Cygnus is on a demonstration mission to prove its technology.It is one of two commercial ventures seeded by Nasa to pick up America's ISS re-supply requirements following the retirement of the space shuttles.The new vehicle, developed by the Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), made its approach using a mix of GPS, inertial navigation and lidar.It parked itself a little over 10m under the station, within reach of the Canadarm2.Operated by astronauts Italian Luca Parmitano and American Karen Nyberg, the robotic limb then grappled the freighter, pulling it into the ISS's Harmony module.Capture - the securing of bolts mating Cygnus to Harmony - occurred at 1244 GMT, when the ISS was moving over the Indian Ocean.Cygnus has arrived at the station a week later than planned after an initial attempt last Sunday encountered software problems.This left the freighter unable to establish the correct communications and navigation links with the space station.Cygnus was commanded to loiter more than 2,000km from the ISS while engineers developed, tested and uploaded a patch. The arrival mid-week of a new crew at the station then pushed the second berthing attempt back even further.Astronauts will wait a day before entering the freighter to start removing its stores.The current schedule calls for Cygnus to stay at the platform for about a month, after which it will be sent into a destructive dive into the atmosphere.Nasa is attempting to hand over routine human spaceflight operations in low-Earth orbit to commercial industry, in a way similar to how some large organisations contract out their IT or payroll.The carriage of freight is the first service to be bought in from external suppliers; the transport of astronauts to and from the station will be the second, later this decade.The US space agency hopes these arrangements will save it money that can then be invested in exploration missions far beyond Earth, to destinations such as asteroids and Mars.To this end, it offered Orbital a series of incentive payments to help it develop a cargo-delivery system, with the carrot of a bumper, eight-flight, $1.9bn (£1.2bn) operational contract once it was up and working.Nasa has also seeded California's SpaceX company in the development of its Dragon capsule. This vehicle has already completed two missions in a 12-flight, $1.6bn contract.Cygnus has significant European involvement. The pressurised vessel that holds the cargo is produced in Turin, Italy, by Thales Alenia Space (TAS).Its design is based on the logistics modules that TAS produced for the space shuttles when the orbiters ran cargo deliveries to the station.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Distant planet's clouds are mapped</title>
      <description>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.The planet in question is Kepler-7b, a large gaseous world like Jupiter, roughly 1,000 light-years away.The researchers used data from Nasa's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes to study the exoplanet, which orbits close to its parent star.Their results suggest the hot giant is marked by high clouds in the west and clear skies in the east.The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters."By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution 'map' of this giant, gaseous planet," said co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US."We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."Astronomers have previously been able to make temperature maps of planets orbiting other stars, but this is the first look at cloud structures on a distant world. Kepler-7b is something of an oddity - bigger than Jupiter, but lower in mass - with a density about the same as polystyrene.The Kepler telescope's visible-light observations of this distant world's moon-like phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere. But these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or heat.So the team used Spitzer to gather further clues about the planet's atmosphere. They determined that light from the planet's star was bouncing off cloud tops located on the west side of Kepler-7b."Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere," said Thomas Barclay from Nasa's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, US, who works on the Kepler telescope team."Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time - it has a remarkably stable climate."Nasa says the findings are an early step towards using similar techniques to study the atmospheres of exoplanets that are more like Earth in composition and size.Paul Hertz, director of Nasa's astrophysics division in Washington DC commented: "We're at a point now in exoplanet science where we are moving beyond just detecting [them], and into the exciting science of understanding them."The Kepler mission has now ended because of problems with the spacecraft's reaction wheels - the spinning components that aid fine-pointing of the satellite. But astronomers are still studying the data it gathered; the mission has so far discovered more than 150 bona fide exoplanets and thousands of other candidate worlds.</body>

      <title>Turbines 'threaten' Dark Sky Park</title>
      <description>Astronomers and land charities warn that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-24325181</url>
      <date>1380501539</date>
      <body>Astronomers and land charities have warned that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park secured its status in 2009.But the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, the John Muir Trust and the Scottish Wild Land Group have written to the Scottish government, asking it to rule out wind farms in the vicinity.There have been nine proposals for turbines near the park's observatory.These include plans from energy companies such as E.ON and RWE npower renewables, among others.Mark Gibson, chairman of the board of trustees of the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory, said that while some applications had been rejected, having one approved could open the door for further development.Ministry of Defence and Aviation Authority safety requirements mean that wind turbines must be illuminated by infra-red light and, in some areas used regularly for training or search and rescue, visible light illumination may also be needed.Turbines near the park could fall into the latter category, and the campaigners said it would affect both the ability of astronomers to use sensitive equipment, and the visibility of stars, galaxies, comets and northern lights.The group has called for the park to be given protection similar to that afforded to areas of wild land, and has called on the Scottish government to update planning policy to rule out the construction of wind farms around the park.The facility is the only Dark Sky Park in Britain - although both Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons national parks have been awarded Dark Sky Reserve status - and is home to the world's only publicly accessible, research-grade observatory within a Gold Tier Dark Sky Park.The observatory was officially opened by First Minister Alex Salmond last year.Prof John Brown, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, said: "Installing any large structures that require illumination (whether visible or infra-red) would be akin to putting a factory in Glen Coe or electricity pylons along the Cuillin Ridge."Our first minister was instrumental in helping to secure funding for the observatory and he opened it with much passion and aplomb in October last, praising Scotland for leading the world with this fine public and educational facility."But Mr Salmond is also an ardent advocate of wind farms and so faces a dilemma."I, for one, would call upon him now to prove his sincere interest in our wild lands and skies by ensuring wind farms and other dark sky contaminants are excluded from the entire Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park."This would lay down a benchmark for future decisions on all similar wild land sites where wind farms are wholly inappropriate."However, Jeremy Sainsbury of the renewable energy consultancy, Natural Power, said studies had shown that the type of beacons used did not contribute in any significant way to light pollution."This is low level background infra-red - visible to pilots but it does not penetrate the upper atmosphere," he said."It only stays within the clutter of the lower atmosphere so is very, very localised to wind turbines."He said wind farm and studies had confirmed this to be the case.A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government consulted on the draft Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) earlier this year."It included proposals to guide local authorities in the preparation of spatial frameworks for wind energy development."We received a large number of responses to the consultation, including many views on onshore wind, and will take these responses into account when we publish the finalised SPP next year."</body>

      <title>Health of oceans 'declining fast'</title>
      <description>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than scientists previously thought, a report says.</description>

      <date>1380777580</date>
      <body>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than had previously been thought, a report says.A review from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), warns that the oceans are facing multiple threats.They are being heated by climate change, turned slowly less alkaline by absorbing CO2, and suffering from overfishing and pollution.The report warns that dead zones formed by fertiliser run-off are a problem.It says conditions are ripe for the sort of mass extinction event that has afflicted the oceans in the past.It says: “We have been taking the ocean for granted. It has been shielding us from the worst effects of accelerating climate change by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere.“Whilst terrestrial temperature increases may be experiencing a pause, the ocean continues to warm regardless. For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation.”It says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves.Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms.IPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN’s) World Commission on Protected Areas.The reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea.It urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm.It wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency.The IUCN’s Prof Dan Laffoley said: "What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses."The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm – but also a roadmap for action. We must use it."The co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: "It’s important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said."He said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today.He agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not.He also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said.He said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting."On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It’s clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what’s going on in the oceans," he said.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <title>UK nuclear plant deal 'within weeks'</title>
      <description>A contract to build the UK's first nuclear plant in a generation is "within weeks" of completion, Energy Minister Michael Fallon tells the Financial Times.</description>

      <body>A contract to build the UK's first nuclear plant in a generation is said to be "within weeks" of completion.Energy Minister Michael Fallon told the Financial Times he was "working intensely" to seal a deal for the £14bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset.Long negotiations have taken place with France's EDF over the price it could charge for the electricity generated.Government approval to build the first in a planned set of new nuclear sites in the UK was granted in March."We're not quite there yet, but I hope we will be in the next few weeks," Mr Fallon told the FT.Talks between EDF and the government to agree on a contract stalled earlier this year over the guaranteed price at which the electricity could be sold.China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group has a co-operation agreement with EDF and could claim a stake of up to 49% in the project, the FT reports.The government's plan to meet its emissions reduction and renewable energy targets were outlined in last year's Energy Bill.It hopes the UK can become more self-sufficient in its energy by increasing the use of both nuclear and wind power, as well as other forms of clean sources such as biomass.He suggested the deal with EDF, which has not commented on the reports, would pave the way for further negotiations on new nuclear plants planned by Japan's Hitachi in Anglesey and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire.There is also said to be interest in further investment in the UK's nuclear sector from companies in South Korea, China and Japan.Mr Fallon said: "There's intense interest there because people can see that finally we're getting our civil nuclear programme moving again after the long, dead Labour years."However, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth have raised concerns over the potentially high price for electricity the government will agree to in order to get the new plants built, and the issue of nuclear waste.Hinkley Point C will be the third nuclear plant at the Somerset site and will have the potential to provide power for five million homes.Hinkley A, which is now being decommissioned, began generating in 1965 and was closed down in 1999. Hinkley B, which started generating in 1976, is due to be turned off in 2023.The last nuclear plant built in the UK was Sizewell B in Suffolk, completed in 1995.</body>

      <title>Earlier origin for flowering plants</title>
      <description>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, scientists suggest.</description>

      <body>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, according to scientists in Switzerland and Germany.The previously oldest known flowering plant-like pollen dates from the Early Cretaceous period.But the team described six types of fossil pollen grains from older Middle Triassic core samples that closely resemble these earliest examples.The research is published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.Flowering plants - also known as angiosperms - are the most numerous and diverse group of seed-producing plants on land.All seed-producing plants make pollen, with each grain enclosing the developing male cell used in sexual reproduction."That's why plants developed a very tough and resistant wall of organic matter to protect them," explained Professor Peter Hochuli from the University of Zurich, Switzerland."In the fossil record we find only this protective wall of the pollen grains."Based on the increase in abundance and diversity of flowering plants during the Early Cretaceous - approximately 140 million years ago - it has been assumed that they originated in this period.In the older Triassic samples, Prof Hochuli and his team used confocal laser scanning microscopy to obtain high resolution, three-dimensional images and identified six distinct types of fossilised flowering plant-like pollen based on size, patterning and structure."With a few differences...the pollen from the Middle Triassic look exactly the same as the angiosperm pollen from the Early Cretaceous," explained Prof Hochuli.Taken with previous reports of pollen in Triassic sediment from the Barents Sea with similar features to these suggests that flowering plants originated over a 100 million years earlier in the Middle Triassic period - circa 243 million years ago."The number of species found in Switzerland and the from the Barents Sea suggest a rather high diversity and that the group might originate from the Early Triassic or the Late Palaeozoic era," he said.However, this does leave a period of 100 million years for which there are no records of flowering plant-like pollen."I think part of it is a gap in the observation, one finds what is already known. Without my experience from the Barents Sea, I think I would have missed the few tiny grains," Prof Hochuli told BBC Nature.As the described pollen grains were rare, making up less than 1% of the pollen count, they cannot tell us much about the period's climate.But according to Prof Hochuli: "The accompanying pollen assemblages tell us that during the Middle Triassic the climate was warm/hot and arid in Central Europe/Switzerland and still warm, but more humid in the Barents Sea area."In the future they could go on to describe these pollen types as new species. But Prof Hochuli is more interested in finding evidence from other places and from even older sediments, such as the Early Triassic, "that's our next step".</body>

      <body>Bangladesh has begun building the first of two new nuclear power plants north of the capital, Dhaka.The plants - each with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts - are being constructed with Russian help as Bangladesh looks to close a yawning power deficit.Inaugurating the project, PM Sheikh Hasina said that "utmost priority" would be given to nuclear safety".The $2bn project is funded by $500m of Russian credit and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.Prime Minister Hasina said the plant would be constructed so that natural disasters could not damage or destroy it."Regarding the design of the plant, we are following the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency," she said.The plants will implement new safety features following the nuclear accident in Fukushima in Japan, officials say.Under the terms of the construction deal, Russia's state-run Rosatom nuclear energy corporation will build, operate and provide fuel for the plant in addition to processing its spent fuel in Russia.Correspondents say that the project is part of an export drive backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin that includes Rosatom building plants in Iran and Turkey.The reactors at Rooppur in Pabna district, 120km (75 miles) north of Dhaka, are expected to operate for 60 years with options to extend by another 20 years.Bangladesh currently relies on dilapidated gas-fired plants for its power supplies and experiences daily electricity shortfalls.Erratic electricity supplies have been blamed for hampering industrial production and economic growth.</body>

      <body>Attacks by hornets in northern China have killed 41 people since July, state-run media report.More than 1,600 people have also been injured by stings in Shaanxi province, according to China News Agency.It says 206 people are still being treated in hospital, with 37 patients remaining in a critical condition.Local officials have been quoted as saying that drier and warmer weather this year may have contributed to a rise in hornet numbers in the area.Environmental activists have also blamed rapid urbanisation for worsening the problem as more rural land is swallowed up for urban development, intruding into habitats where hornets hunt and build their nests.The cities of Angkang, Hanzhong and Shangluo have been worst affected by the spate of attacks over the past three months.The provincial government has dispatched pest control experts to help deal with the situation.China News Agency says local police and fire-fighters have been given equipment and protective clothes to help remove and destroy hornet nests.Hornet attacks are a recurring problem in Shaanxi province in particular, but the authorities have released no casualty figures for previous years.Zhao Fang, a city government official in Ankong, told the China Daily newspaper that hornet attacks had increased in recent years as the "local ecological environment improved".Winters have been getting milder and summers hotter and more humid in Shaanxi, which may have helped caused hornet numbers there to rise.The Chinese term for hornets is "hu feng" - those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia.They can grow up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting.The area is also home to the smaller Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax.</body>

      <title>Award for UK food security pioneer</title>

      <body>British geographer Prof John Anthony Allan has received an award from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation for his work on water security.He introduced the idea of "virtual" water, whereby the amount of water used in food production can be traded when that food is imported or exported.The awards were presented a ceremony in Monaco on Monday evening.The two other winners were US environmental scientist Jane Lubchenco and Spanish geologist Jeronimo Lopez.Dr Lubchenco is the most recent chief of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Prof Lopez is president of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar).The purpose of a virtual water market is to account for all of the water embodied in the production of food.As Prof Allan explained during his acceptance speech, "it takes 1,000 tonnes of water to raise a tonne of wheat, and it takes 16,000 to raise a tonne of beef".The ultimate aim of a global market for virtual water, he said, would be to "trade our way into food security" as water-intensive commodities are traded from places where they are economically viable to produce, to more water-scarce places where they are not.At the awards ceremony, Prince Albert said that Prof Allan had "opened up new perspectives in the management of water stocks and their trade, in particular in regions suffering from [water] shortage, such as the Middle East.Prof Allan, who is based at King's College London, said: "Accountants could save the world if we enable them to put accounting rules into and reporting rules into this food supply chain, which looks as if it's a market, but it has no accounting rules or reporting rules for water".This was the sixth annual Prince Albert II Foundation awards.The three awards represent each of the research areas the prince has named as priorities for his foundation: climate change, biodiversity and water.Dr Lubchenco, who received the climate change award for her work on ocean acidification, told BBC News that she hoped the award would help draw attention to the fact that climate change was "happening now and in our own back yards"."The recent IPCC (UN climate panel) report provides very compelling evidence that that is the case, but that evidence has not yet translated to sufficient action to reduce carbon emissions, and we need that if we are to transition to a better place."</body>

      <body>Hidden cameras have captured the moment London Zoo's first tiger cub for 17 years was born.Five-year-old Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth to the cub on 22 September after a six-minute labour.The pregnancy, which lasted about 15 weeks, was kept secret by zookeepers who are "over the moon" about the cub.It was born six months after the opening of the "tiger territory", designed to encourage the endangered sub-species of tiger to breed.BBC correspondent Emma North said the cub was the product of a "whirlwind romance".Senior zookeeper Paul Kybett explained: "They came from opposite ends of the globe. Melati joined us from Perth at the end of September last year."Jae Jae came from Ohio. When they first saw each other they made the lovely sneezy purr kind of noise that they make."When we introduced them for the first time he trotted up to her and gave her a big head rub so we knew we were going to be getting something quite special."He added: "When it came to her due date, we were all watching our monitors with bated breath."The actual birth happened very quickly and Melati's maternal instincts kicked in immediately."We couldn't have asked for a smoother birth."It's still very early days, so we're leaving Melati to take care of her adorable baby, and our cameras allow us to watch them both from a distance."So far she's proving to be a doting mum."Malcolm Fitzpatrick, curator of mammals at the zoo, said the birth was very important for the global zoo tiger population.He said: "This tiger's one of the most important births in Europe this year."Zookeepers do not yet know the sex of the cub, which is in the exhibit's cubbing den with its mother and will remain away from the public for several weeks.The cub is the grandchild of the zoo's last tiger cub, Hari, the father of Melati.</body>

      <body>A rescue operation to save up to 500 ducks caught up in an oil spill on a lake is continuing in Denbighshire, says the RSPCA.Nearly 200 have been rounded up so far following the incident in Glyndyfrdwy, between Corwen and Llangollen.Most of the birds are heavily coated in engine oil and are being taken to the RSPCA's wildlife centre in Taunton, Somerset, for treatment.The rescue started on Monday after last week's oil spill.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the spill was confined to the lake and there was no impact on the wider environment.The agency was called out to investigate the incident on Thursday and Friday and advised the landowner how to clean up the oil.The ducks were originally reared for shooting but had been signed over to the RSPCA, said its officials.It said they would be rehabilitated and survivors released back into the wild.RSPCA Inspector Keith Hogben said: "Oil can be incredibly damaging to birds - affecting their plumage and so their ability to stay warm and dry. It can also cause a lot of internal injuries if ingested."The RSPCA said the birds were being washed in Taunton and kept on pools so staff could check that their feathers were waterproof and there were no long-term effects from the oil.Peter Venn, RSPCA centre manager, said: "So far they all seem to be doing well which is good news."He said the oil was coming off easily with washing up liquid and the ducks seemed relatively strong."Fingers crossed we can get as many of them as possible fighting fit and ready for release," he added.People with information about the oil spill can contact the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 123 8018.</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24369363</url>
      <date>1381193972</date>
      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <title>On Russia's controversial Arctic oil rig</title>
      <description>How safe is Russia's controversial oil platform?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24427153</url>
      <date>1381147258</date>
      <body>Remote and buffeted by icy waves, the Prirazlomnaya oil rig in the Arctic is the focus of a bitter dispute between Greenpeace and the Russian government - now an international court case.The journey to the rig starts in Arkhangelsk, one of Russia's historic northern ports. From there it is a two-and-a-half hour flight in an old Soviet propeller plane - an Antonov 26-100 - to the tiny settlement of Verandey, where the oil companies have built a small airstrip by the shore of the Arctic Ocean.From Verandey to the offshore oil platform is a half-hour helicopter ride, if the weather is good. But there was low cloud the first day we were there, so there were no helicopters and we spent the night in oil-workers' accommodation before trying again the next morning.When we made the flight the helicopter was an old Mi-8, but the safety equipment was good. We were all given survival suits for the journey, just as you would find in the North Sea.Soon we left the flat swampland behind and were out over the Pechora Sea.The Prirazlomnaya rig, when it comes into sight, is a sturdy structure set about 20m (66ft)-deep on the seabed. The visible part of the platform - the "topside" - sits on a massive concrete and steel structure. The weight of this box is what keeps it in position.Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company which operates the rig, says that this base is so heavy that it cannot be moved, even by thick ice. The company insists that drilling here is no different just because it is in the Arctic. It says there are many rigs - off Sakhalin Island in the far east for example - which have to cope with frozen seas.But environmental campaigners - and not only Greenpeace - insist that the Arctic is different. They say the nature here is unique. The polar bears, walruses, narwhals that live there have nowhere else to go. They warn that the Arctic Ocean only has two narrow entrances - one by Iceland and the other by Alaska. That means there is little mixing with other seas, so any oil spill would not disperse. Then there is the cold.Igor Chestin, chief executive of the environmental group WWF Russia, warns that because of the low temperatures an oil spill in the Arctic could be catastrophic."If you look at oil spills which happen in tropical waters, normally within a few years you don't find the oil anymore," he said, "because there are bacteria which actually absorb the oil and the oil disappears."But if you look at the northern environment, and for example the famous Exxon Valdez accident near Alaska, you still find the oil there. It's still poisoning the environment 24 years after the accident happened. It's still there. It didn't disappear - there are no micro-organisms which can absorb the oil."He says that an oil spill that might disperse in three years in warmer waters might take 100 years to disperse in the Arctic."Not a single oil company currently has the technology to deal with an oil spill under the ice. Some of them know how to collect oil from the surface of the water, or from the surface of the ice, which is like land. But under the ice? There are no technologies which can deal with that, and that means that the oil can spread over the place."In response Gazprom claim they have done everything they can to prevent a spill. The shallow waters mean the wellhead is actually inside the rig. They have a sophisticated cut-off system on the hoses which will offload the oil into tankers. It detects any movement by the tanker, if it is pulled away by ice for example. If there is too much movement it stops the flow of oil.Gazprom also insists that it could cope with a spill under the ice. It says two icebreakers are near the rig at all times, which could smash the pack ice and allow modern skimmers to clean up the oil.The workers on the Prirazlomnaya have been targeted by Greenpeace two years in a row. This year they were ready. The chief of the platform, Artur Akopov, showed us his defences - the fire hoses that his crew used to spray the activists who were trying to tie themselves onto the rig.It was used to deter the activists, and to make the side of the platform more slippery, and so more difficult to climb, he said.The campaigners had put his oil rig and the environment at risk, he claimed."By coming so close Greenpeace could have damaged the base of the platform. When they threw up their equipment they could easily have hit somebody. Or they might have ruptured one of the pressurised pipes and caused a diesel spill."That is something Greenpeace categorically deny. They used inflatable boats, and lightweight ropes.When the activists started climbing the platform, the Gazprom staff on the rig called their headquarters in Moscow. Artur Akopov said this was part of a pre-agreed response plan to any protest action. Within hours the FSB arrived. They are responsible for Russia's international security and borders, and are one of the successor agencies to the Soviet KGB.The FSB officers, who wore face masks, pulled the activists off the rig, pointed guns at them, and opened fire into the water, as can be seen on video released to the media by the FSB themselves.Given the changes in how Russia has dealt with activists in the last two years, perhaps Greenpeace should have expected a strong response.The Pussy Riot punk protest case last year put everyone on notice that long prison sentences are now a possibility.The 30 Greenpeace activists, six of them British, are now in jail in Murmansk on charges of "piracy as part of an organised group". The Netherlands - where the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is registered - has challenged the arrests. It is using the Convention on the Law of the Sea to argue that the activists were illegally detained and should be released."Do you think they were pirates or protesters?" I asked Artur Akopov."That's for the court to decide" he said.</body>

      <title>Row over Spain's proposed solar tax</title>
      <description>Row in Spain over proposed toll on solar panel owners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24272061</url>
      <date>1381100409</date>
      <body>"We will be the only country in the world charging for the use of the sun," says Jaume Serrasolses."Strange things are happening in Spain. This is one of them."Mr Serrasolses, the secretary of an association promoting the use of solar energy, SEBA, is referring to the government's proposal for a tax solely on those who generate their own electricity.They would pay a backup toll for the power from their solar panels, in addition to the access toll paid by everyone who consumes electricity from the conventional grid.Although the tolls vary, if you pay an access toll of 0.053 euros per kWh, you could face a backup toll of 0.068 euros per kWh.The new tax would extend the average time it would take for solar panels to pay for themselves from eight to 25 years, according to the solar lobby.The government says that with increasing "self-consumption", the income for conventional energy systems will decrease, but grid maintenance will cost the same."If I produce my own energy, but am connected to the grid, having the backup in case my production fails, I have to contribute to the cost of the entire system," says Energy Secretary Alberto Nadal.The government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros (£22bn; $35bn), which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices.This is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the renewable energy sector.The government has gradually lowered a feed-in tariff - a scheme that paid people to produce their own "green electricity" - first reducing the period over which it was paid, then limiting it to already existing installations and finally an energy reform in July opened up the possibility of withdrawing it retroactively.At the same time it has not endorsed net metering, a policy allowing solar panel owners to send surplus energy to the grid and use it later. The idea was part of a previous proposal but was not included in the latest reform proposal.But while the government may have been heavily promoting solar energy six years ago, those who followed that lead may now pay dearly for their investment."The majority are people like your or my parents who at one time had savings and wanted to make an investment with a better return," says Piet Holtrop, a Dutch lawyer who is defending over 1,000 of them."Many of these people are going to lose their houses (that they used as collateral to buy solar panels). They are unable to pay back at the bank. They can't sell the installations, because the government has made them toxic assets," Mr Holtrop says.Though many people believe the government has succumbed to pressure from the big five energy companies, Mr Nadal insists that "solar energy is much more expensive than that mass-produced by large utilities".He adds that Spain is now paying for being at the forefront of solar energy development: "If we hadn't rushed into constructing large quantities of photovoltaic installations, we could have had them much better for [a] much lower price. It would have been much better introducing them step by step."The backup toll, still to be approved, has already paralysed the photovoltaic sector. "Nobody is going to make significant investment if it takes over 20 years to pay it off," says Jaume Serrasolses.However, the proposal has also prompted defiance.Ricard Jornet has fitted his beachside restaurant with 36 solar panels. Alongside other efficiency measures, they have cut his electricity bill by 40%.To avoid the backup toll, he plans to split the restaurant so that it uses two independent electricity systems, with only 30% connected to the grid. The rest will be self-sufficient, thanks to insulation and batteries storing the produced energy."I will save more money, because for the little part of the restaurant I will pay smaller access toll. I will also prove to the government this is not the way to do things."Civil disobedience is another option, despite hefty fines of up to 30m euros.Oriol, a chicken farmer, is willing to take the risk of undeclared self-consumption. "I believe they will warn me first. Then... we will have to invent another way to save the situation."The fines were originally designed for electricity companies and have to be approved by a cabinet council."The more people disobey, the more difficult it will be to fine them," says Jaume Serrasolses.Spain's energy regulator has sided with the opponents of the toll. It has found the proposal discriminatory, concluding that it makes self-consumption economically unviable and sacrifices middle and long-term economic efficiency for short-term economic sustainability. However, the regulator's word is non-binding.There are hopes that the European Commission will help, as its objective is to achieve 20% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The body is currently probing one of several complaints against Spain's energy policies.However, the Commission might have a dilemma."They are anxious to not jeopardise the plans for Spain's economic recovery," says Piet Holtrop."We are afraid the Commission is willing to sacrifice the EU legal framework for policy objectives."Other countries are carefully watching developments in Spain. The governments in Latvia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece seem to be pondering similar cutbacks."We want to make the Commission aware of the spillover effect," says Mr Holtrop.The backup toll may not end up being introduced, but the proposal has put many people off installing solar panels in the meantime, which means they are still getting their energy from the five big suppliers."I think they (the government) know this proposal does not make sense. They just want to gain time," says Ricard Jornet."[And] during all these months the energy oligopoly is making thousands of millions of euros."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Can 'truth serum' really stop you telling lies?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>10 heat secrets caught on camera</title>
      <description>Tech provides unique perspective on nature</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/24269057</url>
      <date>1380724825</date>
      <body>Have you ever seen a foraging badger being followed by a bat? A nightjar clapping for attention? Or a cloud of bats feeding over a lake?These are just some of the fascinating insights filmmakers captured for BBC One series The Great British Year thanks to state of the art thermal imaging equipment.The military might have led the development of this technology but since cameras have become commercially available, researchers have started exploring the unique perspective on the natural world they can provide.Using infra-red radiation to visualise differences in temperature has delivered some surprising sights, here are 10 of the most remarkable revelations.Figuring out whether a giant panda is pregnant is one of the biggest challenges in animal medicine but staff at San Diego Zoo have successfully used thermal imaging to give them a new perspective."Thermal imaging is a useful tool for detecting activity in the giant panda uterus prior to the time a foetus can be visualised with ultrasound," says Dr Barbara Durrant who has led the technology's use at the zoo.By monitoring a panda's abdomen, the team were able to visualise heat changes as early indicators of the animals preparing for pregnancy.Dr Durrant explains that the advantage of thermal imaging is that the animals can be monitored without restraints or anaesthetic for a broad, non-invasive view before more specific methods are administered.Wildlife vets have also embraced thermal imaging as a tool to monitor animals without getting too close.High temperatures in specific body parts can indicate inflammation and such information has proven useful in the diagnosis of conditions from arthritis in elephants to rabies in raccoons.Interestingly, while higher nose temperatures sound alarm bells in racoons, a cooler face has been identified as an indicator of rabies in big brown bats.A team of French and Scottish scientists investigating emperor penguins in Antarctica discovered that the animals can actually have a colder surface temperature than the surrounding air.Via thermal images of the penguin colonies, researchers identified that the outer layer of feathers was 4 to 6 C colder than the air.Dr Dominic McCafferty from the University of Glasgow explained that this was due to "extreme radiative cooling" whereby the penguins lose heat to the clear sky where heat escapes rapidly from our atmosphere.The specialised structure of their feathers acts as an insulator however to keep these dangerously low temperatures away from the penguins' skin.Thermal technology was used to study Asian elephants living at Busch Gardens zoological park, US.African elephants are known to keep cool using their large ears where huge volumes of blood are circulated close to the skin's surface so heat can dissipate.Asian elephants however have much smaller ears and are known to cool off overnight so they start the day at a lower temperature.Rather than losing heat through their ears, thermal images showed that overnight heat loss is greatest from Asian elephants' trunks.The titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) is the stinking giant of the plant world. It has the world's largest flowering head growing up to 3 metres tall and smells like a rotting corpse.Researchers discovered that the plant emits puffs of this odour to attract carrion eating insect pollinators from across its Sumatran jungle home.Thermal imaging revealed that the puffs are achieved by a build up of heat in the plant's stem resulting in regular releases of steam which carry the odour through the canopy to attract insects.Bees are known for their stings but Japanese honeybees have another form of defence against predatory giant Asian hornets.If they find an intruder in the nest, the bees swarm around it to form a bee ball - the inside of which reaches 46 C.Thermal cameras indicate that the temperature inside the bee ball is maintained by the bees at the optimal level so that they can defeat their nemesis without overheating themselves.Biologists are tracking the movements of whales without even dipping a toe in the water.Instead they survey the seas for "spouts" of warmer water released by the whales as they take a breath.The technology provides valuable data on grey whales as they pass California on their annual migrations, particularly their previously unseen night-time movements.Last year, researchers reported the first use of thermal imaging in an automated system that aims to protect whales from underwater noise by alerting when their spouts are sighted near mining or naval activities.A further bizarre discovery about Madagascar's mysterious lemur the aye-aye was made using thermal imaging cameras.The animals are known for their unusual extra-long finger which they use to tap trees when foraging for grubs.Scientists discovered that the aye-aye's super sensitive digit is kept cool when not in use but heats up by 6 C when in action.The finger is packed with nerve endings and experts suggest the ability to "switch" its temperature on and off saves the lemur essential energy.In the past, bats have proven difficult to study because most of their activity takes place after dark but thermal imaging has revealed a wealth of information about their behaviour.When researchers found high numbers of dead bats below wind turbines in both the US and Europe, they turned to thermal imaging for an explanation.US researchers recorded footage that identified bats actively investigating and foraging around the turbines.Scientists suggest insects are attracted to the structures with a knock on effect for the bats and birds that feed on them.Experts studied common seals off the coast of Scotland to understand more about their habits during the annual moult.Through thermal imaging they found that the seals' skin heats up to help them shed and regrow their hair.With increased blood flow to their skin to aid the moult, the seals choose to stay out of the water to avoid a chill and save energy.The Great British Year begins on Wednesday 2 October 2013 at 2100 on BBC One.Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Letter from Africa: Elephants' end?</title>
      <description>The battle to save Africa's elephants from cyanide slaughter</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24352104</url>
      <date>1380761882</date>
      <body>In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers the plight of the African elephant.Our world has become a more dangerous one for man and beast alike, with murder and murderers dominating recent news.I was struck these past few days by the callous murder of some 80 elephants in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park.Poachers, it has been reported, poured cyanide into the drinking and salting wells frequented by some of Zimbabwe's 80,000 elephants with the sole aim of killing them and removing their ivory tusks for sale to buyers in Asia.The National Parks say a thorough search of the surrounding villages has already yielded 19 tusks together with cyanide poison and the authorities have made arrests.Across the continent, poachers have been killing elephants in greater and larger numbers - a family of 11 was slain in Kenya's Tsavo East National Park back in January, and, according to The International Fund for Animal Welfare, some 400 elephants were slaughtered in the first three months of 2012 in Cameroon's Bouba Ndjida National Park.While over in Gabon, a country whose green credentials are the envy of many, 11,000 forest elephants are said to have been killed by poachers from 2004 to 2013 because they were after the pink-tinged ivory of Gabon's forest elephants which is said to fetch high prizes and much in demand by jewellers and their customers in Asia.A pattern seems to be emerging here where Africa's close encounter with new economic giants like China has meant all resources are on the negotiating table; but ivory, long protected by international law, can only be obtained by the illegal poaching of Africa's most majestic beasts.It is difficult to know where the blame begins for this sudden elephant murder spree.African detective novelists might lead their protagonists from the urban hotels where an encounter with a Chinese businessman will tempt a poor worker to head to his village and inform his relatives that a little hunting will benefit the whole family.But in reality it will impoverish these African nations as a whole and the sight of elephant carcasses strewn across the savannah with their tusks removed confirm the suspicion that people are the worst guardians of this planet and should not be trusted to hand it over to future generations without unbelievable damage.And so it was heartening to hear Zimbabwe's Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere talking of changing the law so that poachers may be punished more severely for their outrageous disregard for the nation's heritage."We are responding with all our might because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are part of the national resources… that we want to benefit the people of Zimbabwe," the minister said.This particular cyanide slaughter will have affected not just the elephants - birds, lions, leopards, giraffes and many other beasts that used the same watering holes will have perished and the body count will rise as hyenas, jackals and vultures feasting on the remains will ingest the cyanide poison which human hands laid in the water for a few miserable dollars.Ironically, since the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned ivory sales in 1989, loxondanta Africana - African elephants - have had a tough time holding on to their tusks and their lives.Before such a ban, China even gifted the United Nations, in 1974, a magnificent sculpture of exquisite craftsmanship depicting the Chengdu-Kunming Railway.But today we would recognise that that piece was made out of eight enormous elephant tusks, four elephant lives and dozens of repercussions for their grieved offspring.The minister of environment in Zimbabwe is at pains to call this a global problem and he is right.The green concerns of the modern day are alive to the possibility that there may be none of these awesome beasts left should poaching and the markets for ivory be allowed to go unchecked.Rather than turn Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls into a tacky Disney World theme park in an effort to attract tourism, the government would be better off pulling in the elephants' friends to their beautiful parks.For elephants are not short of sympathisers and half a million people in 15 cities across the globe will be marching to draw attention to the plight of the African elephant this October.The cyanide slaughter awoke the social media generation from teenagers to vegetarians to international footballers.The Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey - whose current form has delighted fans in north London and Africa's massive Arsenal following - tweeted a few days ago: "Just read about elephants being poisoned for their ivory in Zimbabwe. Absolutely shocking."The minister was aware of this famous tweet and told the BBC that Mr Ramsey would be welcome to see for himself the efforts under way to save his tusked friends.But if Minister Kasukuwere is to be the saviour of the elephants, he must punish the buyers too, and not flinch at the possibility of poisoning the poachers themselves - the life of a poacher who cannot think of the future beyond a few hundred dollars surely deserves poison too?For the lives of 80 elephants lost so brutally would have replenished the national coffers with their enormous weight in gold 80 fold through resurgent tourism.In the end, the government threw the law book at the poachers - 15 years in jail and a fine of $800,000 (£493,000).But someone bought that cyanide, someone funded the brutal operation and someone somewhere has more of those tusks missing from those elephant carcasses.There is more to be done.If you would like to comment on Farai Sevenzo's column, please do so below.</body>

      <body>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.Local councils have already been warned they will be exposed to more cuts than in previous years.A Welsh government source said ministers were preparing to deliver "the toughest budget since devolution".However, BBC Wales understands a budget deal with the opposition could be announced as early as Tuesday.Without an overall majority in the assembly, Labour will need an agreement from the opposition to approve its spending plans, worth about £15bn.John Rae, director of resources with the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We estimate we are facing cuts of around 4% after the local government minister warned us we'd be looking at English-style reductions."Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said there had been "a level of protection" to local government in Wales, and a study had shown that until now councils in Wales probably had taken "half the cut that councils in England had faced".He added that all the councils in Wales had their own priorities, but services in "discretionary areas" such as leisure, culture, planning, libraries, highways, street lights and economic development would be affected.The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for not protecting the health budget against inflation.Spending on the NHS has been frozen in recent years - meaning it has been cut in real terms after taking account of inflation.A review of the health budget was carried out over the summer.Speaking ahead of the draft budget, shadow finance minister Paul Davies AM criticised the situation in the NHS in Wales where "patients are routinely waiting over four hours to be seen in AandE".He added: "For the sake of our NHS, Carwyn Jones must use this draft budget to reverse Labour's damaging health cuts."In the last two years, Labour has done separate budget deals with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.This year, Plaid and the Lib Dems have joined forces to negotiate a deal with the government.An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said the UK government's block grant to Wales in 2013/14 would be around 9.4% smaller in real terms than it was in 2010/11.More cuts announced for the two years after that would take the reduction to 12.2%.</body>

      <description>Changes to housing benefits are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, according to a senior Welsh Conservative MP.</description>

      <date>1381219157</date>
      <body>Changes to housing benefits are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, according to a senior Welsh Conservative MP.David Davies, on a visit to Blaenavon, Torfaen, blamed a shortage of smaller properties for people on benefits to move into compared to large cities.The reforms see housing association and council tenants having benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.Since April it has meant a 14% cut for one spare room and 25% for two.Mr Davies is chairman of the UK Parliament's Welsh Affairs Select Committee which is looking at how the changes - which critics have called the "bedroom tax" - are working in Wales.The committee is due to publish its own report on the changes shortly.Monmouth MP Mr Davies said: "These reforms are not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham where there is a larger stock of smaller properties."He was speaking as the BBC Wales Week in Week Out programme went behind the scenes with Bron Afon Housing Association, which has 509 properties in Blaenavon but only 23 one-bedroom flats.A third of the larger homes are under-occupied and affected by the benefit changes.Mr Davies met residents in the town as part of Tuesday's programme.He said ministers should be up front that some people would lose out from the UK government changes when they did not deserve to.One woman is losing £21 a week due to the changes and now faces having to leave Blaenavon where her family has lived for generations.Gail Harris has rented the same three-bedroom house for 25 years and now faces the prospect of having to leave the town if she cannot find a smaller property.She has more than £400 arrears and said the changes were "really cruel".Mr Davies told the 59-year-old he was "sorry" that she may be one of the people who could lose out."There has to be a recognition - and ministers may be reluctant to do this - when you change the law there are unforeseen and unfortunate consequences," he told her."In other words there are some people who will lose out who don't deserve to lose out - and I believe you could be one of those and I am really sorry for that."He added: "That doesn't mean we can reverse the whole thing or change it, because there is a wider issue."With limited housing stock and very limited money you can't have a situation where large numbers of people are under occupying - people living on their own in social housing with two or three bedrooms."That situation couldn't be allowed to continue."Mr Davies also provoked anger when he spoke to a young couple."You are not going to like what I have to say to you," he told 17-year-old Amy Evans and her partner Lloyd Mulry."The government have brought this in because we are in a terrible financial situation - absolutely unbelievable."And the days when we were able to fund people in your situation are gone."He told Amy he would move back home if he was in their position and that Lloyd should leave Wales for somewhere like London if he could not find work in Blaenavon.Housing officer Claire Dullea told the programme she could see why the legislation had been introduced.But she added: "If we haven't got those one bedrooms available for people to be able to move into then it's not going to happen - and those people left in the three-bedroom houses paying the bedroom tax are really, really struggling."Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales, Tuesday 8 October at 22:35 BST.</body>

      <title>200 offered MMR in measles school</title>

      <body>Two hundred pupils at a secondary school in Neath Port Talbot are being offered the MMR vaccination.Tuesday's special session has been organised following one confirmed case of measles and four suspected cases linked to Cwmtawe School in Pontardawe.Two pupils and a member of staff have been affected by the outbreak, said health officials.There are two other suspected cases, believed to be relatives who are pupils at another school.Public health officials said those two probable cases had been identified in children at Ysgol Y Cribarth, Abercrave, Powys.Parents of children who are not protected against measles but who are showing symptoms, including a fever, runny nose and rash, are being asked to keep their children at home.Health officials said a disappointing number of children at Cwmtawe had been vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.But at Ysgol Y Cribarth, the number of unvaccinated children is so small Powys Teaching Health Board is making arrangements for children to be immunised individually.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The Swansea area epidemic saw suspected cases first reported last November before it spread to mid and west Wales.By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic.The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.Two MMR doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.</body>

      <body>The ex-chief executive officer of the now-defunct race equality charity Awema is to be charged with theft and fraud.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that there was sufficient evidence to bring charges against Naz Malik.Police will now issue a summons for Mr Malik and he will be charged when he attends court at a later date.The Swansea-based charity was wound up in February 2012 after its public funding was withdrawn after claims of financial mismanagement.The CPS said it had been providing guidance to South Wales Police as their investigation into alleged offences committed by personnel connected to the All Wales Ethnic Minority Association had developed.Catrin Attwell, senior crown prosecutor for CPS Wales' complex casework unit said she had now completed a formal review of the evidence gathered by the police."My conclusion is that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge Naz Malik with offences of theft and fraud by false representation," she said.Det Insp Dave Runnalls, head of the economic crime unit at South Wales Police, said: "We will now be issuing a summons against Naz Malik and he will be charged when he attends court at a date and venue to be confirmed."</body>

      <body>The deputy of Gwent Police's former chief constable who resigned after an order to "retire or be removed" is in line for the job it has been announced.Carmel Napier quit in June after an order from police and crime commissioner Ian Johnston.Jeff Farrar, her deputy who has been temporary chief constable since then, has now been named as the "proposed candidate" for the top job.The Gwent Police and Crime Panel will have to confirm the appointment.Mr Farrar, who has served as a police officer for 29 years, joined Gwent Police from neighbouring South Wales Police in 2009 having been appointed as assistant chief constable.He was then promoted to deputy chief constable in April 2011.Following an interview on Monday, Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Mr Johnston named Mr Farrar as his "proposed candidate", saying he was the "kind of leader Gwent Police needs at this time"."During the time I have worked with Jeff Farrar he has proved himself to be a highly competent and effective officer, " he added.The decision will now be referred to the Gwent Police and Crime Panel - which oversees and scrutinises the PCC - on 8 November for it to confirm the appointment.Gwent Police said Mr Farrar was the only candidate to apply for the role, which comes with a £133,068 a year salary.It comes after a police watchdog said the forced departure Mrs Napier brought instability to Gwent Police at a critical time.HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said in July that the force faced a difficult challenge as the force has to save £23.5m by 2015.In July, Mrs Napier told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that she was forced to resign following "menacing and bullying" treatment by the force's police commissioner.Mr Johnston denied the allegations and that the resignation had caused instability.</body>

      <title>Ex-mayor 'blew up car for thrill'</title>
      <description>A former mayor got a "thrill" from setting off dangerous explosives near where he lived, a court hears.</description>

      <body>A former mayor got a "thrill" from setting off dangerous explosives near his home, a court has heard.John Larsen, 46, of Lenten Pool, Denbigh, is accused of blowing up a car and causing a string of other explosions near where he lived.Caernarfon Crown Court heard he had an "active interest in pyrotechnics".The ex-Denbigh mayor denies three arson charges, one of causing an explosion and two of possessing explosives - one with intent to endanger life.At the start of his trial, a jury of six men and six women was told that in February 2013 a series of small explosions occurred in the town which damaged a number of cars.It led to a "main explosion" on 24 March when a device, akin to a bomb, was placed under a Land Rover Discovery in Denbigh.The explosion damaged the vehicle, along with one parked beside it, while ball-bearings and shrapnel from the device were thrown "far and in all directions"."Windows were smashed. These events brought fear to the local community," said prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones."He was living right in the middle of it, a matter of a few feet from where that improvised explosive device had exploded."At the time he was a local councillor. He was well-known within the local community. In 1999 he had been mayor of Denbigh. He was a member of the local neighbourhood watch."Not surprisingly there was media interest in what was going on and the defendant voiced his opinions."The prosecution said it believed Mr Larsen was behind the explosions as they stopped after he was arrested on 19 April."There is a strong and compelling case against the defendant proving he was responsible," said Mr Lloyd Jones."The prosecution don't have to prove a motive but it is highly likely the defendant was getting a thrill from what he was doing and the attention these events were generating."Items recovered by police from his home, from his computer, reveal a most active interest on his part in pyrotechnics."The barrister claimed Mr Larsen, who was working as a Liberal Democrat town councillor up until his arrest, had been experimenting with explosives.He said that when Mr Larsen's computer was examined after his arrest there was a file dated 13 March headed "experimentation" which contained notes about charges, fuses, flash powder, "rockets and shells" and notes about various chemicals.Three days before that computer file had been created, there had been an early morning loud explosion near a local supermarket.Mr Lloyd Jones said on 24 March a neighbour decided to keep watch from her bedroom to try and catch whoever was responsible for the bangs.She saw Mr Larsen leave his home and bend down by vehicles parked on a traffic island including the Land Rover Discovery converted to run on liquid petroleum gas.He returned home and minutes later there was an explosion which smashed windows at a house.Ball-bearings were recovered and one had hit a headboard in an upstairs bedroom, the court was told."It's fortunate indeed there was nobody in that bed," Mr Lloyd Jones added."When one is talking of explosions and ball-bearings flying and metal fragments - shrapnel - the risk to life and property is obvious."The case continues.</body>

      <body>A man who admitted posting offensive remarks online about murdered Welsh schoolgirl April Jones has been ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.Liam Young, 25, from Ardrossan, North Ayrshire, made the comments on Facebook during the search for the five-year-old, whose body has never been found.He admitted disorderly conduct by sending indecent and offensive remarks.Mark Bridger, 47, was jailed for life for abducting April near her home in Machynlleth, Powys, and murdering her.A massive police operation was launched after April went missing on 1 October 2012 while playing near her home.Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard how two days into the search, Young was involved in a three-way conversation on Facebook in which each participant was "trying to be more shocking than the other".Young's lawyer Graeme Cunningham told the court: "Mr Young probably won with his message, as shocking and stupid as it was."Referring to his client he said: "He apologises unreservedly and a lesson has been learned, to the extent that he was photographed leaving court and his picture, with some unpleasant comments about him, was plastered across the national and UK newspapers."The articles written about him were less than flattering, and rightly so."The repercussions already visited upon him are far more damaging than other punishments."The court heard how Young was sacked from his council job after his employers found out about the offence.Passing sentence, Sheriff Brian Murphy told Young: "It concerns me that someone believes they can say what they like on Facebook because they live in a democratic society."I trust you will leave here knowing the right to freedom of speech is not unlimited."What you said was deeply offensive and you lost your job over this."An arrest warrant was earlier issued for co-accused Gordon Mullen, 24, of Saltcoats, who denies a similar charge arising from the same incident.In May, Bridger was convicted at Mold Crown Court of April's abduction, murder, and perverting the course of justice. He was given a whole life term.</body>

      <title>Coleman 'not judged' on next games</title>
      <description>FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford says Chris Coleman's future as Wales manager does not hinge solely on their next two games.</description>

      <date>1381212991</date>
      <body>Chris Coleman's new contract as Wales manager will not hinge solely on their final two World Cup qualifiers.Football Association of Wales chief Jonathan Ford had previously hinted Coleman's future could depend on the results against Macedonia and Belgium.But Ford told BBC Radio Wales on Monday that "we're not going to judge anybody on just two games", although he also stressed that more wins were needed.Coleman's current contract expires at the end of November 2013.The 43-year-old, who was appointed in January 2012 on a two-and-a-half-year contract following the death of Gary Speed, has said he is undecided whether he will sign his new contract with Wales.But Coleman has said he will lead Wales against Macedonia on Friday night, Belgium on 15 October and in a friendly against Finland at the Cardiff City Stadium on 16 November.Wales have won just three of their 12 games under Coleman, with their last victory coming against Scotland in March, and they sit bottom of their qualifying group."Chris has been there a couple of years of course and, forgive me, there's been some fantastic periods within his reign where we've seen some fantastic football," Ford said."Let's not forget the circumstances in which he took over. It took a while, it would take any manager - no matter what their skill level - a while."And of course we've seen some fantastic performances: two great performances against Scotland; a fantastic win against Austria; very, very close [to winning] against Croatia and arguably we should have won that."Ford recognised that Coleman has an uphill task in the games against Macedonia and Belgium, as injuries and suspensions have seen the Wales boss forced to call up nine replacement players to his squad."With the injuries that we have of course it's going to be very, very difficult," Ford said."Nobody is going to judge one person on any one match and certainly not in these circumstances... if he was on trial now I think anybody would pack in right now."But the FAW chief did concede that Wales "need to win considerably more than we lose".He added: "It's a results-based business... I want to win every single match, I want to be with the fans - every fan in this country wants us to win every single match, that has not changed, it will never change in the future."We must win, we must look to win, we must look to qualify, that must be our objective, that has to be our goal."We do need to ensure that we have a full evaluation period, look back over the last couple of years with Chris and decide with him what is the best way forward."</body>

      <title>Council spent £488,000 'unlawfully'</title>
      <description>A council at the centre of a police investigation into pay rises for senior staff spent more than £488,000 on unlawful payments, it emerges.</description>

      <body>A council at the centre of a police investigation into pay rises for senior staff spent more than £488,000 on unlawful payments, it has emerged.Auditors declared Caerphilly council spent £270,364 unlawfully last year.But a subsequent review, revealed in the council's annual accounts, shows an additional £218,563 was paid unlawfully.The council said it had voluntarily referred the matter to its external auditors a few months ago.Its chief executive and deputy have been questioned by police investigating the payments.Recently published accounts for 2012/13 show Caerphilly spent £102,709 on a buy-out of essential car use allowances and £115,854 on a buy-out of additional annual leave.The payments were considered unlawful because they were decided by people without the appropriate authority, the accounts say.A Caerphilly council spokesman said the payments had been referred to auditors.They come on top of the £270,364 considered unlawful by the Wales Audit Office (WAO).The accounts show five top officers, including chief executive Anthony O'Sullivan, received unlawful salary payments worth a combined £94,081.Mr O'Sullivan got unlawful payments totalling £25,182.In March, an Audit Office report said pay rises for 21 senior staff at Caerphilly were unlawful because the committee meeting which approved a new pay structure - recommended in a report written by the chief executive himself - had not been advertised properly.The matter is now being investigated by Avon and Somerset Police.A separate report by the WAO published last month says Caerphilly council has "significant failings in its governance arrangements".As a result, the Auditor General is conducting a special inspection of the authority.Former chief executive Stuart Rosser was brought back in as interim boss of the council in July.He left in 2010, but returned to replace Mr O'Sullivan who has been suspended along with deputy chief executive Nigel Barnett.The council's accounts say: "Certain officers, including the chief executive, who would have been (and were) beneficiaries of the decision were present throughout the meeting to approve the salary increases."No declarations of interest were made and these officers did not leave the room whilst the decision was made."In doing so, they participated in the decision-making process."A council spokesman said: "We have received confirmation from the Wales Audit Office that they consider payments made to senior officers relating to the buy out of car allowances and additional annual leave as being 'unlawful expenditure'."A few months ago we voluntarily referred the matter to our external auditors and it is still being investigated. We are currently awaiting their view on the matter."</body>

      <title>'Lifestyle changes affecting NHS'</title>
      <description>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of the health choices they have made, says the health minister.</description>

      <date>1381154320</date>
      <body>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of their lifestyle choices, said the Welsh health minister.Mark Drakeford said people needed to understand the consequences of becoming obese or drinking too much.He backed one Welsh health board's policy of making overweight people attend health courses before being put on treatment waiting lists.A BBC Wales poll found 82% people thought the policy should be extended.The survey of 502 people marks the start of a new season of BBC Wales programmes called Live Longer Wales about people's lifestyles.In one programme, Mr Drakeford denied claims of a "nanny state" claiming that "what the state does when it helps people to understand the consequences of their action is not nannying at all, it is acting as one responsible adult would to another".In July, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board launched its weight management programme saying improving weight before an operation gives a better outcome.Under the new policy, anyone who wants elective surgery with a body-mass index (BMI) above 40 must have been "offered, accepted and completed weight management support" before being added to the waiting list.Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, an independent group looking at the treatment and management of obesity issues, has criticised the weight management programme and warned the drop-out rate could be high.He said: "I think it's ridiculous and the reason that it's ridiculous is if someone is morbidly obese there is no way that sending them on a course is going to reduce their size sufficiently."Cardiff and Vale stress that the patients need not have lost weight [by the end of the course] so what's the point of sending them on a course?"He said bariatric surgery, which involves stomach size reduction, was a first option for weight loss.Mr Fry said the cost of the surgery would be recouped by a saving in the cost of treating diabetes and cardiovascular problems in obese people.Speaking about the poll results, he said: "That just reflects the stigma which is attached to fat people."The immediate reaction for the main part is that if you are fat, it's your fault and you should pay for it yourself and you have got to dig yourself out of your own problem."But Mr Drakeford said overweight people were less likely to benefit clinically from some operations.He added: "If you don't put yourself in a position where that treatment will be effective then that treatment won't be available to you."He said he was "not in favour of penalising people", adding it is "more than education - it is about motivation"."And it is about persuading people that if they want to live longer and they want to live healthily then that means eating better, moving more and drinking less," he said.Live Longer Wales: The Shape of Wales is on BBC One Wales on Monday, 7 October at 22:35 BST. It is part of a new season of programmes from BBC Wales throughout October.</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that new UK coins have been produced to mark a royal christening.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace - just over three months after his birth.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <body>A mothballed abattoir site on Anglesey is to be put up for sale after its new owners said it was not suitable for their needs.The former Welsh Country Foods plant at Gaerwen closed in April with the loss of 325 jobs after previous owners Vion sold the site to 2 Sisters Food Group.The factory had processed 640,000 lambs, making it the largest site of its kind in north Wales.2 Sisters Food Group said it had taken the decision following a review.The company took over Vion's sister plant in Llangefni, where it has expanded its chicken processing operations.In a statement, 2 Sisters said: "We've undertaken a full and detailed internal review of the site and unfortunately it doesn't meet our future operational requirements."Therefore, the building will be put up for sale in the next few weeks."Paddy McNaught from the Unite union said there had been rumours the site would go back on the market."Hopefully the people that showed an interest previously will re-look at the site," he said, adding an unnamed Irish company had previously been linked to a takeover.He said the closure had meant farmers now had to take their lambs for processing to Preston in Lancashire or Newtown in Powys.If the site reopened, it would represent a "substantial amount of new jobs" which would "mean a great deal to the people of Anglesey," Mr McNaught added.</body>

      <title>Tourism discount for locals proposed</title>
      <description>A card giving people in Conwy county a discount on local tourist attractions could help protect jobs, the council hopes.</description>

      <date>1381135544</date>
      <body>A card giving people in Conwy county a discount on local tourist attractions could help save jobs, say council officers.Tourism is worth more than £600m a year to the local economy and Conwy council wants to encourage more residents to spend money at sites and attractions.The proposed "Conwy Card" would give locals a 20% discount and it is hoped it could boost income out of season.Attractions in the area include Conwy Castle and Llandudno's Great Orme.Councillors will vote on the plans.One of the first businesses to back the scheme was Llandudno Ski and Snowboard Centre.Manager Nigel Treacy said: "It's amazing the number of people who live in this area who've never been to the war museum, or never been up Snowdon or been to the ski centre."There are some fantastic facilities on site and places to visit and explore like Conwy Castle etc, and it's amazing the number of people who have never been to them."The report before councillors said tourism also indirectly accounted for up to 11,200 jobs, around 30% of the jobs available in the area.It said the proposed card aimed to encourage local people to visit attractions to "keep money circulating in the local economy".As well as smoothing out seasonal peaks and troughs in tourism trade, it would also help promote the county as a "staycation" destination for residents, it said.Councillor Graham Rees, who is responsible for tourism in the county, said the card also aimed to address some of the cost of visiting an attraction regularly.He said: "If you've got three or four children, it's very expensive to visit one of our tourist attractions."We hope this will solve the problem of people from the affordability point of view and will also help the trade in the winter months when things are quiet."The report acknowledged there was a risk not enough attractions would sign up for the card or there could be a lack of take up by residents.The local authority discusses the card on Monday with a final vote by the council's cabinet on Tuesday.If the proposals are approved, the aim is to deliver a card to some 55,000 homes by May next year.</body>

      <body>Early morning and evening train services between Harlech and Porthmadog in Gwynedd are being suspended from Monday for repairs on an unsafe pylon.National Grid engineers need to stabilise the pylon in the estuary of the River Dwyryd near Porthmadog.The Cambrian Coast Line railway is at risk from the overhead cables falling and a precautionary 100m exclusion zone has been set up.Daytime services should not be affected, Arriva Trains Wales said.Engineers will monitor the situation between 07.20 to 18.45 BST to ensure it is safe to operate a train service under the cables, the train operator said in a statement.Daytime services, including school train services, are not expected to be affected by the repair work. However, they may be subject to last-minute delays or cancelations.One of the foundations that supports the pylon at Llandecwyn has eroded, causing it to list slightly and National Grid engineers are due to work on it.Trains will run at booked times between Machynlleth and Harlech, and Porthmadog and Pwllheli with replacement road transport operating between Harlech and Porthmadog.The unsafe pylon has also led to road closures and local diversions, meaning the replacement road transport is unable to call at Llandecwyn station.A spokesman said customers were advised to check their website for service updates before travelling.</body>

      <body>A consultation on plans for 1,700 new homes in a Denbighshire community has started.Residents in Bodelwyddan opposed Denbighshire council's proposals to earmark land for a major redevelopment including a school, community facilities and a site for businesses.But the local development plan was ratified in June with some now saying they felt it was already a "done deal".The council said the community's views would be taken into account.Town councillor Derek Barker said while the county council needed to find sites for new homes for the future, he did not think building so many in one community was a viable solution.He raised concerns about the need for new infrastructure and whether there was enough work in the area to sustain people on the site, which could occupy 26 hectares (64 acres)."We have lived under this cloud for years," he said."It is a done deal. All their eggs are in the one basket," he added, referring to the council's plans."Is there a market for 1,700 houses in Bodelwyddan? There are no jobs here."Planning for Real, a not-for-profit organisation, is holding drop-in sessions at Bodelwyddan Community Centre on Monday until 20:00 BST and on Saturday from 11:00-16:00 BST.A council spokesperson said: "The results of the sessions will be fed into a development brief for the new site which will be consulted upon in the New Year."The development brief will set out what the council and the community require from the new development and will be used when assessing any future planning applications on the site."Company Barwood Land and Estate has some plans for Bodelwyddan but nothing has been formally submitted to the county council.</body>

      <title>Resort revamp sees homes demolished</title>
      <description>Demolition work starts on the next phase of a project to regenerate a Denbighshire seaside town.</description>

      <body>Demolition work has started on the next phase of a project to regenerate a Denbighshire seaside town.The county council secured more than £8m to buy and flatten some rundown properties in Rhyl and create a new green space as part of its plans.The work at Gronant Street comes amid news the council failed to secure £12m to revamp another part of the resort.The council said it was "bitterly disappointed" but regeneration of the town centre was still its priority.The demolition work began in 2011 with the clearing of some properties just away from the town centre at Aquarium Street.Last year emergency action was taken to start the process to demolish the former Honey Club nightclub over concerns about the safety of the building.Work has since started on developing that site into a hotel.Last month, the council was informed it had lost a bid to be shortlisted for a share of the Welsh government's £90m Vibrant and Viable Places fund, which it hoped to use to "change the face of Rhyl town centre".The council wanted £12m over three years for its regeneration as work continues on other projects around the resort, including a multimillion-pound overhaul of Rhyl Harbour.In a statement, Denbighshire leader Councillor Hugh Evans said the council was making "urgent inquiries" to seek money from other sources, including a £5m Welsh government fund for smaller projects.He added: "We believe that our proposals for investment in the town centre would have been the final piece in the jigsaw that Rhyl needed to return to its rightful place as a prosperous, successful and attractive seaside town."</body>

      <body>Land used by fly-tippers has been turned into a community fishery and recreation area in Denbighshire.The £170,000 project saw 40,000 tonnes of material excavated at Rhyl Cut to create a pool and the earth used to build a mountain bike trail and traffic-free route for walkers.The land had become an official dumping ground for years before the clean-up began in March.Now the plan is to extend it as a "green corridor" through Rhyl.Denbighshire council countryside officer Garry Davies said the transformed site has been well received by residents, leading to a community fishing club being set up.There is now a five-year plan being drawn up to try to secure funds to cut a green route through the town to provide a traffic-free route."Because of the work started here we think we can do it," he said.In order to create the fishing area thousands of tonnes of material was removed from the Cut's flood alleviation channel to improve drainage.It has since been used to create a near two-mile (3km) mountain bike course at the former tip at Glan Morfa at nearby Marsh Road.ScottishPower relocated a high power electricity cable which was in the excavation area.And the adjacent landowner at Marine Holiday Park allowed a path to be laid across the site.The land falls within a Communities First area regarded as deprived.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is stocking the pool with roach, bream and rudd.Local school children are due to help with their release next week.Tim Jones from NRW said: "This project will enable the community and especially young people to enjoy the natural environment."It has transformed what was once an eyesore and a hazard to the public into an asset the people of Rhyl South West can be proud of."The Federation of Welsh Anglers has agreed to show local people how to fish when the Cut is officially opened on 11 October.</body>

      <body>A three-month project to fell up to 10,000 diseased larch trees has started in Ceredigion.The trees at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth, are infected with the fungus-like Phytophthora ramorum.It follows the felling of diseased larch trees at Wentwood Forest near Newport, Wales' largest ancient woodland, on Friday.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said between 8,000 and 10,000 trees were set for the chop at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian and 4,000 tonnes of timber would be removed.The environmental body took the decision to fell the trees in an effort to slow the spread of the disease to other areas and other tree species.NRW, which looks after Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian forest centre on behalf of the Welsh government, said part of the site which was popular with mountain bikers and walkers would shut while the work took place.Horse riding trails at the site will be closed but walking and orienteering trails will remain open but with some disruption.For safety reasons the centre's two play areas have been closed for two weeks.Plans are to replace the felled trees with about 13,000 oak trees and other native species before next spring.</body>

      <body>An Oxford University music student has won the Bryn Terfel Scholarship at the Urdd Gobaith Cymru youth competition in Aberystwyth.Flautist Chloe-Angharad Bradshaw from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, took the £4,000 prize following a concert at the Great Hall in Aberystwyth Arts Centre.Judges called her a "master at creating the fine sound of the flute".Ms Bradshaw plans to use the money to pay for travel expenses to overseas auditions for further study.As well as her studies at Oxford, she is also president of the university's music society and a member of the orchestra and sinfonietta.She said of the win: "I really enjoyed performing tonight, even though I was very nervous before performing my first piece."The other competitors were very professional, friendly and it was great to get a chance to share a stage with them."When they announced my name as the winner, I could not believe my ears and I just couldn't stop smiling."With the scholarship money, I am going to use it towards a masters degree. I've seen a few courses that appeal in Europe and the USA and this money will enable me to pay for flights to auditions abroad."Judge Eirian Owen praised all six competitors, adding: "They were all experienced in their field and mature performers but the winner did stand out."Even though it was close, we were unanimous that Chloe was the winner."Chloe's technique on the flute is excellent. She is obviously a master at creating the fine sound of the flute and I'm sure that she will go far."The prize was established by opera singer Bryn Terfel in 1999 to nurture young singing talent in Wales and is open to winners of eight specified competitions at the Urdd National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts.</body>

      <body>Public consultation has started over a 25-mile (40km) pylon route linking planned wind farms in Powys to the national power supply in Shropshire.In addition to the pylons, National Grid has said eight miles (nearly 13km) of cables will be buried underground in the Meifod valley.Plans are to connect an electricity sub-station in Cefn Coch, near Llanfair Caereinion, to the supply network.The first of 26 drop-in sessions in Powys and Shropshire started on Monday.Britain's biggest ever public inquiry into wind farms started in Welshpool in June and could last for up to a year. It follows strong opposition to a number of planned wind farms in Powys.Revealing its pylon plans last month, National Grid said a new "T-pylon" - which is about 15m (nearly 50ft) shorter than conventional pylons - could be used along the power cable route which would be 33 miles (53km) long.The pylon route would start from the sub-station in Cefn Coch and finish at the national transmission network near Oswestry in Shropshire.National Grid said it had developed a draft route to keep away from villages and would use "hills and trees as a natural backdrop to help keep any visual impact to a minimum".About a quarter of the route would be underground, it added.The first three drop-in consultation sessions started at Llanfair Caereinion Public Institute on Monday. Two others at the institute will be held on Tuesday between 14:00 and 20:00 BST and Wednesday from 09:00 to 15:00 BST.Other sessions will be held in Adfa, near Newtown, Llansanffraid and Llanymynech, near Welshpool, West Felton Village Hall, near Oswestry, Shropshire and they end in Meifod, near Welshpool, on 8 November.More information about the consultation and where and when the the drop-in sessions are being staged is available on National Grid's website.</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <date>1381153697</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <date>1381091606</date>
      <body>Swansea City striker Michu has been called into the Spain squad for the first time for the decisive World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Georgia.He replaces David Villa after the Atletico Madrid forward injured his ankle in a 2-1 win against Celta Vigo.Michu joined the Swans for £2m in 2012 and hit 22 goals in his debut season.The 27-year-old was selected by Spain boss Vicente del Bosque ahead of Tottenham's Roberto Soldado and Juventus forward Fernando Llorente.Spain are guaranteed to finish in the top two of their group, along with France, but the 2010 winners need four points from their remaining two home games to be certain of qualifying.Belarus visit Palma on Friday night with Albacete hosting the game against Georgia four days later.La Rioja have already replaced Napoli defender Raul Albiol with Real Sociedad's Inigo Martinez and are without injured Chelsea striker Fernando Torres.Atletico Madrid's Brazil-born frontman Diego Costa has switched allegiance to Spain, but they are yet to receive clearance to play him.Del Bosque had suggested Michu would feature in Spain's friendly against Uruguay earlier this year but did not call him up.The former Rayo Vallecano striker helped Swansea win the League Cup success last season and the goal he scored at Crystal Palace in a 2-0 win last month was his fifth of the season.Spain squad:Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Victor Valdes (Barcelona), Pepe Reina (Napoli).Defenders: Alvaro Arbeloa (Real Madrid), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Barcelona), Inigo Martinez (Real Sociedad), Nacho Monreal (Arsenal), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid), Alberto Moreno (Sevilla).Midfielders: Andres Iniesta (Barcelona), Isco (Real Madrid), Koke (Atletico Madrid), Xavi (Barcelona), Mario Suarez (Atletico Madrid), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Juan Mata (Chelsea), David Silva (Manchester City).Forwards: Jesus Navas (Manchester City), Alvaro Negredo (Manchester City), Pedro (Barcelona), Michu (Swansea).</body>

      <body>A company which promised customers free boilers but failed to deliver them has shut, leaving customers £249 out of pocket.Eco Green Deal Solutions Ltd (EGDS) in Cardiff, made the offer under a UK government scheme for people on benefits but charged for its services.The Affordable Warmth scheme is free if customers call an official helpline.EGDS was run by Kris Patel, from Pontypool, Torfaen, who said he tried to keep customers informed.The company has vacated its offices at Caspian Point in Cardiff Bay.BBC Wales' consumer watchdog programme X-Ray found some customers were not eligible for the scheme but still charged up to £249 for arrangement and assessment fees.None of the customers who spoke to the programme received a boiler.Pensioner Noreen Riley, from Brackla near Bridgend, who was not eligible for the scheme because she did not receive benefits, said: "He told me they'd had a grant from the government and there was X-amount of money to be spent and this was part of it."Mrs Riley said she was sold the scheme personally by Mr Patel."I thought he was really a nice chap... but I don't think so now. I think I have been ripped off big time."Marenda Morgan, from Maesteg and who was also not eligible for the free services, said she waited months just to have an assessment."I paid the man £249 and he said an assessor will come in a fortnight and after that it will take about six weeks and everything will be done," she said.But four months later, Ms Morgan has only received an assessment which was not necessary for help under the scheme."They haven't got in touch with me," she said."I can't get through to any of the numbers I have for them."X-Ray attempted to contact ECO Green Deal Solutions but its phone lines were dead and receptionists at its former offices at Caspian Point have said the company has moved.The company remains registered as an active company and is not officially insolvent.Another company, operating from the same offices, called Diversity Network Ltd has provided refunds to two customers, including Mrs Riley, which it describe as a "gesture of goodwill".The company says it is completely independent of Eco Green Deal Solutions Ltd.Mr Patel, who runs Reliance General Stores in Sebastopol, Pontypool, refused to answer questions about the way his company operated but said he did try to keep customers informed.People affected by the scheme have been urged to contact Cardiff trading standards.X-Ray is on BBC One Wales at 19:30 BST on Monday, 7 October.</body>

      <body>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.Local councils have already been warned they will be exposed to more cuts than in previous years.A Welsh government source said ministers were preparing to deliver "the toughest budget since devolution".However, BBC Wales understands a budget deal with the opposition could be announced as early as Tuesday.Without an overall majority in the assembly, Labour will need an agreement from the opposition to approve its spending plans, worth about £15bn.John Rae, director of resources with the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We estimate we are facing cuts of around 4% after the local government minister warned us we'd be looking at English-style reductions."Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said there had been "a level of protection" to local government in Wales, and a study had shown that until now councils in Wales probably had taken "half the cut that councils in England had faced".He added that all the councils in Wales had their own priorities, but services in "discretionary areas" such as leisure, culture, planning, libraries, highways, street lights and economic development would be affected.The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for not protecting the health budget against inflation.Spending on the NHS has been frozen in recent years - meaning it has been cut in real terms after taking account of inflation.A review of the health budget was carried out over the summer.Speaking ahead of the draft budget, shadow finance minister Paul Davies AM criticised the situation in the NHS in Wales where "patients are routinely waiting over four hours to be seen in AandE".He added: "For the sake of our NHS, Carwyn Jones must use this draft budget to reverse Labour's damaging health cuts."In the last two years, Labour has done separate budget deals with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.This year, Plaid and the Lib Dems have joined forces to negotiate a deal with the government.An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said the UK government's block grant to Wales in 2013/14 would be around 9.4% smaller in real terms than it was in 2010/11.More cuts announced for the two years after that would take the reduction to 12.2%.</body>

      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <body>Language campaigners say they will start a campaign of non-violent direct action unless government policies to protect Welsh are put in place.The motion with a deadline of February 2014 was passed at the Welsh Language Society's (Cymdeithas Yr Iaith's) annual meeting in Carno, Powys.The 2011 census figures showed a drop in the number of Welsh speakers.The Welsh government said it was committed to seeing the language prosper.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Cymdeithas must understand that those in government are as committed to growing the Welsh language and increasing the number of Welsh speakers as they are."This is not the 1960s or 70s."Welsh Language Society chairman Robin Farrar said: "Nearly a year has passed since we saw the results of the census, and since then there has been a lot of talk and discussion about the situation regarding the language."There is by now a consensus that the Welsh language is facing an emergency and that we need big policy changes."We have said since the publication of the census results that we can't sit back and accept the consequences, with positive campaigning and political will we can change our destiny and the destinies of our Welsh language communities."If the government refuses to act on the six points we have outlined we will take direct but non-violent action."We have drawn up a list of people who are willing to act - campaigns like this have worked in the past and we're ready to do it again."The Welsh government spokesperson added: "We are committed to promoting the Welsh language and since the census results we have been taking action. "He said measures included a national conversation on the language, which gave everyone a chance to have their say on how best to secure its future."We have commissioned a number of reviews and studies, and will be receiving their reports soon. This autumn we will also be launching an information campaign for Welsh medium education."Meanwhile, we will be working with all those with an interest in the language to ensure it continues to thrive throughout Wales."</body>

      <body>Wing Alex Cuthbert says Cardiff Blues' victory over Edinburgh was a boost ahead of their Heineken Cup campaign.The Wales and British and Irish Lions wing crossed for two tries in the 29-12 win over Edinburgh in the Pro12.The Blues open their Heineken Cup Pool 2 campaign with a trip to Exeter on Sunday, 13 October."Hopefully, this can kick-start our season and it's a good confidence boost going into the Heineken Cup," said Cuthbert."We got what we wanted and that was the win. The main aim was to get a win and to try and put a performance in as well."We built and the first half was a bit slow for us but we got our rewards in the second half."We showed a little of what we can do against Leinster last weekend. We wanted to carry that on and go one step further and get a win, which we did."It was a good performance and we are all confident and need a good training week going into the Exeter game."The Blues have managed only two wins in their opening five games and became the first team to be beaten by new Italian outfit Zebre in the Pro12.Coach Phil Davies saw his side bounce back with an improved display in Dublin in the 34-20 defeat to Pro12 champions Leinster.Now the Blues turn their focus to Europe for the next few weeks and they are in the same pool as the Chiefs, Glasgow Warriors and reigning Heineken Cup champions Toulon.Cuthbert is looking forward to his personal duel with former Blues winger Tom James, who now plays for the Chiefs."I have watched them a little bit over the last couple of weeks and they have a good forward pack and have the likes of Tom James on the wing," said Cuthbert."He is playing well for them and, if selected, it will be a good battle with him."We have to do some homework this week, but just think about ourselves and what we can do in the game."</body>

      <body>Wales boss Chris Coleman has called up nine players as injury cover for the World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium.Adam Matthews, Ben Davies, Gareth Bale, Danny Gabbidon, Sam Ricketts, Jack Collison, Joe Allen and Joe Ledley have been ruled out.Uncapped Southampton midfielder Lloyd Isgrove, 20, comes in.Owain Tudur Jones, Daniel Alfei, James Wilson, Rhoys Wiggins, Jermaine Easter and Shaun MacDonald are recalled.David Cotterill and Jazz Richards also return to international duty as Coleman plugs gaps created by injuries and Andrew Crofts' suspension.Bale was an early withdrawal, having made three appearances since his record move to Real Madrid.Davies suffered a suspected hamstring injury late in Swansea's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on Sunday, while Matthews hurt his collarbone playing for Celtic and Gabbidon (hamstring) missed Crystal Palace's trip to Liverpool at the weekend.Gabbidon's team-mate Jonathan Williams is another injury absentee, adding to the problems in midfield with Allen, Ledley and Crofts all missing.Swansea's Ashley Williams is in the squad, although the captain remains a fitness concern with an ankle injury, but fellow centre-back James Collins is left out.Newcastle United defender Paul Dummett could have been considered for his first senior cap, but the Wales Under-21 player has injured a hamstring.Wales go into Friday's clash against Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium bottom of Group A and travel to leaders Belgium on Tuesday, 15 October.Coleman's side have six points from eight games, leading to speculation over Coleman's future as Wales boss.He is still in negotiations to extend his deal beyond the qualifying campaign and Football Association of Wales  chief executive Jonathan Ford has hinted much could depend on the next two results in the next two World Cup qualifiers.He has also had to contend with controversy surrounding the absence of West Ham United's Collins.After the 3-0 defeat against Serbia in Cardiff on 10 September, Coleman was critical Collins, saying the player had rejected the chance to join the squad before the game, a claim Collins denies.Craig Bellamy has been included for what are likely to be his final competitive games for the Dragons.The veteran Cardiff forward has said he is unlikely to take part in the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.W Hennessey (Wolves), B Myhill (West Brom), O Fon Williams (Tranmere), C Gunter (Reading), N Taylor (Swansea), A Williams (Swansea), D Alfei (Swansea), J Wilson (Bristol City), R Wiggins (Charlton), A Richards (Huddersfield), D John (Cardiff), A King (Leicester), A Ramsey (Arsenal), D Vaughan (Sunderland), L Isgrove (Southampton), O Tudur Jones (Hibernian), S MacDonald (Bournemouth), D Cotterill (Doncaster), C Bellamy (Cardiff), S Church (Charlton), H Robson-Kanu (Reading), S Vokes (Burnley), J Easter (Crystal Palace).Wales Under-21 squad (against Lithuania on 11 October, 14:00 BST and San Marino on 15 October, 14:00 BST at the BookPeople Stadium, Bangor): Connor Roberts (Cheltenham Town), Danny Ward (Liverpool), Morgan Fox (Charlton Athletic), Kieron Freeman (Derby County), Elliott Hewitt (Ipswich Town), George Ray (Crewe Alexandra), Scott Tancock (Swansea City), Joe Walsh (Crawley Town), Billy Bodin (Torquay United), Lee Evans (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Lloyd Isgrove (Southampton), Lee Lucas (Swansea City), Josh Pritchard (Fulham, Tromso loan), Tom Bradshaw (Shrewsbury Town), Wes Burns (Bristol City), Ellis Harrison (Bristol Rovers), Tom Lawrence (Manchester United), Tom O'Sullivan (Cardiff City).</body>

      <title>Wrexham finding it tough - Morrell</title>
      <description>Player-manager Andy Morrell says Wrexham's current run of poor form without a win in four game is tough to deal with.</description>

      <body>Player-manager Andy Morrell says he is finding Wrexham's current poor run of results in the Conference Premier tough to deal with.He saw his side suffer a 2-1 defeat away to Salisbury on Saturday, making it four games without a win.Wrexham face Southport at the Racecourse Ground on Tuesday, with Morrell needing a victory to ease the pressure on his side."It is hard and it's tough," said Morrell."There are a lot of decisions to be made and I think about things all the time. You cannot get away from it."Morrell has already had to hear fans booing his side during the 3-2 home defeat against Braintree in September.Last season's beaten Play-Off finalists are struggling to find any kind of form during this campaign.Wrexham missed out on promotion back to the Football League when they lost the Play-Off final to Newport last season.But Morrell and his side now find themselves at the wrong end of the Conference table in 20th place and the Dragons current record reads won three, lost seven and drawn three so far this campaign.Morrell says he is trying to set the right example for his players and is positive Wrexham can end their run of poor form."I have to be positive and have a plan to beat Southport," said Morrell."They (players) are looking to me for an olive branch and be a guide to follow."I am trying to do that and let them see my enthusiasm. Hopefully, that will rub off on them."Hopefully, they will stand up and be counted and do everything they can to win a football match."We just lack a bit of confidence. This league is good because games come thick and fast and you have a chance to put things right straight away."</body>

      <body>Bydd Llywodraeth Cymru'n cyhoeddi ei chyllideb ddrafft ar gyfer y flwyddyn ariannol 2014-15 ddydd Mawrth.Mae disgwyl y cyhoeddiad gan y Gweinidog Cyllid Jane Hutt tua 3:00yh.I lywodraeth sy'n ceisio cael dau ben llinyn ynghyd mewn cyfnod o grebachu ariannol ers dechrau'r degawd, mae'n dalcen caled gan fod yr arbedion "hawdd" eisoes wedi cael eu gwneud.Dros y misoedd diwethaf, mae newid wedi bod yn agwedd gweinidogion wrth iddyn nhw sylweddoli y bydd y toriadau'n parhau tan 2017 a thu hwnt.Felly beth allwn ni ddisgwyl o'r gyllideb ddrafft?Fel arfer bydd y chwyddwydr ar wariant ar y Gwasanaeth Iechyd Gwladol yng Nghymru. Yn y blynyddoedd diweddar, dyw'r GIG ddim wedi gweld cynnydd mawr yn y setliad, sy'n golygu bod chwyddiant wedi erydu grym gwario'r gwasanaeth flwyddyn ar ôl blwyddyn.Wedi haf o benawdau siomedig a thargedau'n cael eu methu, y teimlad nawr yw bod rhaid canfod yr arian i gynyddu cyllideb iechyd y wlad.Ond beth fydd cost hynny? Dyma beth yw gwariant Llywodraeth Cymru fesul adran ar hyn o bryd :-Mae mwyafrif llethol gwariant y llywodraeth felly wedi ei rannu rhwng dwy adran gydag iechyd y mwyaf o dipyn. Byddai unrhyw gynnydd sylweddol mewn gwariant ar iechyd yn debyg o gael effaith mewn adrannau eraill, a llywodraeth leol sy'n paratoi am newyddion drwg ddydd Mawrth.Daeth awgrym o doriadau i gyllidebau cynghorau mewn araith gan y Gweinidog Llywodraeth Leol Lesley Griffiths i gynhadledd flynyddol Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru ym mis Mehefin eleni, pan ddywedodd nad yw'r warchodaeth y mae cynghorau Cymru wedi ei gael o gymharu â chynghorau Lloegr yn gynaliadwy.Bydd hyn yn golygu penderfyniadau anodd mewn neuaddau sir ar draws Cymru, a gan fod cynghorau wedi cael eu gorchymyn i warchod gwariant ar ysgolion a gofal cymdeithasol, mae'r fwyell yn sicr o ddisgyn ar bethau fel hamdden, priffyrdd a gwasanaethau diwylliannol.Ond cyllideb ddrafft yw hon, felly pa obaith sydd gan Llywodraeth Cymru o berswadio'r Cynulliad i gymeradwyo'r gyllideb?Heb fwyafrif yn y Cynulliad, maen nhw wedi gorfod dod i gytundeb gydag un o'r pleidiau eraill er mwyn cymeradwyo cyllidebau'r blynyddoedd diweddar.Eleni mae Plaid Cymru a'r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol wedi cytuno i gynnal trafodaethau ar y cyd, a gyda Carwyn Jones yn gwrthod unrhyw gytundeb gyda'r Ceidwadwyr ar egwyddor, does fawr o ddewis ar ôl gan ei lywodraeth.Mewn blynyddoedd diweddar, mae trafodaethau am y gyllideb wedi para am wythnosau ar ôl cyhoeddi'r gyllideb ddrafft, ond mae'n ymddangos y tro hwn bod Bae Caerdydd wedi dangos mwy o aeddfedrwydd gwleidyddol. Yn dilyn adroddiadau o drafodaethau adeiladol gydol yr haf, mae'n bosib y gwelwn ni gyhoeddiad rhywbryd heddiw am gytundeb rhwng Llafur, Plaid Cymru a'r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol.Sicrhau pleidleisiau i basio'r gyllideb fydd y rhan hawdd o'r gwaith. Bydd sicrhau bod y GIG yn gwneud y gorau o unrhyw arian ychwanegol, a chefnogi llywodraeth leol drwy effeithiau'r hyn sy'n debygol o fod y toriadau lwyaf llym yn oes wleidyddol y mwyafrif o gynghorwyr yn anoddach o lawer.</body>

      <title>Analysis: Axe over council budgets</title>
      <description>Local government braced for tough settlement</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24432008</url>
      <date>1381169538</date>
      <body>With the Welsh government set to publish its draft budget for 2014-15 on Tuesday, BBC News examines the prospects for public services in the coming year.Austerity has been with us since the turn of the decade - but these really are the hard yards now for those charged with balancing the nation's books.The kind of simpler savings sometimes characterised as "low hanging fruit" are largely gone.There's a noticeable change of tone from ministers in recent months, and a realisation that the cuts will just keep coming, to 2017 and probably beyond.So what can we expect from Tuesday's draft budget? As always, the spending on the Welsh NHS will be under microscopic scrutiny.It's faced "cash flat" budget settlements in recent years, meaning that inflation has eroded actual spending power year on year. After a summer of dismal headlines and missed targets, the feeling is that something has had to give and that extra money may be found.But at what cost? Here is a breakdown of the Welsh government's spending by department:So the vast majority of Welsh government spending is split between two departments - health and local government, with health by a margin the largest.Any substantial increase in health spending is going to to have serious knock on impact elsewhere - and it's local government which is bracing itself for Tuesday's announcement.The deeper cuts in council budgets were signalled in a speech by Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths to the Welsh Local Government Association annual conference in June this year, where she said that the relative protection Welsh councils had enjoyed compared to their English counterparts since austerity began can no longer be sustained.It means much tougher decisions in town halls up and down Wales from here on in - and since councils have been told to protect spending on schools and social care (their biggest ticket items) the axe will fall on areas such as leisure, highways and cultural services in a way not experienced by people so far.What are the prospects for the Welsh government to get its own tough decisions on spending through the National Assembly this time round?Without an overall majority, they've needed to do deals with other parties so far to get their budgets through.This year, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have joined forces to negotiate together, and with Carwyn Jones ruling out any deal with the Conservatives on principle, it's meant that his options have been significantly limited.In previous years, negotiations have dragged on for weeks after the draft budget has been published. But - whisper it quietly - there appears to have been an outbreak of political maturity in Cardiff Bay.Following what are reported as constructive discussions ongoing through the summer, we could see a comprehensive deal announced as early as today between Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.But getting the votes to pass the budget will be the easy part.Making sure the health service makes the most of any extra cash and supporting local government through the knock on impacts of what are likely to be the deepest cuts in most councillors' political lifetimes will be a far bigger struggle.</body>

      <title>Dylan Thomas Prize writers announced</title>
      <description>Record number on Dylan Thomas writing prize shortlist</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-24427663</url>
      <date>1381146313</date>
      <body>A record number of writers have been shortlisted for this year's Dylan Thomas Prize because of the strength of the entries, say judges.Seven debut works - three novels, two poetry books and two short story collections - are vying for the £30,000 award, which started in 2006.The Swansea-based prize normally features a shortlist of five or six.The award is given to an author of a novel, play, poetry or travel book in the English language who is under 30.The winner will be announced in November.Judging panel chair Peter Florence said: "We had such a strong shortlist this year that we had to include a seventh title, as they are all contenders."In all my years on the judging panel of the prize, I've never seen a higher standard of entry from young writers."Next year sees the centenary celebration of Swansea-born writer Thomas, whose global success was the catalyst for the launch of the prize.It celebrates the legacy of a poet who wrote most of his work in his 20s.It was set up initially as a biennial award - one of the world's highest paying literary prizes for young writers under 30.Since then, the judges claim it has become a reliable guide to the best new literary talent by unearthing and recognising young writers from around the world.The prize's chair, Peter Stead, said: "The seven books on this year's shortlist indicate the truly international scope of the Dylan Thomas Prize."There are two young poets - one English, one Welsh - and five prose writers from around the world whose stories take us to Nepal, war-torn Sudan, South Africa, Nevada and the Near East of Classical times."These are amazingly and accomplished books by writers who are all under 30 and who will be coming to Swansea to speak to aspiring young writers and to hear the judging panel's choice of winner."The first winner was Rhondda writer Rachel Tresize, and her successors include Nam Le, a Vietnamese-born writer based in New York, Belfast writer Lucy Caldwell, and last year's winner Maggie Shipstead from California.The 2013 prize judges include Hay Festival founder Mr Florence; author, singer and radio presenter Cerys Matthews; journalist and author Carolyn Hitt; and University of Texas English professor Kurt Heinzelman.In addition to the prize money, the winner is also presented with a bronze cast of a young Dylan Thomas at the awards ceremony in Swansea.</body>

      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <title>Army robot refuses to be pushed over</title>
      <description>US military-funded Boston Dynamics is developing astonishingly realistic animal and humanoid robots that can cross rough terrain, balance and gallop.</description>

      <body>Meet Atlas, a humanoid robot capable of crossing rough terrain and maintaining its balance on one leg even when hit from the side.And WildCat, the four-legged robot that can gallop untethered at up to 16mph (26km/h).These are the latest creations of Boston Dynamics, a US robotics company part-funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The robots are part of Darpa's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation programme.Darpa says such robots "hold great promise for amplifying human effectiveness in defence operations".Referring to Atlas's ability to remain balanced despite being hit by a lateral weight, Noel Sharkey, professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC: "This is an astonishing achievement... quite a remarkable feat."This version of Atlas is one of seven humanoid robots Boston Dynamics is developing in response to the Darpa Robotics Challenge.In December, competing robots will be set eight tasks to test their potential for use in emergency-response situations, including crossing uneven ground, using power tools and driving a rescue vehicle.Darpa wants to improve the manoeuvrability and controllability of such robots while reducing manufacturing costs.WildCat can bound, gallop and turn, mimicking the movements of quadruped animals. It is powered by an internal combustion engine."It is a shame that such technology is not being developed with other research funding," said Prof Sharkey, who is also chair of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control."We do not know what military purpose it will serve but certainly it is a step towards a high-speed ground robot that could be weaponised to hunt and kill."The video shows WildCat performing on a flat surface, but Prof Sharkey said: "It would be good to see how well it could perform in a muddy field."Last year, Boston Dynamics' Cheetah robot reached a sprint speed of 28.3mph tethered to a treadmill.Geoff Pegman, managing director of RURobots, told the BBC: "Robotics has been making important strides in recent years, and these are a couple of demonstrations of the technology moving forward."However, their application may be limited to areas such as defence and, maybe specialised construction or demolition tasks."In other applications there are more efficient ways of achieving the mobility more cost effectively."</body>

      <title>LG announces curved screen phones</title>
      <description>LG says it is about to start mass-producing flexible screens for smartphones ahead of the roll-out of new handsets in 2014.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24426744</url>
      <date>1381157495</date>
      <body>LG has announced it is to start mass-production of what it calls the "world's first flexible OLED [organic light-emitting diode] panel for smartphones".The South Korean firm said it hoped to start selling the first handsets to feature the tech next year.The news comes weeks after Samsung made a similar announcement.Samsung said it intended to launch its first product - a special edition of the Galaxy Note 3 - later this month.Both companies already use the technology to offer curved OLED television sets.Although the displays used in the TVs are in theory "flexible", they are mounted in fixed shells so they cannot be bent or otherwise re-shaped by the owner.A press release from LG's display division indicated its handset screen would curve from top-to-bottom rather than side-to-side, the design Samsung described in a recent patent.It said the advantage of using the tech was that the panel was "bendable and unbreakable"."The new display is vertically concave from top to bottom with a radius of 700mm [28in], opening up a world of design innovations in the smartphone market," LG added."What's more, it is also the world's lightest, weighing a mere 7.2g [0.25oz] even with a 6in screen, the largest among current smartphone OLED displays."One industry watcher was not convinced the product, as described, would have much appeal."I think LG is doing this to show it is innovative, to do something different and to stand out from the rest of the bar-style screen devices that we have at the moment," said David McQueen, a mobile device expert at tech consultants Informa."But I don't think consumers are going to be that interested by a slightly curved design."However, we do think there will be interest if flexible screens are used to offer different form factors."For example a device that you snap round your wrist or a traditional shaped smartphone whose screen wraps around the sides onto a bit of the back so that the edges become touchscreen rather than hard buttons."</body>

      <title>Euro MPs vote on anti-tobacco rules</title>
      <description>The European Parliament is to vote on tougher tobacco regulations especially aimed at preventing younger people from taking up smoking.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381219629</date>
      <body>Euro MPs will vote shortly on new measures aimed at putting young people off smoking, including bigger health warnings on cigarette packets and restrictions on electronic cigarettes.Under the draft legislation from the European Commission e-cigarettes would become a medicinal product.Menthol cigarettes could be banned, along with other flavoured tobacco.Packs of 10 as well as slim cigarettes - marketed mainly to women - would no longer be sold.Smaller packs are reckoned to be more attractive to young smokers.It is the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on chewing tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.Once agreed, all 28 EU countries will have to make the measures law.After Tuesday's vote there will be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives and should not be restricted because they could dramatically reduce smoking-related diseases.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking."Tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products," said EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg, presenting the proposals.The current requirement for health warnings on packets is 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.The new packaging requirements would also apply to roll-your-own tobacco.The legislation would allow member states the option of plain, non-branded packaging "in duly justified cases".The Commission says packets must be big enough to ensure full visibility for the health warnings, so the recommendation is at least 20 cigarettes per pack.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. It is argued that bigger, more expensive packets are less attractive to young smokers.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The associated costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <title>UK jumps up net-access scoreboard</title>
      <description>The UK has joined the top 10 best connected nations according to a UN study, but the organisation is warning of a digital divide as developing nations lag behind.</description>

      <date>1381148492</date>
      <body>The UK has moved up the UN's net-connectivity table, leapfrogging Hong Kong and Japan to take eighth place.South Korea topped the list for the third year in a row. Niger and the Central African Republic came in last.Officials forecast that almost 40% of the world's population would be online by the end of the year.But they warned that the relative high cost of net access in developing countries was restricting uptake and causing a "digital divide".They said 90% of the globe's 1.1 billion households not yet connected to the net were in the developing world, and highlighted a group of 39 countries - most of which are in Africa - they said were not making enough progress to roll out information and communications technologies (ICT).As a result, they warned that at current growth rates it was unlikely that the UN Broadband Commission's 2015 targets for global internet use would be achieved.The ICT Development Index is based on 11 indicators measuring internet access, use and skills.It is compiled on an annual basis by the International Telecommunication Union - a United Nations agency dedicated to expanding connectivity.Its 2012 report noted that a high level of competition had helped the UK rise up its scoreboard, with the country enjoying some of the world's cheapest fixed and mobile broadband rates, based on a comparison of subscription costs versus income.It noted that 80% of all UK households had had an internet connection at the end of last year - more than double the global rate.Across the world it said 250 million people had joined the net in 2012 and it forecast a total of 2.7 billion people would be using it by the end of this year.However, it added, that would still leave 4.4 billion people offline.Part of the problem, the ITU said, was the issue of affordability.Buying fixed-broadband cost on average 30% of gross national income per capita in developing countries, it said. In other words, nearly a third of the average wage.In half of all African countries the level was even higher with fixed-broadband costing more than 40% of the average wage.It acknowledged that mobile phone data was usually more affordable, but said there were exceptions - in Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sao Tome and Principe buying 500MB of data for use on a handset cost more than 100% of the average monthly wage.By contrast, Malaysia was singled out for praise for running a smartphone money-back initiative for the under-30s and investing heavily in getting schools online."Our most pressing challenge is to identify ways to enable those countries which are still struggling to connect their populations to deploy the networks and services which will lift them out of poverty," said Hamadoun Toure, the ITU's secretary general.The UN's official target is that the cost of accessing the net falls below 5% of a country's average monthly wage.To help achieve that goal a group of private and public sector organisations has launched a coalition to coincide with the ITU's report.The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) is the brainchild of the World Wide Web Foundation, and aims to pressure countries to change the ways they allocate spectrum and promote infrastructure-sharing efforts in order to force prices down.Google, Facebook, Intel, Yahoo, Microsoft, the US State Department and the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women are among its sponsors."The reason for the alliance is simple - the majority of the world's people are still not online, usually because they can't afford to be," said Sir Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web Foundation."In Mozambique, for example, a recent study showed that using just one gigabyte of data can cost well over two months' wages for the average citizen."The result of high prices is a widening digital divide that slows progress in vital areas such as health, education and science."The real bottleneck now is anti-competitive policies that keep prices unaffordable. The alliance is about removing that barrier and helping as many as possible get online at reasonable cost."</body>

      <title>NSA targeted Tor via Firefox flaw</title>
      <description>The NSA allegedly used a security hole in older versions of the Firefox web browser in an attempt to undermine the Tor online anonymity service, reports say.</description>

      <body>The NSA attempted to monitor Tor users by using security holes in the Firefox web browser, according to reports.The US agency broke into computers to try to look at Tor anonymous communications, documents leaked by Edward Snowden have suggested.The National Security Agency (NSA) had difficulty in undermining the encrypted Tor service itself, they said.A security expert said the NSA appeared not to have yet managed to crack Tor.US signals intelligence agency the NSA, and its UK counterpart GCHQ, have been involved in long-term efforts to try to undermine the Tor online anonymity service, according to leaked documents published by the Guardian newspaper.The NSA and GCHQ have been implicated in spying on mass communications in a number of documents leaked by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.Tor (The Onion Router) tries to hide user identities, and the websites that people are looking at, by routing encrypted internet traffic through a number of volunteer computers.One of the ways the NSA tried to get around Tor encryption was to infect Tor users' computers instead, according to a Guardian report.The leaked document, called "Tor Stinks", said that the NSA had no success in revealing Tor communications between criminal suspects.Nevertheless, the agency had managed to "de-anonymise a very small fraction of Tor users".The document outlined different avenues the NSA had explored, including placing small pieces of data called cookies on users' machines.The agency also suggested slowing down communications over Tor using its own network of computers running Tor.The NSA has the ability to "stain" people's website traffic as it enters Tor, and to identify it as it leaves, according to leaked documents published by the Washington Post.The NSA allegedly infected computers in an attempt to look at web traffic at both ends of the encrypted Tor communication path, rather than decrypt the path itself.The agency used links with US telecoms companies to sift vast amounts of internet data and identify traffic from computers connecting to Tor, the report said.Once the users' machines were identified, the NSA allegedly used secret internet servers, codenamed FoxAcid, to infect the computers with malicious software.The NSA used software called EgotisticalGiraffe to attack vulnerable older versions of the Firefox web browser, the report said.Firefox is included in a bundle of software provided to get users up and running with Tor.The Tor service is intended for legitimate use by people in repressive regimes, but law enforcement agencies have been concerned that Tor can hide criminal and terrorist activity.The US government published a statement on Friday saying that its interest in Tor and other means of online communication "is based on the undeniable fact that these are the tools our adversaries use to communicate and co-ordinate attacks against the United States and our allies".Security expert Steven Murdoch said it was "strangely comforting" that the NSA had not managed to crack Tor."Tor seems not to be the weakest link," said Mr Murdoch, a Cambridge University researcher who contributes to the Tor Project."It looks like the weakest link is software on people's computers, in this case, older versions of Firefox," he said.</body>

      <title>BBC 'to launch personalised iPlayer'</title>
      <description>The BBC's director general Tony Hall is expected to announce the next generation iPlayer in a keynote speech on Tuesday.</description>

      <date>1381143897</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general Tony Hall is expected to announce the launch of the next generation BBC iPlayer in a keynote speech on Tuesday.It is understood he will explain his vision for an enhanced iPlayer, allowing users to personalise their viewing and listening choices.The iPlayer, launched in 2007, provides a catch-up service for BBC TV and radio programmes.The speech is Lord Hall's first since his joining speech in April.Entitled Where Next?, Lord Hall's speech will discuss the technological challenges facing the BBC, as more people turn to the internet via mobile phones and tablets to watch TV.As part of this focus, BBC Radio 1 has announced it is going to get its own channel on the iPlayer.The station said this will allow fans to watch exclusive performances and interviews not broadcast anywhere else.It is hoped that the channel will help Radio 1 reach more young people.Content will include music featured in Radio 1's Live Lounge and at the annual Big Weekend festival as well as interviews with celebrities and artists from around the world.But as the iPlayer becomes more bespoke for each user, media commentators have already begun to question the validity of the fixed licence fee paid by the public.Writing in the Guardian on Sunday, Steve Hewlett wrote: "One question that must surely arise in the unbundled 'My BBC' world is, once I've picked out the bits of the BBC I use and value, why should I pay for the rest?"And because the technology of on-demand delivery that underpins the whole project allows subscription in a way that broadcast TV and radio don't - at least not easily - 'My BBC' will inevitably in time reignite the question of subscription funding, for some BBC services at least."Lord Hall will also announce the launch of an app for mobile phones and tablets to allow listeners to hear their favourite radio programmes in one place.The app will showcase new pieces of content each day. Users will be able to choose what they want to hear and when they want to hear it.In time, users will be able to personalise their choices, with the app suggesting programmes they may like depending on their interests and the time they have available.It will feature programmes from stations including BBC Radio 4, Radio 3 and the World Service.Director of BBC Radio Helen Boaden said: "Listeners will get outstanding programmes from brilliant brains in a way which fits into their packed lives."A launch is planned in 2014, with content available both in the UK and internationally.In Tuesday's speech, Lord Hall will also flesh out the details of a 20% increase in funding for the BBC's arts coverage.The director general - who used to run the Royal Opera House - is keen to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand, while two new television series will be fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr respectively.Lord Hall also wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.The director general is expected to unveil new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.The announcements are part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and come as the corporation is in the process of cutting 2,000 jobs by 2017 after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <body>Lord Sugar has been investigated by police after he was accused of posting a racist message on Twitter.The businessman and star of The Apprentice posted a photo of a child apparently of Chinese origin crying.He wrote: "The kid in the middle is upset because he was told off for leaving the production line of the iPhone 5."Merseyside Police said it had investigated a complaint but said "no criminal offences" had taken place.Lord Sugar's spokesman said he would not be commenting on the complaint.Liverpool shop owner Nichola Szeto had taken offence about the reference to the Asian factories where the mobile phones are produced and complained about the "racist tweet" to the Metropolitan Police.She was then contacted by Merseyside Police and went to a Liverpool police station to make a statement about the tweet, which was posted on 30 September.A police spokesman said: "Merseyside Police can confirm officers received a complaint in relation to the tweet sent on the evening of Sunday September 30."The communication has been examined by the force's specialist hate crime investigation team and at this time it has been recorded as a hate incident and no criminal offences have taken place."Officers from the specialist team will be contacting the person who made the initial complaint to discuss this."</body>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <date>1380895882</date>
      <body>Cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism.They stick together using magnets.The scientists envisage miniaturised "swarmbot" versions self-assembling like the "liquid steel" androids in the Terminator films.More realistically, the researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), believe armies of such cubes could be used for making temporary repairs to bridges or buildings, or as self-assembly, re-configurable scaffolding.Modular robots have the advantage of being able to adapt to whatever task or terrain is presented to them.John Romanishin, one of the research scientists at CSAIL leading the project, said: "We want hundreds of cubes, scattered randomly across the floor, to be able to identify each other, coalesce, and autonomously transform into a chair, or a ladder, or a desk, on demand."The M-Blocks are currently controlled by computer instructions sent over wireless radio, but in future the researchers hope algorithms can be loaded on the blocks directly, making them entirely autonomous and capable of adapting to different environments.Blocks equipped with sensors and cameras would be able to work out how to accomplish specific tasks in combat or emergency situations, the scientists hope.</body>

      <body>Adobe has confirmed that 2.9 million customers have had private information stolen during a "sophisticated" cyber attack on its website.The attackers accessed encrypted customer passwords and payment card numbers, the company said.But it does not believe decrypted debit or credit card data was removed.Adobe also revealed that it was investigating the "illegal access" of source code for numerous products, including Adobe Acrobat and ColdFusion."We deeply regret that this incident occurred," said Brad Arkin, Adobe's chief security officer."Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident," he said.But Chester Wisniewski, senior adviser at internet security company Sophos, told the BBC: "Access to the source code could be very serious."Billions of computers around the world use Adobe software, so if hackers manage to embed malicious code in official-looking software updates they could potentially take control of millions of machines."This is on the same level as a Microsoft security breach," he added.Adobe said it had been helped in its investigation by internet security journalist Brian Krebs and security expert Alex Holden.The two discovered a 40GB cache of Adobe source code while investigating attacks on three US data providers, Dun and Bradstreet, Kroll Background America, and LexisNexis.Mr Krebs said the Adobe code was on a server he believed the hackers used.Adobe said that it is resetting passwords for the customer accounts it believes were compromised, and that those customers will get an email alerting them to the change.It is also recommending that, as a precaution, customers affected change their passwords and user information for other websites for which they used the same ID.For those US customers whose debit or credit card information is suspected of being accessed, Adobe is offering a complimentary one-year subscription to a credit-monitoring programme.Finally, the company said it had notified law enforcement officials and is working to identify the hackers.</body>

      <body>More than two million people in China are employed by the government to monitor web activity, state media say, providing a rare glimpse into how the state tries to control the internet.The Beijing News says the monitors, described as internet opinion analysts, are on state and commercial payrolls.China's hundreds of millions of web users increasingly use microblogs to criticise the state or vent anger.Recent research suggested Chinese censors actively target social media.The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings.They are "strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work.Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works."He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients."He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers (them) and compile reports and send them to the clients," it says.The reports says the software used in the office is even more advanced and supported by thousands of servers. It also monitors websites outside China.China rarely reveals any details concerning the scale and sophistication of its internet police force.It is believed that the two million internet monitors are part of a huge army which the government relies on to control the internet.The government is also to organise training classes for them for the first time from 14 to 18 October, the paper says.But it is not clear whether the training will be for existing monitors or for new recruits.The training will have eight modules, and teach participants how to analyse and judge online postings and deal with crisis situations, it says.The most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, launched in 2010, now has more than 500 million registered users with 100 million messages posted daily.Topics cover a wide range - from personal hobbies, health to celebrity gossip and food safety but they talso include politically sensitive issues like official corruption.Postings deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted.</body>

      <body>Thirteen alleged members of hacktivist group Anonymous have been indicted, accused of carrying out cyber-attacks.They have been charged in the US with conspiring to intentionally cause damage to protected computers.They were said to have targeted firms that refused to process payments for WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site founded by Julian Assange.The group flooded services with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to overwhelm the sites.This method - known as a Distributed Denial of Service attack, or DDoS - is a typical tactic of the hacktivist movement.The accused allegedly targeted groups or businesses they felt did not share the philosophy of Anonymous to make all information free for everyone, regardless of copyright laws or national security considerations.Those hit included governments, trade associations, law firms and financial institutions.Court documents said that from September 2010 to January 2011, Anonymous members waged a campaign they dubbed Operation Payback.In December 2010, the conspirators are alleged to have discussed possible targets related to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site that struggled to receive funding after several payment processing companies, including Mastercard and Visa, refused to facilitate the transfer of donations to the group.The Swedish prosecutor's office was also hit, in connection with arrest warrants for sexual crimes issued for Mr Assange.The accused were also said to have gone after music industry bodies in retaliation for action taken against The Pirate Bay, a Sweden-based file sharing website devoted to the illegal downloading of copyrighted material.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>

      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <title>Fury over Sindh messaging ban plan</title>
      <description>Internet freedom activists in Pakistan express anger over proposals by Sindh province to ban messaging apps including Skype for three months.</description>

      <date>1380885579</date>
      <body>Internet freedom activists in Pakistan have expressed anger over proposals by the government of Sindh province to ban messaging apps including Skype, Viber and WhatsApp for three months.The provincial government says the move is necessary as a security measure.It says the move "detaches criminals from modern communication means".But the proposal has to be approved by the central government before it is implemented and so far no decision has been taken.Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan has said that he was not in favour of such a move."But I will go through the Sindh government's application in favour of the ban to see how much weight it carries," Mr Khan was quoted by local media as saying.Scores of social media users have condemned the proposals arguing that they are infringements of personal freedom and will impede small businesses and entrepreneurs from working effectively."The ban on Skype, Viber and WhatsApp in Sindh is a cyber-drone attack from the government," social media user Umer Pirzada tweeted.Another critic wrote: "This is when you know the country has gone down the drain. Blocking WhatsApp, Skype, What's next? Blocking oxygen?"But senior Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has spoken out in favour of the move arguing on Twitter that it was necessary to "catch some terrorists and save some lives".Sindh has been plagued by serious militant, sectarian and criminal violence throughout 2013 with the port city of Karachi being especially badly hit.Technology experts have pointed out that the proposed restrictions may be doomed to failure because they could easily be circumvented by criminals.Correspondents says that Pakistan's mobile network has been switched off about 12 times over the last year.Former PPP Interior Minister Rehman Malik frequently shut down cellular networks for extended periods on important national and religious holidays to "ensure the safety of the people".A ban on video sharing website YouTube - deemed by the authorities to be blasphemous - was introduced by the central government in September 2012.</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101</url>
      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off.The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <body>The only British team to qualify for a solar car race in Australia has been forced to pull out after its vehicle crashed just days before the start.The Cambridge University Eco Racing car, Resolution, was expected to take part in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, but crashed on Tuesday.The team hoped to fix it before the start, but withdrew on Saturday.In a statement, the team said: "We have not been able to reassure ourselves of the safety of our solar drivers."Resolution was one of 28 vehicles entered in the Challenger category of the 1,860-mile (3,000km), seven-day race from Darwin to Adelaide which started earlier.Built by a 60-strong team of students at the university's engineering department, the car weighs 265lb (120kg) and is designed to run at an average speed of 50mph (80km/h).During testing prior to the race, the team wrote on their blog: "The first three hours of testing went exactly as planned."Unfortunately, we also did one unplanned test, of the structural integrity of the chassis. We had an accident."The vehicle rolled on its side, skidded along the road and slipped down an embankment.The driver walked away unhurt as the roll cage and chassis stood up to the impact.However, the team said: "[The] solar cells on the side of the door... do not take kindly to being sanded by 50m of rough tarmac."Large portions of the side panel cells are now scattered in a thin, very expensive layer over the surface of [the road]."The team added the car was "only designed to withstand one such impact - and as such needs to be repaired to be fit for purpose".Members were unable to make the repairs in time for the start of the race.A message on their website said: "The team is very disappointed but we are confident that we have made the right decision."</body>

      <description>Celebrating the Pi with fire, vegetables and pets</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24395858</url>
      <date>1381187049</date>
      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on select buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the actually matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation…. and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <title>Can we trust the spying state?</title>
      <description>Assessing the impact of Edward Snowden</description>

      <body>How worried should we be by the state's capability to spy on us?Top secret documents, leaked by former American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, have revealed the huge capacity of Britain and America's intelligence agencies - GCHQ and the NSA - to capture communications.Snowden and his supporters have argued that the public should know more about what is happening, while governments have argued that exposure has endangered national security.Four months after the first revelations in the Guardian newspaper, a picture has emerged of Britain and America's intelligence-gathering capabilities.Taken together, the reports point to an ambition to be able to reach into the vast global tide of digital communications and be able to pick out any message and read it, as well as to conduct wide-ranging searches of billions of records to look for patterns and connections."Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded," argued Edward Snowden. "You should decide if they should be doing this."Those who have worked inside the secret state say that the power is vital for national security and only used for national security."You have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount you're looking for - but that doesn't mean the state is reading everyone's emails," former GCHQ director Sir David Omand told the BBC."What the state needs and law enforcement needs is the possibility of accessing the communications of the terrorists, the criminals, the kidnappers, the proliferators, the paedophiles. But those communications are all mixed up with everyone else's communications - there are 204 million emails a minute buzzing around the globe."So you have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount that you are looking for. But it doesn't mean that the state is reading everyone's emails, nor would that conceivably be feasible."But can we trust the state with this power?Technology allows it to do things it could never have done before - collecting and sifting through billions of records using data mining to find a connection or reconstructing a person's social interactions from the trail they leave behind online.The lack of sufficient oversight worries those who have campaigned on civil liberties."Part of the problem here is an age problem," says David Davis, a former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary."My generation of politicians - up to ones 20 years younger than me - don't really understand the extent to which we are intruding into people's privacy."Mr Davis believes the current system of oversight and accountability is not strong enough, especially when access to metadata about communications and interactions only requires internal authorisation within an intelligence agency - and not the warrant that is required to intercept the actual content of communications."There is no need to trust the state unless it has got a good reason and they must justify that to someone else - a judge or a magistrate or someone who is outside their system and can check they are using it properly," he argues.The claim that encryption standards have been deliberately weakened or had so-called "backdoors" added to allow access by intelligence agencies caused particular anger among those who have spent their careers trying to improve internet security and ensure the privacy of communications."The NSA's actions have done more than undermine online security - they've threatened to break the internet," Ross Anderson, Professor in Security Engineering at Cambridge University says of its attempts to ensure access."In order to do this they have compromised in various ways the protocols on which the internet relies. When you introduce these vulnerabilities, they are not just for the spies to use. They are available for bad guys to use as well."The Snowden documents have surprised many, including Prof Anderson, in terms of the scale of what they reveal."To find that they had built this machine and got it working is an eye-opener," he told the BBC.Critics of the intelligence agencies believe the disclosures have been important in starting a public debate about whether we know enough about the state's capability and whether there are enough controls and oversight.But many of those inside the intelligence world point to the damage which they say the revelations have done. They fear that since Edward Snowden is in Russia, the Russian state will have found some way of accessing the information."Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents," Sir David Omand told the BBC.The concern is also that the more that is revealed in public, the more the targets of surveillance adapt their behaviour. Sir David believes Snowden's actions will do real damage to national security."My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow-motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorists and cybercriminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities we have, and they will adopt their methods and be harder to track down," says the former GCHQ director.In the last week, the BBC was given direct access to a small selection of original documents held outside the UK that form the basis of stories the Guardian newspaper has already published.The scale of the capability they reveal - and the secrets they contain - make clear there are serious issues involved in balancing the public interest and national security. That balance lies at the heart of this debate - between the public interest and the right to know about what the state can do and the need for the state to protect its secrets and its capabilities for the sake of national security.The question remains - who gets to decide?</body>

      <title>How does Twitter make money?</title>
      <description>How does Twitter make its money?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24397472</url>
      <date>1380892903</date>
      <body>On Thursday, Twitter announced that it wanted to raise $1bn (£619m) by listing on the US stock markets, making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) from a technology company since Facebook went public in May 2012.The giant micro-blogging site, founded just seven years ago, has been valued at about $10bn.So, how does Twitter make its money and how can we explain its high valuation?Twitter may have more than 218 million monthly users, but the company does not make money - yet.In papers filed with US regulators, it was revealed for the first time that Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.But analysts say the company is showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.One research firm, eMarketer, estimates that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year.Almost all of Twitter's revenue - about 85% of it - comes from advertising on its site.There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend.Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates.A budget is usually set at the start of the campaign and then the advertiser pays per click or per retweet.It also has a "bidding" system in which advertisers compete with each other to have their content appear in a particular space."One of the advantages of Twitter for marketers over traditional display advertising is they have worked really hard to make sure that advertising on Twitter is not interruptive," says Lara O'Reilly, senior reporter at Marketing Week.Anything that disrupts the user experience might reduce engagement from users, which in turn can put off advertisers, Ms O'Reilly says."It's not a flashy banner that gets in the way of something. It looks very native," she explains.Also, the company takes in a significant portion of its advertising revenue from mobile devices - in contrast with Facebook, which had not fully developed its mobile strategy at the time of its listing.As of 2013, more than 65% of Twitter's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period."Because Twitter was born as a mobile platform they already have this part sorted," Ms O'Reilly adds. "In investors' eyes, they have a mobile strategy."Data licensing is Twitter's second major revenue stream.The micro-blogger sells something known as the "firehose", its public data, which often adds up to about 500 million tweets each day.Companies can dive deep into the data to analyse consumer trends and sell their insight on to other brands and companies.Because the tweets are public, consumers also have access to this data.But Nick Halstead, founder of DataSift, one of the only two companies with access to the firehose, says that with sophisticated analysis companies can learn detailed and specific information about their users that, because of the volume of data, an ordinary user or company would not be able to get.Firms could use the data to do simple things, he says, like monitoring sentiment towards their brand or product.But the data can also be used in a much more complex way."One of my favourites is around stock levels," Mr Halstead says."For example, in the US football teams will analyse the popularity of players by region to work out how much they should buy of a particular football top to stock them in shops."He adds: "In the UK we all rush out and buy barbecue equipment on particular weekends, and supermarkets want to stock up when that happens, but they need three or four days to do that."You can use Twitter for modelling when people are planning to hold those kind of events."While Twitter may have proved it has the potential to make money, analysts say there are still hurdles to profitability.The company is spending a lot of money investing in advertising technology and expanding its team, says Clark Fredericksen, vice president at eMarketer.And it plans to keep spending after going public."We can expect that they will continue to make those investments because they're looking long-term," he says.But Mr Fredericksen adds Twitter needs to show it can monetise its international users and work with small businesses."When Twitter goes to advertisers a big part of their pitch is using Twitter to work with other media," he says, adding that the site gets huge traction with users around events like the Oscars or episodes of popular television shows such as Breaking Bad."Whether that formula will translate in smaller TV markets needs to be seen."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <description>Avoid big costs for using the net on your phone when abroad</description>

      <body>You would have a shock if you received a £5,858 phone bill following a trip abroad.That's what Claude Douglas from Aldershot got because he forgot to turn off the data roaming function on his handset.Smartphones and tablets automatically seek out mobile connections in order to install updates so it's easy to run up a high bill.Here are some ways to avoid a nasty surprise when you get home.Check the data roaming prices for the country you are visiting with your network provider before you leave.Ask them about data bundles and packages which could make your bill cheaper.When you connect your mobile to a network abroad you are charged for the data you send and receive.The price for data is usually based on the volume you use, which is measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB).Print out anything you need, such as local maps or places to eat and drink before you leave.If you only plan to make calls or send texts, switch your data roaming off before you leave home.You can do this in your device settings.If you're planning to access the internet reset your device's data usage counter then keep an eye on it.Try to stay within your allowance.Mobile operators must send customers a text message or email when they reach 80% and 100% of the agreed limit, according to Uswitch.There is a price cap on data roaming charges in the European Union (EU).In the EU, phone companies can charge no more than €0.45 (around 38p) per MB of data. This will then fall to €0.20 in July 2014.Data roaming costs can be significantly higher outside Europe.Try to avoid data heavy activities such accessing maps or downloading updates.Take advantage of free wi-fi in airports, cafes or hotels. Turn off data roaming on your device, just in case.If you have a free wi-fi connection its an especially good time for contacting friends and family through apps such as Google+ Hangouts, Facetime, Skype or Viber.Consider buying a local pay-as-you-go SIM card in the country you visit, for local prices. Beware though, it won't work if your phone is locked to a particular network.If you are a frequent traveller you can buy a global SIM. You can usually purchase these in your local mobile phone shop or supermarket.First of all, contact your network provider to look into the unexpected charges.You can make a formal complaint to them if you can't reach an agreement. Check the guidelines outlined on the back of your bill or on the company website.You can take your complaint to the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) or Ombudsman Services: Communications if you still don't resolve it.These are free services which provide an independent decision in a dispute for customers of communications companies.Watchdog is broadcast on BBC One, Wednesdays at 20:00.</body>

      <title>Why loving One Direction is hard work</title>
      <description>Why loving One Direction can be hard work</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24351904</url>
      <date>1380698885</date>
      <body>Every night, 16-year-old SJ arrives home from her school in London and gets back to running her global media empire.She is one of the UK's most famous Directioners - as fans of heart-throb boy band One Direction are known.And while she would never go so far as to call herself 1D's biggest fan - that's just asking for trouble - her Harry Styles-inspired account, @STYLATORARMY, is certainly up there: 850,000 followers and counting."I think it's just because I tweet the content other fans want to see and can relate to," she explains, deftly simplifying a social media strategy for which marketing agencies routinely charge thousands."Also because I talk to a lot of other fans on there and don't ignore people - that makes them like my account, spread the word and follow me."Her account is a mixture of news about the boys, dialogue with other fans, and general adoration for the X-Factor runners-up who have seemingly taken over the world.She is the epitome of the modern day super-fan - because in 2013, loving popstars means a lot more than simply running down the road after the Beatles.No, in an age where so-called "big data" is changing business, it's also changing what it means to idolise as well.And not only can music fans say they merely love an artist, but they can demonstrate that love with black and white statistics - and use it to their advantage.Buddybounce, a London-based start-up, is seeking to provide something of an idolisation dashboard for both fans and artists alike, taking into account the millions of plays, tweets and other interactions that take place every day."It is a modern-day fan club that allows fans to get their dream, really, of being the biggest fan and get closer to their idols," explains Emma Obanye, one of the company's co-founders, who has fond memories from her teens of standing outside BBC Television Centre, waiting for the Backstreet Boys.When a fan signs up to Buddybounce, they are given the option to plug in various different services to monitor how often they interact with an artist.The site can monitor how often you tweet about the band, or watch a YouTube clip, or listen to an album on Spotify, and a whole host of other things.To get noticed, it means hours and hours of effort to clock up the points.For the labels that use it, Buddybounce is a tool that is attempting to make sense of the thousands of digital acts of fandom that come an artist's way every day."We have developed a way for artists to keep track of who has been rewarded as a fan," explains Giulia Piu, Ms Obanye's business partner, where "rewards" mean some kind of reciprocal interaction from a band member."So instead of basing it on luck, we give them a way to try and interact with as many fans as possible."It is this idea of "luck" which causes perhaps the most friction within fan communities.Fans often go to extreme lengths to catch an artist's eye, says Directioner SJ."People come up with all sorts of ideas to get their attention. Sometimes people throw their phones on stage - once a girl hid in a bin!"It didn't work. The boys went inside... and then security took her out of the bin."Naturally, faced with the noise, it's hard for artists to spot the real devotees - and getting it wrong can cause great upset."Justin Bieber once mentioned someone on Twitter who had just listened to his album once, but wasn't much of a fan, and said, 'This album's all right,'" explains Ms Obanye."Justin retweeted her - and there was so much hate from within his fan base because they were like, 'Oh my god, you should be noticing us' and this, that and the other."For fans now, that kind of interaction is so sought after - a mention, a follow... it's a reward, it's what they dream, what they really want."The company has teamed up with artists, including Conor Maynard, who has granted highly sought-after meet-and-greets to fans with the best Buddybounce scores.So for fans like SJ, having such a huge following may see them rewarded by getting closer to the band.But being a "famous" fan has some dangerous downsides."Recently, I've had emails from a team of people," SJ says, "pretending they were from 1D's management.""They made it look like it was coming from them - it had [official domain] onedirectionmusic.com in the email address."Then they pretended to be [the band's record label] Syco as well, basically emailing me saying, 'We have an amazing opportunity for you.'"What followed was a stream of emails, spoofed tweets and messages with the sole intention of gaining control of SJ's account.It wasn't an isolated incident - fake accounts are set up frequently, capitalising on fans' dreams of meeting their idols, even if such offers do raise alarm bells as seemingly too good to be true.Social networks have put in place efforts to make spotting scams easier, the most obvious of which is Twitter's "blue tick" system - an added logo showing an account has been checked and is legitimate.It's a problem that artists and their labels need to remain on top of if they are to make sure that social media remains a key part of the marketing machine, up there with making music videos or even going on tour."It was the UK fans' excitement about One Direction that really got them started," argues Sunil Singhvi, Twitter's head of entertainment for the UK."The fans' ability, via Twitter, to tell Europeans about One Direction really catapulted them there, then from Europe to America, and now it's a global phenomenon."Sonny Takhar, chief executive for Syco Records, is equally enthused: "Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before."And unsurprisingly, Directioner SJ agrees: "The boys have said themselves how social media has been part of their success, because if we make a 'trend' about them, you can see that worldwide - so it spreads the message to other nations."So while the super-fan of 2013 may have their work cut out to stay digitally popular, their efforts might not be in vain, even if they never do get to meet the subject of their adoration."There are a few others like SJ who are benefiting right now, from a young age," says SJ's mum, Rebecca."That is a credit to all those fans out there who have done so well in learning how to use Twitter as a tool to communicate with their idol, but at the same time within their own community as well."Quite a lot of young people are going to be getting very good jobs in that field very soon."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <title>Lennox calls for pop video ratings</title>
      <description>Pop star Annie Lennox describes modern pop videos as "pornographic", and says they should be subject to a ratings system.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24432329</url>
      <date>1381165254</date>
      <body>Pop star Annie Lennox has described the sexualised imagery of modern pop videos as "dark" and "pornographic"."I'm all for freedom of expression," she told BBC Radio 5 live, "but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn.""How do you stop your kids being exposed to it? It's so powerful. You don't want to see your seven-year-old girls twerking all over the place."The singer has called for pop videos to be rated in the same way as films.She previously wrote on her Facebook page that if a pop star created "a soft porn video or highly sexualised live performance, then it needs to qualify as such and be X-rated for adults only".She told 5 live pressure from parents could help to establish "very clear boundaries" on acceptable standards in videos.Her comments fuelled a debate started by Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with singer Robin Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger.That performance, and a similarly risque video for her single Wrecking Ball, prompted Sinead O'Connor to write an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business.Artists such as Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna have also been criticised for explicit performances and costumes in the past.Lennox did not single out any one performer for criticism - referring instead to a "recent spate of overtly sexualised performances and videos" in her Facebook statement."I have nothing against these artists," she told 5 live's Anna Foster. "I was never bashing them."There's nothing wrong with sexuality and sensuality and I think these artists are beautiful. And, in many ways, what they do is fantastic, but it needs to be age-appropriate."These guys have young fan bases and they are being barraged with it."I don't think there's one parent of young boys and girls in this country that would honestly, comfortably say they were fine with seeing their kids being exposed to that kind of thing.""I think this debate is about getting the voice of reason back there to say 'look, we want to protect our kids.'"</body>

      <title>Paxman criticises PM's WWI comments</title>

      <date>1381214790</date>
      <body>Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has criticised the prime minister for comments he made about how Britain will mark the centenary of World War I.David Cameron said he wanted to see a "commemoration that, like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, says something about who we are as a people".Paxman told the Radio Times that centenary events should "have almost nothing in common" with the Jubilee.He spoke of concerns the centenary could become a "celebration of war".Mr Cameron's comments were made in a speech at the Imperial War Museum in London in October last year.He promised a "truly national commemoration" to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war - in 2014, Armistice Day in 2018, and the dates of major battles in between.Paxman, whose great uncle died in the war, said that "not to acknowledge the war's significance would be wilful myopia", but that "the whole catastrophe has been overlain with myth and legend".But the 63-year-old, who also presents University Challenge, said the Jubilee was "an excuse for a knees-up in the rain to celebrate the happy fact that our national identity is expressed through a family rather than some politician who wants the job to gratify his vanity"."A number of distinguished fellow citizens, like the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy and the thoughtful musician Brian Eno, are worried that the events will turn into a celebration of war. Only a moron would 'celebrate' the war," he added.He added: "We shouldn't 'celebrate' the outbreak of the First World War. But not to recognise that it was one of the most consequential events in our history would just be perverse."The prime minister used the speech to announce that more than £50m has been allocated for a "historic" commemoration of World War I.</body>

      <title>Viewers complain over Downton plot</title>
      <description>ITV say that 60 people have complained over Sunday's "shocking" episode of Downton Abbey.</description>

      <date>1381216756</date>
      <body>ITV has received 60 complaints over the latest episode of costume drama Downton Abbey, broadcast on Sunday.Viewers took to Twitter to express their "shock" and "distress" after Anna May Bates (Joanne Froggatt) was attacked and raped by a guest's valet.A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes was broadcast before the episode aired.Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has also received a number of complaints - although it cannot yet release figures.An average of 9.2 million viewers watched the episode, with a peak audience of 9.9 million.They saw Anna attacked while the rest of the servants, guests and family were watching an opera performance upstairs.Katy Rink writing in the The Daily Telegraph was one of those shocked at the episode. "Last night we writhed in our sofas, disbelieving and uncomfortable," she said, pointing out that the incident risked alienating viewers who watch Downton for gentle escapism.Viewer Lucy Raine tweeted: "I am genuinely so distressed at what just happened on Downton Abbey I feel sick."While Jennifer Durie tweeted: "I don't think I will ever forgive the writers of Downton Abbey for what they did to Anna."But Nigel Harman, who played attacker Mr Green, said in an interview with ITV's This Morning that the intention was to shock."It was a shocking and bold storyline," he said, adding that when he read the script he was "amazed and excited by it, if that makes sense, because for a show like Downton it really leaped out as a bold and risky idea".He added: "I'd worked with Joanne Froggatt and Brendan Coyle before and we had a rehearsal and went for it. And what we wanted to do was to try and not signal about what was to come."We went for something - as it would be in real life - very shocking."The show has not been afraid to shock viewers in the past, with the unexpected death of key character Matthew Crawley bringing last year's Christmas episode to a sombre conclusion.</body>

      <title>Press plan for regulation 'rejected'</title>
      <description>Senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have rejected the press's own favoured version of a royal charter for press regulation, the BBC's Newsnight has learned.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24439588</url>
      <date>1381217527</date>
      <body>Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.A source said a sub-committee of the Privy Council, containing Lib Dem and Tory cabinet ministers, thought the proposals were "flawed".But sub-committee chair Danny Alexander insisted no decision had been made.The full Privy Council is also looking at an alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners.It is due to announce its decision on the press proposals on Wednesday and the alternative plan on 30 October.Press regulation options are being considered in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, which was set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Politicians and the press have been at odds over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the regulator.The government's proposals published in March have cross-party backing and the support of campaign group Hacked Off.There are a series of key differences between the industry's plan for press regulation and that agreed by politicians and campaigners.Newsnight's political editor Allegra Stratton was told Privy Council members felt proposals for self-regulation put forward by newspapers did not meet the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report.Mr Alexander, who told the BBC the sub-committee met on Monday and the full Privy Council will meet on Wednesday to consider the press proposal, said there were a "few remaining" details to be decided - but insisted "no final decision has been made".But ministers "do look set to reject" the form of regulation put forward by newspapers, BBC political editor Nick Robinson said.The Privy Council sub-committee sub-committee consists of four Tories and two Lib Dems - and both parties have been critical of the press proposals - he added.Steve Hewlett, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, told Newsnight that newspaper publishers felt the process had been far from transparent.He said: "People I have spoken to are furious and are now considering whether there might be a legal challenge to this decision by the Privy Council."The newspapers' proposals would:Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of the Sun, said the news was not a shock."It's what we'd been given fairly clear clues would happen," he said."I think it has to be seen as a great victory for the forces of oppression of a free press - Hacked Off in particular - and the politicians who have gone along for the ride."Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said the press's plan had been a "delaying manoeuvre" by the big national newspapers."The problem with the papers is that they do not want to deal fairly with complaints," he said.Mr Cathcart said there was a "rare unanimity" in Parliament on this issue, and the press was refusing to compromise "like an errant child on the naughty step with his fingers in his ears".He said only the press stood against the consensus in politics and the public which said: "We want Parliament's royal charter - Leveson's royal charter - and we want it now."Earlier, Gerry McCann said the newspaper industry's plans for press regulation were "a gentlemen's club agreement" and should be rejected by politicians.The father of missing Madeleine McCann said the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry were the "minimum acceptable".Mr McCann and his family were subject to intense press attention after Madeleine went missing while they were on holiday in Portugal in 2007.</body>

      <title>Allen pulls Blue Jasmine in India</title>
      <description>Woody Allen stops his latest film, Blue Jasmine, from being screened in India after learning mandatory anti-tobacco adverts would be inserted during the movie's smoking scenes.</description>

      <body>Woody Allen has stopped his latest film, Blue Jasmine, from being screened in India after learning mandatory anti-tobacco adverts would be inserted into its smoking scenes.Indian law requires health warnings to be shown on screen when characters smoke in films, while cinemas must play anti-smoking ads before every movie.According to Reuters, Allen refused to accommodate the ads during his film.It had been due to open in around 30 cinemas at the weekend.Blue Jasmine stars Cate Blanchett as a wealthy New York socialite who suffers a humiliating fall from grace after her husband is arrested for financial fraud.The actress's critically acclaimed performance has seen her odds of winning an Oscar next year slashed to 1/4 from an initial 7/1 in August.The film features two smoking scenes that would have given cause for the on-screen disclaimers - typically scrolling text warning viewers of the dangers of tobacco use.A publicist for Allen told Reuters: "Due to content in the film, it cannot be shown in India in its intended manner. Therefore, the film is not scheduled to play there."The film's Indian distributor, PVR films, told DNA newspaper the director had overall creative control over the film."He wasn't comfortable with the disclaimer that we are required to run when some smoking scene is shown in films," Deepak Sharma said."He feels that when the scroll comes, attention goes to it rather than the scene. We had to abide by the law and we don't have control over the film."India's film censor board regularly requires changes to films and while some directors allow the alterations, others have refused.Many, including Martin Scorsese and David Lynch, argue changes to their films - including changing the aspect ratio in which some movies are shot - are unacceptable because they corrupt the artist's vision.</body>

      <body>Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard has collected this year's Pen Pinter Prize at the British Library in London.The 76-year-old gave an address at the event, which also featured readings from his plays.Sir Tom also announced he had chosen Belarusian journalist Iryna Khalip as the recipient of this year's writer of courage award.The prize recognises an international writer who has been persecuted for speaking out about their beliefs.Sir Tom said Khalip was chosen in recognition of her vocal criticism of her native government in spite of intimidation and imprisonment.The journalist, who is a correspondent for the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, has long written and protested against alleged human rights abuses.In 2010, Khalip and her husband were arrested after taking part in protests against Belarus's presidential election, which were surrounded by accusations of fraud.She was given a two-year suspended sentence for "organising and preparing activities severely disruptive of public order" in 2011. The sentence was dropped in July this year.Sir Tom said he was "proud to share the prize with a brave reporter".Khalip added: "It's a real honour for me but, more than this, it's a recognition of the just fight of the people of Belarus for human rights and for our dignity."The Pen Pinter Prize was established in 2009 in memory of playwright Harold Pinter and is awarded to a writer who casts an "unflinching, unswerving" gaze upon the world and shows a "fierce intellectual determination...to define the real truth of our lives and our societies".Sir Tom is known for co-writing the Oscar-winning screenplay for Shakespeare in Love, as well as his stage works The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.Lady Antonia Fraser, Pinter's widow, said: ''Harold would have greeted Tom's win with enthusiasm as a great admirer of his work; he would have been particularly pleased by the award to Iryna, since the Belarusian cause was close to his heart."</body>

      <body>Doctor Who actor Matt Smith is to star in a musical version of the controversial novel American Psycho.The 30-year-old has been cast as the psychopathic serial killer Patrick Bateman in the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 thriller.The production will run at London's Almeida Theatre from 3 December to 25 January 2014.The show almost completely sold out within hours of Smith's involvement being revealed.Set in the 1980s, American Psycho tells the story a 26-year-old Manhattan investment banker whose sanity slowly disintegrates, turning him into a brutal murderer.It was previously adapted for the big screen in 2000 with Christian Bale in the lead role.The show, which was announced minus cast details in January, will be directed by the Almeida's new artistic director, Rupert Goold, who developed the musical with his former company, Headlong.Tony Award-winning composer Duncan Sheik has collaborated with Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark scriptwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa to adapt the book for the stage.Smith said he was "excited" to be part of the production."The opportunity to work with Rupert Goold, a director of great vision and flair, combined with the brilliant story and music, seemed like such a cool challenge," he said.Goold added: "Matt Smith is a wonderful stage performer and the perfect actor not only to lead our exceptional cast but also my first show as artistic director here at the Almeida."Smith has just finished filming his final scenes for the Christmas special of Doctor Who, which will see his character regenerate into the 12th Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi.</body>

      <title>BBC 'to launch personalised iPlayer'</title>
      <description>The BBC's director general Tony Hall is expected to announce the next generation iPlayer in a keynote speech on Tuesday.</description>

      <date>1381143897</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general Tony Hall is expected to announce the launch of the next generation BBC iPlayer in a keynote speech on Tuesday.It is understood he will explain his vision for an enhanced iPlayer, allowing users to personalise their viewing and listening choices.The iPlayer, launched in 2007, provides a catch-up service for BBC TV and radio programmes.The speech is Lord Hall's first since his joining speech in April.Entitled Where Next?, Lord Hall's speech will discuss the technological challenges facing the BBC, as more people turn to the internet via mobile phones and tablets to watch TV.As part of this focus, BBC Radio 1 has announced it is going to get its own channel on the iPlayer.The station said this will allow fans to watch exclusive performances and interviews not broadcast anywhere else.It is hoped that the channel will help Radio 1 reach more young people.Content will include music featured in Radio 1's Live Lounge and at the annual Big Weekend festival as well as interviews with celebrities and artists from around the world.But as the iPlayer becomes more bespoke for each user, media commentators have already begun to question the validity of the fixed licence fee paid by the public.Writing in the Guardian on Sunday, Steve Hewlett wrote: "One question that must surely arise in the unbundled 'My BBC' world is, once I've picked out the bits of the BBC I use and value, why should I pay for the rest?"And because the technology of on-demand delivery that underpins the whole project allows subscription in a way that broadcast TV and radio don't - at least not easily - 'My BBC' will inevitably in time reignite the question of subscription funding, for some BBC services at least."Lord Hall will also announce the launch of an app for mobile phones and tablets to allow listeners to hear their favourite radio programmes in one place.The app will showcase new pieces of content each day. Users will be able to choose what they want to hear and when they want to hear it.In time, users will be able to personalise their choices, with the app suggesting programmes they may like depending on their interests and the time they have available.It will feature programmes from stations including BBC Radio 4, Radio 3 and the World Service.Director of BBC Radio Helen Boaden said: "Listeners will get outstanding programmes from brilliant brains in a way which fits into their packed lives."A launch is planned in 2014, with content available both in the UK and internationally.In Tuesday's speech, Lord Hall will also flesh out the details of a 20% increase in funding for the BBC's arts coverage.The director general - who used to run the Royal Opera House - is keen to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand, while two new television series will be fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr respectively.Lord Hall also wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.The director general is expected to unveil new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.The announcements are part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and come as the corporation is in the process of cutting 2,000 jobs by 2017 after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <body>Sesame Street characters Cookie Monster and Elmo are to star in a new programme for CBeebies.The Furchester will see the pair working in an "almost world-class hotel" owned by a family of "cheerfully incompetent monsters".The show, which aims to improve children's problem-solving skills, will be co-produced by CBeebies and Sesame Street makers, Sesame Workshop.The 52-part series will be screened next autumn.The Furchester hotel will be headed up by owners Funella Furchester, her "beleaguered husband" Furgus Fuzz and their daughter, Phoebe Furchester-Fuzz.Elmo is Phoebe's cousin who is on an extended visit to the hotel and fascinated by all it has to offer.Cookie Monster will be working in his dream job as a room-service and dining-room waiter.The series will begin production in MediaCityUK in Salford in the new year."The development of The Furchester has been a wonderful meeting of creative minds from both CBeebies In House Production and Sesame Workshop," CBeebies controller Kay Benbow said.H Melvin Ming, president and chief executive officer of Sesame Workshop, added: "This partnership brings together two dynamic, enduring brands in children's media and we are confident that The Furchester will prove to be a great favourite with children and their parents and caregivers."Cookie Monster first appeared on Sesame Street when it started in the US in 1969, with Elmo joining in the 70s and becoming a regular character on the programme in the 80s.The show is now watched in more than 150 countries and has been adapted around the world, including in China, Brazil and Nigeria.</body>

      <title>Black Beauty author letters found</title>
      <description>A historian discovers a rare collection of letters by Black Beauty author Anna Sewell and brings them back to her home county of Norfolk.</description>

      <body>A rare collection of letters, signed by Black Beauty author Anna Sewell between 1820 and 1860, has been brought back to her home county of Norfolk.Local historian Glynn Burrows snapped up the letters, described by Norfolk archivist Frank Meeres as "valuable" in terms of social history.Mr Burrows said there are seven letters written by the author and a working manuscript of a poem.Anna Sewell finished her only novel in 1877 and died five months later.Mr Meeres, from the Norfolk Record Office, said to find letters from Anna Sewell was "quite uncommon".He said: "I'm sure they are valuable in terms of cash and they are valuable in terms of what they would tell us about life in Victorian England."They'd certainly be something we'd like to show to the public."Mr Burrows, who found the letters on an internet auction site, said there was one letter signed "your loving sister Anna Sewell" and several signed "Nannie", her family's pet name for her.Other documents in the collection include letters relating to her brother Philip, and from her mother, Mary, father Isaac and aunt Emma to Anna Sewell."The interesting ones are the family ones," said Mr Burrows.'For instance, when her brother lost one of his children, Anna wrote a poem all about his little girl who died, and there's actually a working copy of this poem... where she's crossed words out and changed the wording."Anna Sewell's biographer, Dr Adrienne Gavin said the find was exciting."It's a rare find," she said."There are not many letters in her own hand that exist and they'll shed more light on the woman who wrote Black Beauty and who was active in charity work among the poor."She wrote Black Beauty on her death bed in her mid 50s, and died five months after it was published."For Mr Burrows, who hopes the letters will eventually be housed in the Norfolk Record Office, the collection brought back memories of his childhood."When I was little my dad always used to read me and my sister a couple of pages from this great big copy of Black Beauty before we went to bed," he said."So [the find] took me back to those days in the '60s."</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <body>Morrissey's autobiography is to be published later this month after the former Smiths singer resolved a dispute with his publisher that had threatened to derail the book's release.Last month, the singer claimed "a last-minute content disagreement" with Penguin had led the deal to "collapse".Despite initially saying he was seeking a new publisher, Morrissey has now patched up relations with Penguin.Penguin Classics said Autobiography by Morrissey would come out on 17 October.That is a month later than the original publication date of 16 September.A Penguin spokesperson declined to comment on the cause of the dispute and the delay.The memoir is expected to lift the lid on the 54-year-old's life growing up in Manchester and his relationship with his former bandmates in The Smiths, one of the most important bands in British music.He has enjoyed a successful solo career since the band split up in 1987 and is also known for outspoken views on animal cruelty, politics and the royal family.This year, the singer suffered a series of what he referred to as "medical mishaps" which led to him cancelling his US tour.He was also forced to cancel part of his South American tour in July due, he said, to a "lack of funding".</body>

      <body>Space film Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, has shot straight to the top of the US box office in its opening weekend.According to early estimates, the movie took $55.55m (£34.62m) over the weekend, making it the biggest October opening since records began.The figure also ensured it was the biggest opening for a film starring Bullock or Clooney.The film, set almost entirely in space, is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.Bullock and Clooney play an astronaut and a medical engineer who work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.Last week's number one, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, dropped into second slot with $21.5m (£13.4m).Based on a children's book, the first film - Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs - was a breakout hit for Sony Animation in 2009.The follow-up is an original story, in which inventor Flint Lockwood must save the day after one of his inventions malfunctions, creating food-animal creatures, or animals made of food, that overtake the region of Swallow Falls.Runner Runner, starring Oscar-winner Ben Affleck and pop star and actor Justin Timberlake, opened in third place, taking just $7.6m (£4.7m).The crime thriller follows Timberlake as a graduate student who goes to Costa Rica to confront an online gambling tycoon played by Affleck, who swindles him.Former number one Prisoners, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, slipped from second place to fourth.Formula One movie Rush, which depicts the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, took fifth spot.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, Don Jon, about a porn addict looking for love, was next in sixth place."The adult drama is back, and fall is the season for the adult drama," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak."This is when you get your more challenging films, some of the more esoteric fare."</body>

      <title>Italian director Carlo Lizzani dies</title>
      <description>Police investigate a suspected suicide after 91-year-old film director Carlo Lizzani falls from a balcony at his house in Rome, local reports say.</description>

      <body>Tributes are being paid to Italian director Carlo Lizzani, 91, who died on Saturday after falling from a third-floor balcony at his house in Rome.Local news agencies said authorities were investigating if it was suicide.Lizzani, who was head of the Venice Film Festival for four years, directed 1968 film The Violent Four and worked on Rossellini's Germany Year Zero.Fellow Italian director Ettore Scola told the ANSA news agency: "This is a time of great sadness."President Giorgio Napolitano, who had known Lizzani for decades, honoured the filmmaker for his contributions to "cinema, to culture and to the democratic development of our country".Lizzani started out as a film critic and then screenwriter for famous neo-realist, Rossellini.As well as a writing credit on his 1948 film, Germany Year Zero, Lizzani also earned an Oscar nomination for his work on Giuseppe De Santis' 1950 film Bitter Rice.He was awarded best director by the Academy of Italian Cinema in 1968 for his own film The Violent Four about a manhunt for bank robbers.He won its best screenwriter award for 1996 film Celluloide about the making of Rossellini's masterpiece, Rome, Open City.Throughout his career Lizzani collaborated with film directors including, Jean-Luc Godard, Marco Bellocchio, Bernardo Bertolucci and Pier Paolo Pasolini.He directed the Venice Film Festival from 1979-1982, and was a member of the jury of the Berlin Film Festival in 1994.Paolo Baratta, president of the Biennale - which includes the film festival - praised Lizzani's work."The Biennale is crying on the day of Carlo Lizzani's death," said Baratta."He knew how to give the festival new energy. He knew how to create a nucleus of young students and experts that would represent in future years the true elite. The world of Italian cinema owes him a lot."Lizzani began his career just after World War II in 1948 with a documentary about Italian Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti.His death comes nearly three years after another well-known director, Mario Monicelli, died after jumping from a hospital window in Rome.</body>

      <title>Haim beat Justin to top album chart</title>

      <body>US band Haim have denied Justin Timberlake his fourth UK number one album, after topping the chart with their debut, Days Are Gone.Timberlake's album, The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, had led midweek sales by just 28 copies but was overtaken by Californian sisters, Haim.In the singles chart, OneRepublic's Counting Stars claimed victory from The Vamps' Can We Dance.The Official Charts Company said it was "the closest race of the year".Ryan Tedder's band OneRepublic secured its first UK number one after rising two places, with just 1,150 copies standing between the two tracks.The debut record from Haim, made up of sisters Este, Danielle and Alana, had been eagerly anticipated since the band won the BBC's Sound Of 2013 poll in January.Days Are Gone features their three hit singles Don't Save Me, Falling and The Wire, which the band dedicated to Prime Minister David Cameron when they both appeared on the Andrew Marr programme on BBC One last week.It finished the week 2,100 copies ahead of the second instalment of Timberlake's 20/20 Experience album series.The original album, which is still at number 33 in the chart, spent three weeks at Number 1 in March and was the star's third consecutive UK number one album.Last week's number one album - Mechanical Bull by Kings Of Leon - slipped down to three, with Arctic Monkeys' AM static at four and Drake's Nothing Was The Same down to five.Dizzee Rascal's The Fifth enterted the album chart at number ten, while his new single Something Really Bad took the same position in the single's chart.Jason Derulo's single Talk Dirty FT 2 Chainz dropped to number three with Katy Perry's Roar in fourth and Chase and Status in fifth with Count On Me FT Moko.This week's chart also saw Avicii's Wake Me Up become one of the UK's biggest-selling singles of all time, after it broke through the million copies sales barrier on Sunday.The Official Charts Company said the track is only the 140th single to achieve this milestone, and the third of 2013 behind Daft Punk's Get Lucky FT Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines FT TI and Pharrell Williams.Wake Me Up, by 24-year-old Swedish DJ and Producer Avicii, spent three consecutive weeks at number one after debuting in that position in July, and denied One Direction their fourth UK chart topper with Best Song Ever.</body>

      <body>An Oxford University music student has won the Bryn Terfel Scholarship at the Urdd Gobaith Cymru youth competition in Aberystwyth.Flautist Chloe-Angharad Bradshaw from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, took the £4,000 prize following a concert at the Great Hall in Aberystwyth Arts Centre.Judges called her a "master at creating the fine sound of the flute".Ms Bradshaw plans to use the money to pay for travel expenses to overseas auditions for further study.As well as her studies at Oxford, she is also president of the university's music society and a member of the orchestra and sinfonietta.She said of the win: "I really enjoyed performing tonight, even though I was very nervous before performing my first piece."The other competitors were very professional, friendly and it was great to get a chance to share a stage with them."When they announced my name as the winner, I could not believe my ears and I just couldn't stop smiling."With the scholarship money, I am going to use it towards a masters degree. I've seen a few courses that appeal in Europe and the USA and this money will enable me to pay for flights to auditions abroad."Judge Eirian Owen praised all six competitors, adding: "They were all experienced in their field and mature performers but the winner did stand out."Even though it was close, we were unanimous that Chloe was the winner."Chloe's technique on the flute is excellent. She is obviously a master at creating the fine sound of the flute and I'm sure that she will go far."The prize was established by opera singer Bryn Terfel in 1999 to nurture young singing talent in Wales and is open to winners of eight specified competitions at the Urdd National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts.</body>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <body>US counter-terrorism drama Homeland has returned to UK screens with overnight ratings marginally down on last year.The third season opener attracted an average 2.2 million viewers on Channel 4 including +1 services, compared with the 2.3 million that watched the first episode of season two.The figure is expected to rise when catch-up ratings are added next week.Sunday's episode saw the CIA dealing with the fallout after the car bomb explosion which ended the last series.However critics were left unimpressed with the absence of Damian Lewis's character, the marine-turned-terrorist Nicholas Brody, who was last seen on the run."The only Brody family member anyone actually cares about was awol for the entire episode," The Independent's Ellen Jones said.Sunday night ratingsMetro's Keith Watson added: "If it wasn't previously clear how much this gripping and intelligent thriller relied on Lewis's Nicholas Brody and his tangled chemistry with Claire Danes as agent Carrie, then the evidence was writ large in last night's talky, downbeat opener,"Sarah Crompton from The Telegraph picked apart the plot's plausibility, saying: "While it was a joy to watch Mandy Patinkin and F Murray Abraham strut and spar as this ancient Odd Couple, it stretched credulity that they would have ended up in charge, however many of the high command had been killed."Even less likely is that they would have managed to organise the assassination of "six targets on three continents in a tight time window".ITV drama Downton Abbey - which was broadcast at the same time as Homeland - was the most-watched programme on Sunday night with an average 9.2 million viewers including +1 figures.Sunday night's earlier TV offerings also saw 8.4 million people tune in to The X Factor to see the final six acts chosen to take part in the live shows which begin next week.An average 8.2 million people saw former golfer Tony Jacklin become the first celebrity to be voted off Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One.</body>

      <title>C4's Hunt denies age discrimination</title>
      <description>Channel 4's Jay Hunt denies racing pundit John McCririck claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".</description>

      <date>1380898859</date>
      <body>Channel 4's Jay Hunt has denied racing pundit John McCririck's claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".Speaking at an employment tribunal in London, Ms Hunt said she felt there was "no correlation" between younger presenters drawing younger audiences.She accused Mr McCririck of making "false allegations".The 73-year-old - who was dropped by the channel last year - is accusing his former employers of age discrimination.Ms Hunt - chief creative officer at Channel 4 - told the tribunal she had instigated voluntary training courses on discrimination at the broadcaster after she joined from the BBC, adding that she had "learned her lesson" from the Miriam O'Reilly case.Ms O'Reilly, who was in her 50s when she was dropped from the BBC's Countryfile programme, won an age discrimination case against the corporation in 2011.Mr McCririck had cited Moira Stuart's decision to leave the BBC while Ms Hunt was the BBC's controller of daytime. Ms Hunt said she had no involvement in the Stuart decision.In a statement, Ms Hunt noted: "John McCririck's allegation that I am a 'serial age discrimination offender' is untrue."I have been responsible for a channel or part of a channel for the past eight years. In that time, hundreds of on-screen talent decisions have been run past me by those making them."Only one of those decisions has ever led to a claim of age discrimination and, contrary to what John McCririck says, I have learnt from that case."She added: "I had no reason to believe that anyone in the team which worked up the new programme had acted on the grounds of John McCririck's age, and that remains the position."'Chauvanistic extraordinaire'Jamie Aitchison, Channel 4's commissioning editor for sport - who was responsible for dropping Mr McCririck from the channel's horse-racing coverage - told a tribunal earlier this week that the pundit's "exaggerated tone" was "out of step" with the channel's coverage.His opinion was echoed by a senior television producer, giving evidence on Friday, who had previously called for Mr McCririck to be dropped from the revamped racing line-up.Carl Hicks, part of production company IMG - which is also being sued by Mr McCririck - told the central London hearing that the commentator "was not appropriate and there was not an appropriate role for him"."John was an eccentric and seen, at worst, as a loud-mouthed and chauvinistic extraordinaire which was not what I wanted to be part of the team to broaden racing."He also told the hearing that Mr McCririck was inclined to upset his fellow colleagues.In his tribunal witness statement, he said: "My view remained that John McCririck was not right for the programme and I thought he should not be included in any capacity."I was fully aware that John was one of the most recognisable faces in horseracing," adding that he held the pundit's expertise for the subject in the highest regard."However, I did not think his exaggerated presentation style was consistent with a more serious programme and was aware that he had a potential to offend and alienate viewers and potential viewers.In March 2012, Channel 4 secured the rights to broadcast all UK horse racing events for the following year, including "crown jewel" events such as Royal Ascot and the Grand National. A new-look team, fronted by Clare Balding, took over last year.The hearing continues.</body>

      <body>Sir Bruce Forsyth has dropped out of hosting Saturday's Strictly Come Dancing after falling ill with flu.The showbiz veteran, who fronts the show with Tess Daly, has hosted the series since it launched in 2004.Sir Bruce, 85, last missed a programme because of illness in 2009. He will be replaced by Claudia Winkleman.The BBC said: "Sir Bruce Forsyth has the flu and therefore isn't feeling well enough to present tomorrow's Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One."The show looks forward to his return next week."Winkleman usually hosts the Sunday evening results show with Daly, and and has stood in for Sir Bruce in the past.Saturday will see 15 celebrity couples, including Vanessa Feltz and Hairy Biker Dave Myers, take to the dance floor and face the public vote for the first time.Model Abbey Clancy and new professional dancer Aljaz Skorjanec topped the leader board last week, scoring 32 points from the judges for their waltz. TV chef Myers and golfer Tony Jacklin were bottom of the table, with just 16 points each.The points accrued last week will be carried over to this weekend, when one couple will leave the series.</body>

      <title>Why was 1973 the year UK radio changed forever?</title>
      <description>Forty years of independent local radio</description>

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <title>McAvoy: 'I toy with the audience'</title>
      <description>James McAvoy says his new film is "not for the fainthearted"</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24373354</url>
      <date>1380933124</date>
      <body>James McAvoy's latest role as a drug-fuelled corrupt Scottish police officer in Filth will not be for everyone - but the actor tells the BBC that's exactly why he signed up."It's full on and definitely not for the fainthearted, and there's not a lot of that in the film industry," he explains."The character represented an opportunity to take an audience and really toy with them."Filth sees McAvoy as detective sergeant Bruce Robertson, a man whose average day involves casual drug-taking, obscene phone calls, blackmailing young women into sex or sleeping with his friends' wives."You're making somebody laugh, and they know they shouldn't be. And then you're kind of wagging your finger going, 'Shame on you for laughing!'" he continues."Then, when they're feeling bad about themselves, you try and make the audience feel some sympathy. And they're like, 'Oh, there's depth to him! Of course, of course!'"And then you just go, 'No, there's not any depth to me! And you should feel bad about yourself for liking me again'."That just seemed really good fun. To be able to toy with whether they were enjoying it or were repulsed by it or not," he says.Based on the 1998 novel by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, some cinema-goers will find plenty to be repulsed by in McAvoy's immoral copper, whose antics become more and more outrageous as he loses touch with reality.Jamie Bell and Imogen Poots play colleagues competing for a promotion, while Jim Broadbent is his psychiatrist and Eddie Marsan a tormented friend.Originally branded "un-filmable", it was relative newcomer Jon S Baird's screenplay that finally convinced Welsh that Filth could be brought to the big screen. But neither was convinced McAvoy was suitable the role."He looked very young this particular day," remembers director Baird, sitting in the very seat at London's Soho Hotel where McAvoy first changed his and Welsh's minds."But 20 minutes after talking to him, he had morphed into this middle-aged, grizzled, alcoholic divorcee. It was pretty mad."He started talking about his experience with mental illness, and that's the thing that bonded us. He had experience of that with somebody he grew up with."As soon as I knew he understood that, it was game over. It was like, 'He is the guy'. We offered him the part the same day."For The Last King of Scotland and Atonement star, it was "a cathartic experience" to portray Bruce as he slowly unravelled.But the star, who recently took a beating in Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Trance, found himself being roughed up again for Filth - except this time he was in drag."I hated being in that outfit," grimaces McAvoy."There's something about being covered in blood and cold and you're having to act all mashed up - it makes me feel abused and not nice."Then he laughs: "And yeah, you look at yourself with a wig on and a beard and blood all over your face and just go, 'How am I ever going to get my wife to fancy me again?'"The pain was worth it - if you believe the cinema-going public in Scotland, where the film was released a week ahead of the rest of the UK and took £250,000 at just 38 screens."Trying to get this thing made over the years, I'm so relieved now that it didn't get made earlier, because it would never have been as good," confesses Welsh, who calls McAvoy's performance "off the scale"."I'm still astonished by it, to be honest. Thinking about all the great iconic solo performances that I've seen in my lifetime, I just can't think of anyone that betters it."He's got to convey loss and pathos, aggression and violence, hatred and manipulation. It's like watching a great Shakespearean."As one of the film's many producers (who also include Trudie Styler), McAvoy got to see that fearless performance of his up close in the edit suite - and even sent some scenes to the cutting-room floor."I'd be saying to Jon, 'Get rid of that bit. I know you love it, I know you think that's great but it's slowing everything down,'" he says."And you're like, 'I've just told him to cut a bit of my performance!' I never thought I'd see the day that happens, you know?"Filth also provided McAvoy with another first - acting alongside his sister, Joy."It was amazing, she's an amazing actress. She's got her own approach and her own on-screen and on-stage charisma, which I'm in thrall of at times," he says."Once the camera started rolling she was there, she was in it; and I was there and I was in it; and we just kind of went for it. That's the McAvoy way, maybe!"Next May, audiences will see McAvoy return to the land of big budget blockbusters in his second X-Men film, Days of Future Past, which he finished shooting around a month ago.He plays a younger Charles Xavier alongside the likes of Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender, and has a scene with the "original" Charles, Patrick Stewart."It was good, it was really good," says McAvoy. "We got to almost physically, but still metaphorically a little bit, pass the baton."The star has already moved on to his next film - a new take on Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which he plays Victor Von Frankenstein to Daniel Radcliffe's Igor."Me and him met last week," reveals McAvoy. "We had our first rehearsal, it was awesome.""The monster isn't so much trying to come to terms with his existence as he is in the Kenneth Branagh one," he explains."It's an adventure, and the backbone of the adventure is the relationship between me and Daniel. It's more about those two - brothers in science and brothers in adventure."He pauses, and laughs: "It sounds like I'm pitching 'Weird Science: The Movie' here!"</body>

      <title>The bumpy road to the National Theatre</title>
      <description>Did its early difficulties aid the National Theatre's vibrancy?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24382746</url>
      <date>1380846771</date>
      <body>The National Theatre may be approaching its 50th anniversary on 22 October, but did the delays and obstacles it encountered during its creation result in a more versatile and creative establishment than elsewhere in Europe?Disdain and hostility are not uncommon responses to major new cultural projects in the UK, but the venomous attacks levelled, over two centuries, against the idea of a national theatre leave a sour taste in the mouth even today.Seymour Hicks, an early 20th Century dramatist and star of musical comedies, was against it being created and said: "The National Theatre! I wonder if there are really half a dozen people insane enough to think it will ever come into existence. We have national taxes, national schools, national horrors of every kind - spare us a national theatre!"France has had a national theatre since 1680, Denmark since 1748 and Greece since 1901. The National Theatre in London is a youngster by comparison, which seems surprising, perhaps, for the country of Shakespeare. But this is a complex and singularly British story in which the arts, history, politics and changing ideas about national identity share the stage.The story begins in 1848, when the radical publisher Effingham Wilson published a pamphlet called A House for Shakespeare.His passionate plea for a national theatre seized the imagination and support of figures such as Charles Dickens and Matthew Arnold, but there was fierce opposition from powerful West End actor-managers who liked the non-subsidised status quo.National Theatre associate director Michael Blakemore said the real reason there was not a national theatre earlier was because the language was English."Now, if you run a theatre in say Denmark, then the performances and the productions' lives end at the border, since very few people in Europe speak your language, so the only way you can support a national theatre is with public money," he said."But in England, what happened was that a great actor like Henry Irving and all the great 19th Century actors had another market for their work and that market was the US and Australasia. They all went on tour and made a fortune so they didn't need to be supported by public money."Meanwhile, in the countries where there was a theatre subsidised by the state or court - such as the Comedie Francaise in France - the same classic plays tended to be performed again and again in the same old way.So, perhaps it helped that the London National was not established earlier by the state?Nicholas Hytner, the outgoing artistic director of the National, is proud of the range of its productions and wholeheartedly agrees."It was a very good thing that it was never set up by the court or by competing principalities looking to express their prestige through their theatres and opera houses and orchestras and dance companies. It's a good thing that it always bubbled up organically from underneath," he said.This bubbling up still took a surprisingly long time - with two World Wars intervening.Playwright Michael Frayn says the optimism of the period immediately after World War Two when other national institutions were established may have been key in getting the National Theatre off the ground."The war fostered the idea that you could actually collaborate as a nation, you could get together to think about how to live your life," he said."And this made possible after the war a lot of things like the National Health Service and the so-called welfare state which would have been impossible in the context of the 1930s, and maybe the National Theatre rode on the back of that."James Naughtie, the presenter of BBC radio programme Road to the National Theatre, believes in the powerful symbolic value of a third event."Post-war Britain was austere but exciting. From the rubble and the broken homes something better had to emerge. The National Theatre would become part of that process," he said,"The Festival of Britain, the centrepiece of post-war culture, was erected in 1951, on the anniversary of the Great Exhibition, intended as a symbol of recovery and a confident trumpet call."At long last, during that year, a foundation stone was laid. It still took until 1963 for the establishment of the National Theatre, and the Denys Lasdun building on the South Bank did not open its doors to audiences until 1976.What would Seymour Hicks - with his notion that less than half a dozen people believed in the idea of National Theatre - make of its success today?Last year, one and a half million people attended National Theatre shows, either on the South Bank or at West End transfers such as War Horse, One Man, Two Guvnors or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.And that is not to mention the latest venture - National Theatre Live - which last year beamed performances of productions such as Frankenstein and Hamlet to more than three million people in cinemas across the globe.The road may have been long, hard and boulder-strewn but, at a youthful 50, the National Theatre is more vibrant than ever.Listen to the Road to the National Theatre on BBC Radio 4 on 6 and 13 October at 13:30 BST, or hear it on iPlayer.</body>

      <title>Post-Yes defence plan 'would cost'</title>
      <description>The UK government believes establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.</description>

      <body>The UK government believes that establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.The claim will appear in the latest Coalition analysis paper prepared by UK civil servants.The Scottish government proposes a £2.5bn defence force if there is a "yes" vote next September.A spokesman said an independent Scotland would have first-class conventional forces.Meanwhile the BBC has seen an internal Ministry of Defence (MoD) briefing document on Scottish independence.It raised concerns about the effect a "yes" vote would have on England, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying the debate matters because of the potential effect of Scottish independence on "our politics, our economy, our standing" - referring to the rest of UK.The document also suggested that about 500,000 votes could "swing the result" of the referendum "either way".Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will promote the UK's current defence set-up during a speech in Edinburgh later.The 86-page analysis paper is being published after MPs on the Commons Defence Committee said it would be "remiss" of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) not to consider the implications of independence, including the future of Trident at the Faslane base.The document will focus on funding, jobs and the problems involved in splitting up an integrated military.The report concludes that the transition to an independent force would be complex.One extract from the analysis says: "Adapting the functions of Scotland's defence footprint would result in a substantial burden on the public finances of an independent Scottish state during establishment, and duplication of costs thereafter for the essential services currently provided on a UK-wide basis."It is difficult to predict how long the establishment phase would last, but given the complex, integrated nature of the UK armed forces and the absence of command and control structures and other essential components in Scotland, this would not be an easy process."Even basic re-design of military bases is a costly undertaking requiring substantial investment to cater for different operational needs."It added that negotiations over assets and liabilities such as equipment, basing and other infrastructure "would be difficult".The report also said that the issue of personnel would present an "extremely difficult challenge to overcome".However, the MoD said picking the UK military apart "would not be impossible".A Scottish government spokesman said he welcomed the "important acknowledgement" from the UK government that an independent Scotland would stand to "inherit a fair share of current UK defence assets".He added: "An independent Scotland will have first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and co-operating with international partners - but we will not waste billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons."We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane, which will be Scotland's main conventional naval facility, and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases."</body>

      <title>'House prices up' as demand grows</title>
      <description>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers forces house prices up in Scotland, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers has forced house prices up in Scotland, according to a monthly survey.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found house prices increased in September.Last month, 32% more respondents reported prices rises rather than falls in the Rics survey.A net balance of 78% more surveyors also reported an increase in new-buyer inquiries.However, Rics said the lack of homes coming onto the market resulted in the number of new instructions failing to keep pace with the "burgeoning" level of demand.Looking ahead, more than half of those surveyed expected prices to continue to rise in the next three months.Responding to the latest survey, Rics director Sarah Speirs said: "It's encouraging that the market is starting to improve in all parts of the country, with more buyers looking to make a move and more sales going through."Even so, it's a big concern that the supply of property coming to the market is lagging so far behind demand, particularly with the recent launch of Help to Buy in Scotland."This imbalance is likely to result in further upward pressure in prices over the coming months, particularly in popular areas."The report comes as it was revealed that house prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the last decade.Data from the Nationwide Building Society showed that the increase is only matched by Islington and Westminster in London.The growth in the north east has been largely put down to the expanding oil and gas industry and the workers it attracts to the area.</body>

      <body>Tram testing is due to start in Edinburgh between the depot at Gogar and Edinburgh Park Station.Pedestrians and drivers are being warned to take extra care on the roads at the points where the trams will cross.The test programme will build up gradually but eventually there will be more than 150 tram journeys a day along the line.The tests will continue until the service begins next year.The programme will allow the tram operators to carry out vital safety checks and will also give the public a chance to get used to seeing trams running on the city's streets.The council is warning people to take care, as the trams move quickly and quietly, and are wider than the tracks they run on.The test journeys will cross the road at two locations, Lochside Avenue and South Gyle Broadway.Cllr Lesley Hinds, the city's transport convener, said: "This is another significant step in the tram project and moves us closer towards completion."It will take some time for people to get used to seeing trams running on street and both pedestrians and drivers will need to take extra care while everyone becomes familiar with them."I've seen firsthand in Dublin how trams interact with traffic and as progress continues to be made along the route, it'll be important that people are aware of the differences."The tram service is due to be up and running for passengers in May 2014.Cllr Hinds added: "We'll bring this forward if we can."However, it's important to recognise the significance of this testing, commissioning and driver training programme. There is much to be done and it's vital that all the appropriate tests and checks are made."</body>

      <title>Council confronts green goal shift</title>
      <description>How one of the few councils in the UK to provide one wheelie bin per household for domestic rubbish is adapting to a change in waste legislation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-24380310</url>
      <date>1381191152</date>
      <body>Dumfries and Galloway Council is pretty unusual among UK local authorities - it provides just one wheelie bin per household.An Eco Deco facility, officially opened in 2007, allowed the region to move to single-bin collections.However, new regulations mean separate bins are being reintroduced and two new processing facilities are being built.MSPs have criticised the costs involved but the local authority insists it is a chance to make services "even better".Dumfries and Galloway Council signed a 25-year waste management Private Finance Initiative deal with Shanks Waste Management in 2004.The total Scottish executive commitment to the project over its duration was reported as more than £110m.The plant officially opened in late 2007, claiming to be the first of its kind in Scotland.It takes waste and breaks it down into five re-usable components - eliminating the need for homeowners to separate their own rubbish.Indeed, a 2011 study found the council was one of just two in the UK able to collect a single bin.But new rules mean a "fundamental change" is now needed.The Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2012 require the separate collection of paper, card, glass, metals and plastics for recycling - as well as food waste in most urban areas.It means that from one wheelie bin the local authority will start next year in rolling out five separate recycling containers to homes.It will cost almost £4m to implement, including the purchase of new collection vehicles and household bins.It will also see running costs of the service increase and two new waste management centres opened in Dumfries and Stranraer at a price of some £20m.Director of planning and environment services, Alistair Speedie, admitted it was a "fundamental change" but one the council would grasp "with both hands".He said the waste PFI contract had been "extremely successful" over nearly 10 years in operation."We have gone from diverting 5% of our waste away from landfill to now up to 66% so that has been a huge improvement," he said.Recycling rates have also gone from 4% to 21%."What has happened now is that the legislation has changed," he said."That legislation dictates that we have to collect our waste in a different manner."It is one of those things," he added. "It is no big deal. Legislation changes in all the services that we provide in the council regularly - for improvement, to better ourselves and to look after the environment - for all the right reasons."He added that the costs would not put pressure on council budgets with the Scottish government providing support to buy the bins and vehicles involved."How we pay for the rest of the infrastructure is quite simple - it is on a spend to save basis," he said."By diverting more and more waste away from landfill we will save a massive amount in landfill tax so that is what will pay for it."So there is no budget pressure on the council."He stressed, also, that the Eco Deco plant remained relevant despite the move away from single bin collection."The plant itself, Eco Deco, will still play a really important part in our whole system," he said."It is not that the plant is prejudiced in any way - the plant is there as the rock that we are building everything else on and it always will be."There has, however, been political concern about the costs involved in making the change.Conservative MSP for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale Alex Fergusson said he had been "horrified" by a "reinterpretation" of environmental values which meant kerbside recycling would have to return."The extra expense is massive," he said."I understand that council officials expect only around a 40% compliance with the new system, and I wonder where all these bins are going to sit on some of our pavements."He said he did not believe the whole situation had been handled well."This has all cost the council tax payers an exorbitant amount of unnecessary money, but it has been brought about by the Scottish government's inflexible interpretation of EU rules," he said.Lib Dem counterpart Jim Hume has also criticised the situation.He accused the Scottish government of "running roughshod" over local decision-making and "forcing the council's hand" into making another change."The council will now incur £24.5m capital costs at waste management centres, nearly £4m capital costs of new waste trucks and multiple bins, and not to mention an estimated yearly shortfall in revenue costs of £422,000 from 2015-16," he said."How Dumfries and Galloway meets its recycling targets in the future will depend largely on the public information campaign running alongside the new arrangements"But I fear this change has already met with huge public opposition and efforts to engage communities will have to be immense for the region to meet its targets; another costly exercise for the council to bear."Labour environment spokesman on Dumfries and Galloway Council, Colin Smyth, said his party had consistently made clear that dependence on the Eco Deco plant "was never likely to be acceptable to the Scottish government"."That is why we opposed the move to close recycling sites and scrap the doorstep 'blue box' recycling scheme three years ago but we were overruled by Tory and SNP councillors," he said."It's a bit rich of those same parties to now claim the council are the innocent victim of a change in legislation."They were warned this was always likely to be the government's direction of travel but they buried their head in the sand and hoped it wouldn't happen."He said the council should have been building up recycling alongside the use of the Eco Deco plant.He said the U-turn was now going to cost the "hard pressed taxpayer a fortune".A Scottish government spokesman defended the goals it has set for councils."The Scottish government's Zero Waste Plan is one of the most ambitious waste policies in Europe," he said."Under that plan we now have measures that will significantly increase the recycling and reprocessing of key materials and in doing so reduce demand on primary resources and deliver new economic opportunities for Scotland."It is for local authorities to decide how they deliver services to meet these requirements."He said that support was available to help councils meet their targets."Greater recycling levels will deliver economic and environmental benefits to Scotland and overall savings to local authorities," he said."All councils in Scotland are working towards delivering these requirements and they can access funding and support from Zero Waste Scotland to help implement any changes required."A Zero Waste Scotland statement said it had supported the council to "review its recycling services and to implement changes needed to ensure it complies with new waste regulations"."The regulations are designed to maximise high quality recycling, which is about securing the best outcomes for the economy and the environment," it said."By introducing separate recycling collections the council is maximising the potential to create jobs and economic benefits from the materials people throw away."Most people want to do the right thing by recycling and it's important that people get behind these new services and support high-quality recycling."Shanks declined the opportunity to comment on the issue.As for homeowners, they will start to see the effects from next year as the new bin provision is rolled out across the region.</body>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female panda is continuing to show signs of pregnancy and has started to produce colostrum - a form of breast milk.However, veterinary experts at the zoo said the signs were "not 100% indicative of pregnancy".Staff had initially identified a two week window at the start of September where it had been expected that Tian Tian would deliver a cub or cubs.Four weeks on and staff said the panda could still be expecting.Simon Girling, head of veterinary services for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "We know it seems hard to believe after all this time, but Tian Tian, our female giant panda, is still continuing to show signs of being in the late term of pregnancy."Her behaviour has mellowed out over the past few days, which is a very positive sign and she has also started to produce colostrum."Colostrum is a high-calorie milk containing antibodies, which protects newborns from infectious diseases.It is produced by mammals (including humans) in late pregnancy and for the first few days after birth, before normal milk starts.However, Mr Girling said it could simply be sign of Tian Tian experiencing a pseudo-pregnancy.Zookeepers have said they were confident Tian Tian did conceive, but hormone analysis has been unclear about whether she was still carrying a cub.Meanwhile, Yang Guang, the zoo's male panda, has been unwell for a number of weeks.Mr Girling said he may have a minor metabolic disorder."Since starting a regime of supplements he has shown significant improvement and his keepers are really happy with him," he said."We expect him to recover in a matter of weeks."</body>

      <title>Moore sacked in Lib Dem reshuffle</title>
      <description>Scottish Secretary Michael Moore is sacked in a Lib Dem reshuffle and will be replaced by fellow Scot Alistair Carmichael.</description>

      <body>Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has been sacked in a reshuffle of the Liberal Democrats' senior team at Westminster.He is being replaced by the Lib Dems' current chief whip, Alistair Carmichael.The move comes less than a year before the people of Scotland vote in a referendum on independence.Mr Moore is thought to be the only cabinet minister on the Lib Dem side of the coalition to lose his job.The party's UK leader Nick Clegg said that someone with a "different experience" was needed in the final year running up to the referendum itself.BBC Scotland's political editor Brian Taylor blogged that Mr Carmichael has a "secure reputation as a combative Lib Dem chief whip" plus a "dry wit and a cool head".The MP for Orkney and Shetland was appointed a whip following the coalition agreement in 2010.In September last year he took over from Jo Swinson as deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.BBC Scotland's Westminster correspondent Tim Reid reported that Mr Moore believed he had done his job "pretty effectively" and that he was "very disappointed" by the move.Mr Moore tweeted that it had been a great privilege to serve as Scottish secretary and he wished Mr Carmichael "all the best".After the news broke, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her "best wishes" to Mr Moore.She added: "A tough opponent but always pleasant. He can take pride in the achievement of the Edinburgh Agreement."Mr Moore is constituency MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk and has served at Westminster since 1997.He played a key role in the negotiations which led to the Edinburgh Agreement in October last year.The deal set out terms for a Scottish independence referendum and was signed by Prime Minister David Cameron and First Minister Alex Salmond in Scotland's capital.Liberal Democrat party leader Nick Clegg has thanked Mr Moore for his work in the post, which he was given three years ago.In a letter to the MP, Mr Clegg said: "Not only have you successfully piloted through legislation to enable Scotland to take a major step towards the party's long held goal of Home Rule, but you have also ensured that the referendum next year will give the Scottish people a clear and decisive question on which to cast their vote."It should be recognised that you secured both the Scotland Act and the Edinburgh Agreement in the context of a majority SNP government at Holyrood, and against a backdrop of an external political narrative that often suggested the legislation would fail and a referendum agreement could not be secured."He added: "I believe we now need to draw on different experience in the final year running up to the referendum itself and I am keen that just as we have benefited from your formidable skills over the past three years that we take advantage of other experience within our ranks during this period."Mr Moore responded by saying it was a "hugely important" time for Scottish politics.In a letter to Mr Clegg, he said that taking the Scotland Act through parliament and negotiating the Edinburgh Agreement had been highlights of his time in office.He added: "Over the last few years I have worked with a superb team of civil servants and advisers in the Scotland Office, and other government departments, in very challenging circumstances."I do not think the support teams for ministers always get the credit they deserve: I am very grateful for the support they have given me."In leaving the Scotland Office I am pleased that Alistair will be succeeding me. As a good friend and long time colleague, I believe he will do a superb job. I wish him all the best."Following Mr Carmichael's appointment, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran, said: "I welcome Alistair Carmichael to his new post and pay tribute to Michael Moore. We frequently disagreed, but he has made a significant contribution to the referendum debate and Scottish politics over the past two years."Meanwhile, in other reshuffle news concerning Scots MPs, Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from that post to the international development brief.The announcement was made by Labour Party leader Ed Miliband who, along with the Lib Dems and the Tories, have begun reshuffling their top team.</body>

      <title>Union 'fiddling while Rome burns'</title>
      <description>Ineos accuses the Unite union at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant of "fiddling while Rome burns".</description>

      <body>Ineos has accused unions at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant of "fiddling while Rome burns".Workers have started an overtime ban and work to rule in a dispute centred on the treatment of a union convener.Unite the Union has called for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes.Ineos has warned the Grangemouth facility will close by 2017 if it does not find savings and fresh investment.It said the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government would make all efforts to bring both sides together to help resolve the dispute, and get to a position of financial sustainability for the plant.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said: "We have been talking to the company about how we might be able to invest to support the development of the plant."We can only make investment if there is a viable business proposition and that's where we need to have all parties working together to support a proposition that can deliver the employment and the opportunities that we want to see for the plant in Grangemouth, because of its very wider significance for the Scottish economy."Unite workers voted for the industrial action in support of Unite convener Stevie Deans.He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over allegations linked to his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party.Mr Deans faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.Unite have accused Ineos of trying to "provoke" a strike, which it warned would be "hugely damaging" to the UK economy.A previous three-day stoppage at the site in 2008 was said to have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in lost production and other knock-on effects.Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike - and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said the company was using the Stevie Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes, job losses, an end to collective bargaining and worse pay and conditions for new employees.Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians, and urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating."The company is holding Stevie Deans hostage, and playing Russian roulette with fuel supplies," Mr Rafferty said."The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action."We are trying to make the company see sense, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage."Unite said the work to rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.Chairman Calum MacLean has warned "there is no plan B".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Tom Crotty, group director with Ineos, said: "We have got a survival plan. We haven't been sitting on our hands wailing about it, we are doing something about it."What we can do is invest in new terminal facilities that will allow us to bring gas in from the US to replace the gas from the North Sea."But to do that we will have to put another £300m into a site that is losing £10m a month, and we will not do that unless we can sort out this cost base."He added: "While this crucial issue is facing us, which will close the site before 2017 unless something is done, Unite are ignoring it and focusing on this issue about Steven Deans."It is frankly fiddling while Rome burns."On Sunday, the company announced that one of its key customers in Hull, which traditionally took up to 100,000 tonnes of product from Grangemouth, had been forced to close down.The Ineos Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Vam) facility at Saltend said that low cost imports into Europe had made closure inevitable.Mr MacLean said: "Unfortunately the closure of this world-scale Vam unit at the Hull site has a significant knock-on effect at Grangemouth as we lose a major customer for good."</body>

      <title>Alcohol cravings drug gets approval</title>
      <description>Scotland becomes the first country in Europe to prescribe a new drug which reduces cravings for alcohol in heavy drinkers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24431152</url>
      <date>1381166395</date>
      <body>Scotland has become the first country in Europe to prescribe a new drug which reduces cravings for alcohol.Nalmefene has been given the go-ahead by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), which approves drugs for use on the NHS.It is designed for people who are heavy drinkers but not the most severely-dependent alcoholics.The SMC said it should only be prescribed alongside psychological support.In trials, men who normally drank eight units of alcohol a day and women who drank six a day reduced their consumption by half over a six-month period when they took nalmefene.It comes in the form of a pill which is designed to be taken before drinking, not necessarily every day. Nalmefene costs £3 per tablet.It reduces the release of dopamine in the brain, lessening the "buzz" or reward sensation associated with alcohol.Prof Jonathan Chick, consultant psychiatrist at Queen Margaret University Hospital Edinburgh, said: "I am pleased that Scottish patients will have access to nalmefene, which represents a new option for treating some people with alcohol dependence by helping them to cut down their drinking when they may not be ready, or have no medical need, to give up alcohol altogether."This may help us to engage the many alcohol-dependent patients that we know are not currently receiving help."Scotland has the highest alcohol-related death rate in the UK. The rates in Scottish men are double that of the rest of the UK.The SMC said nalmefene was licensed for the reduction of alcohol consumption "in adult patients with alcohol dependence without physical withdrawal symptoms and who do not require immediate detoxification".The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies drinking risk levels (DRLs) into low, medium, high and very high, where high risk equates to about seven and a half units of alcohol per day for men and five units per day for women.The consortium said: "Nalmefene should only be prescribed in conjunction with continuous psychosocial support focused on treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption."Nalmefene should be initiated only in patients who continue to have a high DRL two weeks after initial assessment."Prof Chick added: "The range of people who put themselves at risk through their drinking is quite wide. Some have not met social problems and are functioning well until they develop an alcohol-related physical illness such as high blood pressure, cancer or liver disease; while others lose their social supports and then tend to fit the stereotype of the 'alcoholic'."Reducing alcohol consumption can prevent these social and physical damages developing, but the changes in the brain of the dependent drinker may make that difficult and help is needed."</body>

      <body>Rangers chief executive Craig Mather and finance director Brian Stockbridge have held discussions in South Africa with Dave King over the club's future.King invested heavily during Sir David Murray's Ibrox reign and maintained interest during recent club events.But issues with South African tax authorities prevented him from playing a more significant role.King recently agreed to pay almost £44m to the Revenue Service as criminal charges against him were dropped.A spokesman for the Rangers board told BBC Scotland: "Craig Mather and Brian Stockbridge have been meeting a number of investors."Craig is returning from South Africa tonight (Monday) and has also been in Dubai. Brian was in South Africa last week."King did not wish to comment when contacted by BBC Scotland.He has, however, spoken in recent weeks of his desire to invest in Rangers.The Glasgow-born businessman has been a fierce critic of both Charles Green, who led a purchase of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club Plc, and Craig Whyte, whose ownership ended with that company going into administration and then liquidation.You can follow Alasdair on Twitter: @BBCAlLamont </body>

      <body>A council has been fined £48,000 for health and safety breaches after an incident in which a schoolgirl was dragged into a lathe by her scarf.Nadine Craig, who was 14 at the time, was pulled into the machine in November 2007 and freed by fellow pupils.She received 40 stitches to a wound in her neck and it was six months before she returned to Galashiels Academy.At Selkirk Sheriff Court, Scottish Borders Council admitted failing to provide a proper guard for the lathe.It also admitted not carrying out risk assessments on machines in the Craft and Design Technology classes over a period of almost three years.The council had said there had been "tension" with the teacher over risk assessments as he stated he was not trained nor had the time to carry them out.In his findings, Sheriff Kevin Drummond said: "It was wrong of him to fail to comply and it was wrong of the authority to allow it to continue."He also pointed out a guard was available for the machine which could have been purchased for £260 plus fitting costs.Sheriff Drummond described the offences as a "serious failure" and said the gravity of the breach meant he would impose a fine of £72,000.He awarded the council full credit for the early guilty plea and reduced the fine to £48,000.At an earlier hearing the council said the teacher was "removed from classroom duties after this incident and shortly afterwards took early retirement".Ms Craig, now 20, was awarded £27,000 when a civil claim for damages was settled in 2011.However, she said she was unhappy with how the matter had been handled."It was terrifying at the time - I could have died," she said."I don't feel like I've had justice because no one personally has been made accountable for this."I have to live with this scar for the rest of my life and it is something I am ashamed of people seeing."A council spokesman said the authority had offered an "unreserved apology" to Ms Craig."The council has accepted its responsibility, having made an early plea in court, and a full safety review of technical classes in all secondary schools was carried out immediately after the accident," he added.</body>

      <body>A man who admitted posting offensive remarks online about murdered Welsh schoolgirl April Jones has been ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.Liam Young, 25, from Ardrossan, North Ayrshire, made the comments on Facebook during the search for the five-year-old, whose body has never been found.He admitted disorderly conduct by sending indecent and offensive remarks.Mark Bridger, 47, was jailed for life for abducting April near her home in Machynlleth, Powys, and murdering her.A massive police operation was launched after April went missing on 1 October 2012 while playing near her home.Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard how two days into the search, Young was involved in a three-way conversation on Facebook in which each participant was "trying to be more shocking than the other".Young's lawyer Graeme Cunningham told the court: "Mr Young probably won with his message, as shocking and stupid as it was."Referring to his client he said: "He apologises unreservedly and a lesson has been learned, to the extent that he was photographed leaving court and his picture, with some unpleasant comments about him, was plastered across the national and UK newspapers."The articles written about him were less than flattering, and rightly so."The repercussions already visited upon him are far more damaging than other punishments."The court heard how Young was sacked from his council job after his employers found out about the offence.Passing sentence, Sheriff Brian Murphy told Young: "It concerns me that someone believes they can say what they like on Facebook because they live in a democratic society."I trust you will leave here knowing the right to freedom of speech is not unlimited."What you said was deeply offensive and you lost your job over this."An arrest warrant was earlier issued for co-accused Gordon Mullen, 24, of Saltcoats, who denies a similar charge arising from the same incident.In May, Bridger was convicted at Mold Crown Court of April's abduction, murder, and perverting the course of justice. He was given a whole life term.</body>

I didn't know what to say."My manager was a friend of Ian's so I didn't know who I could go and speak to about it."Another office worker claimed Mr Paterson would visit the room where she worked and touch her co-worker inappropriately.The 34-year-old woman said she also witnessed him assaulting a woman at a charity Christmas party while his wife was sitting next to him in the nightclub.The trial at Aberdeen Sheriff Court continues.</body>

      <title>Lennox calls for pop video ratings</title>
      <description>Pop star Annie Lennox describes modern pop videos as "pornographic", and says they should be subject to a ratings system.</description>

      <date>1381165254</date>
      <body>Pop star Annie Lennox has described the sexualised imagery of modern pop videos as "dark" and "pornographic"."I'm all for freedom of expression," she told BBC Radio 5 live, "but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn.""How do you stop your kids being exposed to it? It's so powerful. You don't want to see your seven-year-old girls twerking all over the place."The singer has called for pop videos to be rated in the same way as films.She previously wrote on her Facebook page that if a pop star created "a soft porn video or highly sexualised live performance, then it needs to qualify as such and be X-rated for adults only".She told 5 live pressure from parents could help to establish "very clear boundaries" on acceptable standards in videos.Her comments fuelled a debate started by Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with singer Robin Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger.That performance, and a similarly risque video for her single Wrecking Ball, prompted Sinead O'Connor to write an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business.Artists such as Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna have also been criticised for explicit performances and costumes in the past.Lennox did not single out any one performer for criticism - referring instead to a "recent spate of overtly sexualised performances and videos" in her Facebook statement."I have nothing against these artists," she told 5 live's Anna Foster. "I was never bashing them."There's nothing wrong with sexuality and sensuality and I think these artists are beautiful. And, in many ways, what they do is fantastic, but it needs to be age-appropriate."These guys have young fan bases and they are being barraged with it."I don't think there's one parent of young boys and girls in this country that would honestly, comfortably say they were fine with seeing their kids being exposed to that kind of thing.""I think this debate is about getting the voice of reason back there to say 'look, we want to protect our kids.'"</body>

      <body>Four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti has fractured his spine and broken his right ankle in a high-speed crash at the Houston Grand Prix.The Scot, 40, suffered multiple fractures after hitting the track wall.His car flipped into the air following a final-lap collision with Takuma Sato, with at least 13 spectators injured by debris that flew over safety fencing.Franchitti's team owner Chip Ganassi said: "His ankle and back are a little sore. He is going to be okay."Franchitti tweeted   later: "Thank you to everyone for all the well wishes. They mean a lot to me. I would also like to send my best to all the fans involved in the accident and hope that everyone is alright."Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner hit the back of Sato's car and was propelled into the air and against the fence. His car exploded into several pieces but did not catch fire.Former Formula 1 driver Sato said his car "caught the marbles" - chunks of rubber that come off the tyres and lie on the track - before brushing the wall and losing momentum."A couple of cars passed me as I was offline and in turn five," said the Japan star. "I got very loose and Dario and I came together."IndyCar later released a statement confirming Franchitti was awake on his arrival at the hospital and would be monitored overnightThe statement read: "IZOD IndyCar Series driver Dario Franchitti was admitted awake and alert to Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center in Houston for a concussion, spinal fracture that will require no surgery and a fracture to the right ankle. He will be kept overnight."Actress Ashley Judd, who married Franchitti in 2001, though the pair separated earlier this year, tweeted that she was on her way to Houston to see him.Race promoters said 11 spectators were treated at the track while two more were transferred to hospital for evaluation.Franchitti's former team-mate Dan Wheldon, from England, died in a crash at the Las Vegas Indy 300 in October 2011.Will Power, who won the Grand Prix, said the accident reminded him of the Las Vegas crash, where he and Wheldon both hit the fence."Yes, that's what it reminded me of," he said. "I just saw Dario's car and him sitting in it with a lot of damage. I hate seeing that. We try to keep these cars on the ground."Franchitti's team-mate Scott Dixon, who leads the overall standings, echoed Power's thoughts."The smells and the visuals, you have the remnants of Vegas popping into your head, with you coming around the corner and you can't drive through it because there's a field of debris," he said."There was nowhere near the amount of damage that we saw (in 2011), but seeing the replay was a big shock."</body>

      <body>Preparations are under way to ensure drivers are kept moving on Scotland's roads this winter.Almost 200 vehicles are available for spreading salt and ploughing trunk roads in the event of ice and snow, transport minister Keith Brown said.Salt stocks have been maintained and supplies of specialist de-icers which work in even lower temperatures have been increased.There are also additional frontline and patrol vehicles available.A dedicated adviser from the Met Office has also been installed at the National Traffic Scotland control centre in South Queensferry, West Lothian, which opened earlier this year.The public will be kept up to date with information on road conditions via the Traffic Scotland website and social media sites.Weather stations are now located across the country and mobile sensors are fitted to operational vehicles to feed back data on road temperatures and conditions.They will be used by the road-operating companies to decide when routes need to be treated.Speaking during a tour of the control centre, Mr Brown said: "Last winter, the Met Office issued 169 severe weather warnings for Scotland and that gives an indication of some of the challenges that we could face during the next few months."Our trunk roads play a vital part in our daily lives and that doesn't change with the seasons, so Transport Scotland and our road-operating companies do everything we can to keep the country moving, even during the most testing of conditions."Our new national control centre means that our response to major incidents like severe storms will be better co-ordinated under one roof with experts from all across the transport network working alongside each other."</body>

      <date>1381123038</date>
      <body>The mother of a man who was hit by an HGV then dragged underneath it for three miles has appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact police.Robert Finlayson, 22, was found dead on the B7078 Carlisle Road in Blackwood, Lanarkshire, on Monday 23 September.It is thought he had been trying to hitchhike when he was struck.His mother Angela said his family could not move on until they knew exactly what had happened.Police believe Mr Finlayson - who was known as Robbie - was hit by an unmarked light-coloured Mercedes Actros tractor unit towing a tri-axle rigid step framed trailer.They said it was possible the driver was not aware the vehicle had struck him.Mrs Finlayson said she could not get her son's body back for burial until the police investigation into his death came to a conclusion.Describing how she had last seen him on the Saturday before he died, she said: "I said I would see him later that night because I was going to work, and that was the last time I saw him."I really just can't put it into words how much we'll miss him, every aspect of his life. How can you put into words how important one person is?"Some days it's just like he'll be through the door for his dinner, other days we realise that he won't be."We can't move on because we can't do anything, we can't put Robbie to rest therefore we are just sitting waiting as well."I think for his brothers and for all the rest of the family its important that we have this conclusion, that we all know what happened so that we can piece together Robbie's last movements and understand what happened to him."Mr Finlayson, from Hamilton, was seen on CCTV at about 04:10, standing on the north side of the over bridge of the M74 motorway Junction 10 and then heading north on the northbound carriageway of the B7078, where it appears he was attempting to hitchhike.The road was busier than normal because of a diversion from the nearby M74 motorway.More than 40 vehicles, many of them heavy goods vehicles delivering to large retail outlets, were diverted from the motorway onto the B7078 between 04:00 and 04:30.Several northbound vehicles were seen moving onto the opposing lane to pass Mr Finlayson safely, but police said he was then struck by a vehicle and carried underneath it for three miles to where his body was found.Mrs Finlayson said: "There's only one thing we can do for Robbie and that is to find out what happened and that everything is dealt with and then be able to bury him."We can't do that for him until we get this information that we need, and that comes from the drivers that were on that road that night."So that is what we need - for people to come forward and give what information they can about anything they saw."Even if they think it is quite trivial it could be important to the police just to pinpoint a time or narrow the timescale down when this accident happened".Insp Calum Maider, of Police Scotland, emphasised that, although all of the drivers on the road at the time were potential witnesses, he was not looking for an accused or a suspect at this point.He added: "Our focus at this present time is on a heavy goods vehicle, which I fully believe would have been unaware of striking Robbie."We have retrieved an item of front trim from the vehicle. That has been identified as coming from a Mercedes Actros tractor unit, so therefore we are looking for that particular type of vehicle."</body>

      <body>The army of volunteers enlisted to help during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow will be known as Clyde-siders.Organiser Glasgow 2014 said the title would be given to 15,000 people who had been chosen to help out from a total of 50,811 who had offered their services.Successful applicants for Clyde-siders positions will begin hearing about their offers from Monday.The 11-day games, which begin on 23 July 2014, will see 4,500 athletes compete in 17 sports across 14 venues.The name Clyde-siders was chosen by the Glasgow 2014 frontrunners, the pre-Games volunteers who conducted all of the volunteer interviews.Glasgow 2014 said the first offers were now going out to people for those roles where all interviews had been completed.It urged applicants to be patient, however, as interviews for other Clyde-siders positions will continue until December.Among the first Clyde-siders appointed are Emma Blore, 23, from Dumfries and Galloway, and 31-year-old Katherine Spoors, from Newcastle.Emma has been assigned to Commonwealth Games Association relations at the Athletes Village."I live in a tiny village In Dumfries and Galloway called Mossdale and what I'm looking forward to most in Glasgow is the atmosphere," she said."At London 2012, I volunteered as part of the athletes services team based in Glasgow looking after the men's football teams and their delegations and everyone I met was really friendly."I want everyone who visits to feel right at home in Glasgow and hope to experience a great camaraderie with the other volunteers and staff."Katherine said: "I went to the London 2012 football as a spectator and was struck by how friendly the volunteers were at the venue and that really stayed with me."As soon as the volunteer applications opened back in January 2013 I knew I wanted to be a part of the Commonwealth Games experience and help the beautiful city of Glasgow put on an amazing show."I'll be working as part of spectator services so I will be making sure everyone who attends the games has a brilliant and unforgettable time."Lord Smith of Kelvin, chair of Glasgow 2014, said he appreciated the "time and commitment shown by all candidates" who had been chosen for interview."I am confident those selected will enjoy what is a fantastic opportunity to become a part of the games and will help to deliver its success," he said."The Clyde-siders, as our volunteers are to be known, will be the friendly faces of the games, the first point of contact for many people, and are bound to inject their personalities into the event."It was also confirmed that the Legacy 2014 Volunteer Support Pot was now open.The discretionary fund will provide help to volunteers whose circumstances mean they need assistance towards the cost of taking part.Commonwealth Games Minister Shona Robison said the Clyde-siders would help make the event "the best ever Commonwealth Games by creating a fantastic welcome for athletes, spectators and visitors"."For those Clyde-siders who may need extra support, like those with a disability or care responsibilities, the £500,000 Legacy 2014 Volunteer Support Pot is now open," she said."It will help Scottish volunteers to overcome practical and financial barriers to help make their volunteering dreams a reality and provide valuable new skills and experiences.</body>

      <body>An Inverness-shire man has been named the world's best porridge maker for the second time in three years.John Boa took the prize at the 20th Annual Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, Inverness-shire.The trophy goes to the maker of the best traditional porridge using only oatmeal, salt and water.Mr Boa told BBC Scotland his win was "a little overwhelming".He said this was only the third time he had entered the competition. He also won in 2011."I'm very proud and privileged. And it does make it a little bit special that it's a landmark year for the competition," he added.Mr Boa, who formerly lived in Edinburgh but now lives on Skye, said the trick to producing a world-class porridge was to "keep stirring", using a spurtle - a rod-shaped tool, traditionally used to stir porridge.He also said adding the salt was "always a key moment"."You have to make sure you don't oversalt or undersalt," he said. "It has to be just right."This year the speciality award was won by London-based Nick Barnard for his recipe for fruity date porridge, which used dried apricots, dates, apples and cinnamon.Past recipes in the speciality section have included the use of curry powder, sausages and seafood.</body>

      <body>A pair of armed robbers who carried out two knifepoint robberies at shops in Aberdeen have been jailed for a total of more than 13 years.Jason King, 20, was jailed for seven years and nine months after being found guilty. Scott Gartshore, 23, received six years after admitting his role.The robberies were at RS McColls in Bervie Brow, Cove, and Spar on North Deeside Road, Peterculter, in January.Gartshore was jailed for another year for refusing to name his accomplices.Sentencing the pair at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Doherty said: "These were terrifying incidents for the shop workers involved."In the RS McColls raid, a knife was put to the throat of one of the employees.More than £1,600 was stolen, along with of cigarettes and alcohol.During the second raid, £7,500 and alcohol was taken.Gartshore was called as a witness at King's trial after admitting his involvement.He was found in contempt of court while giving his evidence for refusing to say who his two accomplices were.Defence counsel Derick Nelson said: "Mr Gartshore was in debt to drug dealers and committed these offences in a bid to pay off his debt."Advocate Frances Connor, representing King, said her client continued to maintain his innocence.Det Insp Lorna Ferguson, who led the enquiry, said: "In both of these incidents members of the public have clearly endured an ordeal that no-one should be exposed to and thankfully nobody was injured during these despicable crimes."The refusal by King to admit what he had done at an early stage caused further distress to the witnesses who have been forced to relive the incident in court."I welcome the sentences given to Gartshore and King and reinforce the message that violent crimes such as these will not be tolerated in our city."I would also like to thank those within the communities who came forward to assist the police during the investigation."</body>

      <body>A survivor of the Super Puma crash off Shetland has told how the helicopter hit the water seconds after a "hell of a noise".James Nugent said August's crash - which left four people dead - had left him with mental scars.It comes as a leading official from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said he is due to meet counterparts in Norway in the coming days.The aims is to see if lessons can be learned on helicopter safety.Investigations into the CHC-operated Super Puma AS332 L2 crash off Shetland, and offshore helicopters operations, are ongoing.The crash was the fifth accident in four years, two of which caused deaths.Mr Nugent told BBC Scotland: "There was a hell of a noise and twisting in the fuselage."We realised there was something really wrong with the helicopter."About four seconds later we were hitting the surface of the water hard. Water was rushing into the fuselage. We had crashed."He said he managed to escape after trying to help colleagues, but was now struggling to go near helicopters.The CAA's Mark Swan said of the forthcoming talks: "We will be looking at best practice procedures with the Norwegians."Sarah Darnley, 45, of Elgin; Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness; Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland; and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, lost their lives in the Shetland incident.There have been no deaths involving helicopters serving the Norwegian oil and gas sector since 1997.</body>

      <body>Police officers were twice warned about a drink-driver before a crash which left a pedestrian with serious injuries, an investigation has found.The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said officers failed to carry out checks despite the alarm being raised in the hours before the accident in Forfar in June.The Tayside Division officers were also using out-of-date intelligence systems.Police Scotland said any concerns would be addressed.The force had asked the PIRC to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident on 1 June, in which a 30-year-old woman was seriously injured.The driver involved in the crash was arrested and admitted various road traffic offences, including driving while under the influence of drink or drugs.Police officers had twice been provided with information by a member of the public about the man's fitness to drive.The commissioner, Professor John McNeill, said the officers did not obtain enough information, and did not circulate correct information.In addition, they did not carry out intelligence checks on the national police Scottish Intelligence Database which would have provided information that may have helped them stop and arrest the driver before the crash.The investigation also revealed that Tayside Division staff were accessing an old intelligence system which included out-of-date information.Professor McNeill said: "My investigation has revealed a number of areas of concern in relation to how Police Scotland handled this incident."There are clearly lessons to be learned by individual officers, but there are wider issues that should be addressed - specifically in relation to the use of out-of-date intelligence systems by Tayside Division."Police Scotland said: "We will consider the findings carefully and make sure that any concerns are addressed.''</body>

      <body>A detailed inquiry is to be carried out into the future of councils and local services in Scotland.Cosla has announced details of a commission which will examine how councils and local services might evolve.Its remit is to examine ways of strengthening local democracy across the country, regardless of the result of the independence referendum.Members will include councillors, academics and journalists.Cosla hopes it will result in a blueprint for how local government might evolve in the discussions about the future of Scotland after the referendum - whether that means the shaping of an independent country's constitution, devising a "devo max" settlement or simply improving existing arrangements.The local government organisation's president, David O'Neill, said: "The bottom line is that local matters and it is valued within our communities. Making Scotland a fairer, healthier and wealthier place will not be achieved from the top down - we know that trying to do so simply does not work."He added: "The reality is that empowering lives in our communities means empowering local democracy and letting local people decide on their priorities, their services and their spending."As well as Mr O'Neill, the commission has 20 other members. They include councillors from across Scotland, representatives of voluntary groups, STUC general secretary Graham Smith, the academic Prof Richard Kerley and the editor of the Daily Record newspaper Alan Rennie.Some in local government fear that since devolution in 1999 there has been a trend towards the "creep centralisation" of services in Scotland.They would argue that unrelated measures such as the terms of the council tax freeze and the creation of national police and fire services have, when taken together, weakened local accountability.Some councillors argue devolution did not just mean a transfer of power from Westminster to Holyrood but from town halls to the Scottish government.Mr O'Neill is keen to see a form of "constitutional protection" for local government in Scotland after the independence question is settled.He believes central government and local government should have guaranteed responsibilities - at the moment councils could, in theory at least, be abolished by Holyrood.Mr O'Neill describes the need for "spheres of influence - not tiers of influence". In other words, he would want a formal mechanism to ensure that central government recognised the responsibility of councils to make certain decisions or provide local services."He said: "Over the decades we have moved away from the local aspect of almost everything. More and more services are being run by distant bureaucracies and often these services are being done to people rather than delivered with them."Yet, across Europe the opposite is often true. That trend simply won't see us through for much longer because it is no coincidence that our European neighbours are often more successful at improving outcomes."One question might concern the details of local government finance. At present around 80p of every pound each council spends comes directly from the Scottish government.Most of the rest comes from the council tax but the terms of the council tax freeze - due to last until 2016 - make it difficult to raise extra money to a significant level.Because of this, many councils feel their hands are tied when it comes to money. Some would like to have more financial flexibility to minimise the need for continuing austerity and hard decisions on local spending. This could mean, for instance, greater flexibility over business rates.Another question might be whether all councils should have the same set of powers - or if they should vary depending on local circumstances.The three island authorities are currently arguing for additional powers while the councils responsible for Scotland's cities are examining the case for extra economic powers and responsibilities.The commission might also look at ways of "devolving" power from councils to local communities.But it is unlikely to make recommendations about redrawing the map of Scotland's 32 councils while decisions to share local services - either by pooling them with neighbouring authorities or other public services - are likely to be left to individual councils.The commission intends to try to gather evidence from all across Scotland.But one challenge might simply be engaging the broader public in the debate. Just 38% of voters took part in last year's council elections.Another might be the extent to which it is possible to devolve real power to communities. Community councils have no formal legal responsibilities but exist to feed into local authority decision making.Supporters say they can make a real difference to the people they serve but in many parts of the country, community councils are lying moribund through apparent lack of interest.The commission's report is expected in the spring.In the event of Scots rejecting independence, it would be largely be up to the Scottish government to decide whether to put any of the commission's recommendations into practice.However it is possible the commission may also urge some council control over the practicalities of welfare delivery and other services which Westminster is responsible for.In the event of a no vote, Cosla might hope to convince Westminster that any move to give Scotland more power did not automatically mean transferring more power to the Scottish Parliament.Were there to be a vote in favour of independence, the report might play a part in the debate over what an independent Scotland would actually be like.</body>

      <title>Energy hotline campaign launched</title>
      <description>A campaign is launched by the Scottish government to help make homes in Scotland more energy efficient.</description>

      <date>1381102450</date>
      <body>A campaign has been launched to help make Scottish homes more energy efficient.The Scottish government has made £74m available for home improvements such as insulation, boilers or central heating.It is offering free impartial energy advice and support through a home energy hotline.The government said many people were not aware they might be eligible for cash back on home improvements which increase energy efficiency.The campaign to raise awareness of the hotline and the financial help that is available was launched by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.She said: "Many people are losing money by not taking up initiatives yet anyone can apply for up to £1,200 towards home improvements that will make their home warmer, greener and more cost-effective."Many people will also qualify to get energy-saving home improvements such as insulation, boilers or central heating for free."The hotline's advisers are friendly and impartial, and one call is all it takes to see what you might be eligible for."Citizens Advice Scotland chief executive Margaret Lynch said: "We see many people who are worried about paying their gas and electricity bills. And we know that around one-third of Scottish households are in fuel poverty - an astonishingly high figure."The good news is that there are quite a number of schemes that help people who are struggling to pay their fuel bills."The bad news is that many consumers don't know about them, and so don't apply to them and instead suffer the cold, or debt, or both."We have called in the past for the government to find ways of setting this information out in a clear, straightforward and impartial way. This new helpline will hopefully do that."More than 800,000 people have received energy advice or help on heating bills since 2009 through the Home Energy Scotland hotline.A recent YouGov survey suggested that three-quarters of Scottish billpayers were concerned about the cost of their energy this winter while more than 70% said last winter's energy bills had a negative impact on their disposable income.</body>

      <title>UK upturn 'is gathering momentum'</title>
      <description>British Chambers of Commerce survey says the UK recovery is gaining pace, while a British Retail Consortium report underlines that some sectors remain fragile.</description>

      <date>1381220184</date>
      <body>UK companies saw sales and optimism jump in the third quarter, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).Service firms saw UK sales and orders rise at the fastest pace since 2007, while the rises for manufacturing were the sharpest since the early 1990s."It's clear that the UK upturn is gathering momentum," said David Kern, BCC chief economist.But a British Retail Consortium survey showed UK retail sales slowed for a second consecutive month in September."These figures are a reality check and will make retailers nervous as we enter the run up to Christmas," said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, which helped compile the BRC data.The British Chambers of Commerce said the results of its quarterly survey mean that it was likely to revise up its GDP forecasts for 2014.The quarterly survey is based based on responses from 7,400 companies, making it the UK's largest business survey.On the basis of the results, the BCC estimates that GDP growth will be in the region of 0.9% and 1% in the third quarter.The survey reported that employment prospects are brighter. A balance of 26% of services firms planned to increase staffing in the next three months, the highest reading since 2007.For manufacturing, the reading was 29%, the highest since the survey began in 1989.The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said in a statement: "It is fantastic to see our small yet dynamic manufacturing sector doing so well, with our results suggesting a recent growth spurt."However, we need to ensure that this does not become an aberration, but rather the norm, particularly when the economic recovery is still facing external risks."He said that levels of investment were still a concern, and that more support was needed for exporters through increased trade promotion and better access to finance."The Government mustn't get distracted, and has to put growth first at all times," Mr Longworth said."We will be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement in the hope that the chancellor uses this opportunity to make a real difference and go all out in the name of growth," he said.Meanwhile, the BRC data showed that like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in floor space as retailers open and close outlets - rose 0.7% in September. This was less than half the rate of growth of the previous two months.Grocery sales showed a weak performance in September, although sales of children's clothing and shoes put in a strong showing, due to the tail-end of the traditional back-to-school spending spree.The BRC said that a slowdown in food and drink sales reflected the tough battleground for market share. And the warm weather had also put people off spending on winter clothes."Consumers are still cautious about spending and are reluctant to restock their wardrobes with winter woollies until the weather cools," Mr McCorquodale said in a statement.The survey underlines that some sectors remain weak, despite a recent run of strong economic data.Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Morrisons and Next, remain cautious about the strength of the UK recovery.</body>

      <title>Banks 'most optimistic' in 17 years</title>

      <body>Optimism among UK banks and financial firms is at its highest for almost 17 years, a survey from the CBI business lobby group has suggested.Its quarterly survey, carried out with PricewaterhouseCoopers, found 59% of firms said they felt more optimistic, against 6% who were less optimistic.The balance, of 53%, is the highest since December 1996.The survey also found 24% of firms in the sector had increased staff numbers, the biggest rise in six years.The CBI/PwC survey of 99 companies covered the three months to the start of SeptemberThe study estimates that 10,000 jobs were added in the period studied, with another 2,000 expected to be created in the current quarter, taking total employment in the sector to 1.14 million.The one negative point came from business volumes, which the survey indicated had fallen in the latest quarter. Some 22% of firms reported a rise in business volumes, but 32% said they had fallen.Kevin Burrowes, from PwC's UK financial services division, said: "Banks' optimism is increasingly buoyant despite seeing a slight seasonal blip in commercial and industrial volumes."Activity and profitability are expected to grow as the economy recovers, and investment in new products and infrastructure is increasing."</body>

      <title>Cable defends Royal Mail pricing</title>
      <description>Business Scretary Vince Cable says Labour's Chuka Umunna is wrong to say the Royal Mail is being sold off too cheaply.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24437969</url>
      <date>1381177036</date>
      <body>Labour's Chuka Umunna is wrong to say Royal Mail is being sold too cheaply, Business Secretary Vince Cable says.In a letter to the shadow business secretary, Mr Cable says the price was set after "extensive consultation" with investors.His letter follows criticism that the sale price undervalues the business by up to £1bn.Mr Cable warns the criticism is "irresponsible" as it may imply an "easy bargain" is to be had.Earlier on Monday Mr Umunna told the BBC City investors and hedge funds would be the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering and that the sale was "short changing" taxpayers.He said stockbroker Panmure Gordon, which valued the business at £4.5bn, well above the government's top end price band of £3.3bn, was only one voice.In his letter, Mr Cable dismisses in detail many of Mr Umunna's criticisms and says that the price reflects the fact the business brings risks, as well as assets such as property.He says: "It is irresponsible to imply that a share offering looks significantly undervalued."I think you should consider the risk that you may be influencing the decisions of retail investors. Equity investment always involves risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there is an easy bargain to be made."Demand for the shares has been strong.On Friday, it was reported it was outstripping supply and they were to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested price range.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares were a "few times" the value of those on offer.Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the brokers through which investors can buy shares, said it would stay open until midnight on Tuesday to cope with the expected high demand.Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.Up to 62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds."The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares is very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold at between 300-330p.Members of the Communication Workers Union are being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.John Glen, senior lecturer in economics at the Cranfield School of Management suggested demand was being driven by a government guarantee of a £130m profit to shareholders next July, meaning shareholders would get a 6.5% return on their shares,."(It) is a good return given what you get if you put your money in the bank at the moment," he told BBC Breakfast.However, he noted that the privatisation was controversial. "Over the last six years, we the taxpayers have spent about £2.75bn making the Royal Mail more profitable, we've taken on £8bn of pension liabilities and of course there's the issue about whether or not the Royal Mail will guarantee to deliver to us every day, across the whole country, at a single price."</body>

      <title>Scotland wait for Anya injury news</title>
      <description>Ikechi Anya will have a thigh injury assessed when the Scotland squad gather on Wednesday for next week's game with Croatia.</description>

      <body>Ikechi Anya will have his thigh injury assessed when the Scotland squad gather on Wednesday for next week's World Cup qualifier with Croatia.The 25-year-old Watford wing-back impressed on his first international start last month, scoring in the 2-1 win away to Macedonia.Shaun Maloney and Steven Fletcher miss out through injury and Steven Whittaker is suspended.The match at Hampden next Tuesday will bring the campaign to a close.Scotland's chances of reaching Brazil next year fizzled out long ago, with just two wins from the nine games played.One of those successes came in Croatia in June, with Robert Snodgrass scoring the only goal in Zagreb.Anya, who was born in Glasgow and spent time in the lower leagues of England and Spain before his switch to Watford, made his Scotland debut as a substitute in the 2-0 loss to Belgium prior to the win in Macedonia.He appeared as a late replacement in Watford's 2-1 victory at Huddersfield on Saturday.</body>

      <title>IndyCar seeks to make races safer</title>
      <description>IndyCar officials say they will make races safer after a serious injury to four-time world champion Dario Franchitti.</description>

      <date>1381221427</date>
      <body>IndyCar officials are investigating to see how to make races safer after four-time world champion Dario Franchitti suffered a serious injury on Sunday.The Scot, 40, suffered two broken vertebrae in his spine and also broke his right ankle and cracked two ribs in a crash at the Houston Grand Prix.In 2011, English IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon died when he crashed in a race."Reducing the risks that are associated with racing is one of our highest priorities," an IndyCar statement read."IndyCar is thoroughly reviewing the incident. Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by the accident."Franchitti's car flipped into the air following a final-lap collision with Japanese driver Takuma Sato and hit the safety fence.The three-time Indianapolis 500 winner's car smashed into several pieces but did not catch fire, while an official and 13 spectators also suffered injuries after being hit by debris.Franchitti has had surgery on his right ankle at the Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center and will remain in Houston for a few days before being transported to Indianapolis for further evaluation.Wheldon was killed when he crashed at the Las Vegas Super Speedway in October 2011, but safety measures he had helped to introduce could have saved Franchitti's life.A reinforced chassis called DW12, which Wheldon helped design and is now named after the Englishman, remained intact during Franchitti's crash and it has been claimed  this prevented the driver from sustaining further injury.Earlier this year in an interview with roadandtrack.com,  Franchitti praised the new chassis and believed the cars felt safer.He said: "Inside the cockpit, instead of the seat being the only deformable structure, now we have the seat sitting in about two inches of special impact foam in all directions. I'm hoping this will translate into a safer car."Dan had so much to do with the initial chassis development, I think it's a nice tribute and another way of keeping him in people's thoughts."</body>

      <title>Partick Thistle 0-1 Hibernian</title>
      <description>Hibs move up to fifth in the Scottish Premiership with a narrow victory over Partick Thistle at a rain-soaked Firhill.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24349647</url>
      <date>1381184032</date>
      <body>Hibs moved up to fifth place in the Scottish Premiership thanks to a sixth goal of the season from Liam Craig.The midfielder arrowed a first-time shot into the top corner from 16 yards on 69 minutes at Firhill.Partick Thistle striker Kris Doolan headed narrowly over and wasted a one-on-one opportunity with a tame shot straight at Ben Williams.The Hibs keeper then kept out a close-range effort from Christie Elliot and tipped away a Ross Forbes shot.Craig's impressive finish was just Hibs' eighth goal in nine league outings, pushing the Edinburgh side level on 14 points with fourth-placed Aberdeen.The defeat means the Jags are still without a victory at home in the Premiership and have gone six games since their last win.Four minutes into the match the hosts earned an indirect free-kick on the visitors' six yard line after Williams collected a back-pass, but Sean Welsh's powerful drive was blocked by Michael Nelson.Moments later, Thistle keeper Scott Fox had to rely on some deft footwork to prevent Paul Heffernan latching onto a long ball.Stuart Bannigan fired a ball into the Hibs penalty area for Kallum Higginbotham to run onto, but Paul Hanlon made a surgically-precise tackle to clear the danger.Soon after, Higginbotham drilled in a 25-yard half-volley that Williams did well to contain.Hibs' best chance of the first period came from a Heffernan shot from the edge of the Thistle penalty area that drifted two yards wide of Fox's right-hand post.As the interval neared, Thistle full-back Stephen O'Donnell raced down the right and curved in a cross that Doolan leapt to meet, but his header flew just too high.Five minutes after the restart, Doolan was allowed to race onto O'Donnell's long ball, but the striker could not take advantage of a free run at goal as his shot was comfortably saved by Williams.Welsh had a penalty claim waved away by referee Kevin Clancy and Higginbotham should have done better with a shot that cut across the Hibs penalty area.However, it was the visitors who finally opened the scoring in the 69th minute when substitute Abdellah Zoubir cut the ball across the 18-yard line for Craig to blast high into the net.With 10 minutes remaining, a corner for Thistle drifted across the face of goal, but no Jags jerseys were on hand to profit.The home side kept pressing and Elliot's shot from six yards was stopped by the foot of Williams at full-stretch.The Hibs captain had to get back to his feet quickly and was alert enough to spring up to his left and push away a 20-yard strike from Forbes.The same player was over a free-kick in added-on time but delivered something of an anti-climax for the home fans, the ball sailing over the bar and with it any hope of salvaging a point.</body>

      <title>Looking into Scotland's black history</title>
      <description>Scotland's long and intriguing black history</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24347632</url>

      <body>October is Black History Month, an event first marked in the UK 25 years ago. Scotland has close associations with the black African and Caribbean communities it celebrates.Black History Month has been held annually in the US since the 1920s and in the UK from the late 80s.It is a celebration of the contribution that black African and Caribbean communities have made on a local level and across the world.Hackney, London, is where it all started in British terms and the London borough is holding various events to mark the 25th anniversary.Scotland's black history is populated by interesting and important characters, many of whom had to endure prejudice and racism. But who were some of these people?On the bottom of in Eddrachillis Bay near Drumbeg, in Sutherland, lie three cannon and part of a wooden hull of an age-old ship.Archaeologists believe it could be the remains of a Dutch vessel that got into difficulty off Scotland's remote north-west Highland coast between 1650 and 1750.One theory is that the vessel was owned by the Dutch East India Company, also known as VOC.Founded in 1602, it was the world's biggest and most powerful trading company until it collapsed in financial ruin in 1799.Its vessels regularly sailed around the north of Scotland because of the favourable winds and also to avoid the English Channel, particularly at times of war and tensions in Europe.The cannon could have been used by the Drumbeg ship's crew to ward off privateers, privately-owned armed vessels commissioned by a state to attack an enemy's shipping.And it has been suggested some or all of the crew may have survived their ordeal.There is possible evidence of foreign sailors setting up home in the north of Scotland after their vessel foundered off the Sutherland coast.The First Statistical Account of Scotland published between 1791 and 1799 records how the climate of the area was pleasant enough for "natives of the East and West Indies" to live there.Philip Robertson, a Historic Scotland marine archaeologist, told BBC Scotland in March that the origins of the Drumbeg crew, and their fate, was still unknown.But he added: "The wreck gives us a unique window into our history and, interestingly, the trading activity off the Scottish coastline and across the world."Scots were heavily involved in the slave trade of the 18th and 19th Centuries, something which leading historian Prof Tom Devine has accused Scotland of ignoring today.Men and women were put to work in Scots-run plantations in the colonies. Female slaves were also sexually abused by their owners.An exhibition on slavery held in 2011 involving the Centre for History in Dornoch and Edinburgh Beltane organisation featured correspondence detailing the keeping of sex slaves.The letters were sent by Highland owners to relatives in Inverness and their contents were described as "graphic" and "disturbing" by researchers.Scotland's slave past is also recorded in other sources.In 2007, historians were intrigued by a mysterious black figure who appears in a tapestry depicting the Battle of Culloden of 16 April 1746.Some at experts at the National Trust for Scotland had a theory that he may be a Jamaican servant of an officer on the government side.Little is known of the 18th Century needlework, and the trust said it was not clear if the tapestry was a true depiction of a scene from the battle, or one featuring later influences.Papers in the JLM Mitchell Archive of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, meanwhile, include a Scottish soldier's request to take his daughter Mary's black slave with him to war in 1782.Lt Soirle MacDonald, from Skye, was a British Army officer in the American War of Independence.His daughter's slave was called Doll. She was likely to have been made to do domestic duties.Records detailing compensation paid by the British government to slave owners after slavery was abolished mention Gen Sir James Duff, an army officer and MP for Banffshire.He was awarded £4,101, more than £3m in today's money, to compensate him for the 202 slaves he was forced by law to give up on the Grange Sugar Estate in Jamaica.David Alston, a local historian and Highland councillor, has also examined slavery.He was drawn to the subject after discovering that fossil hunter, geologist and writer Hugh Miller sat next to a black pupil in the school he attended in Cromarty.Dr Alston said: "I gradually noticed more and more local connections with the Caribbean, including references on gravestones."Slowly it became clear just how many Highland Scots had connections to slave-worked plantations and how many children were born to these Highlanders and either enslaved or 'free coloured' women."Further research led Dr Alston to find that almost every prominent school in the Highlands had black pupils on its roll at some time between 1790 and 1830.He said: "I keep my research very focussed on the three former Dutch colonies which later became British Guiana, now Guyana, on the north coast of South America."Almost everyone will recognise the name of one of the colonies - Demerara."I have now identified almost 450 people with Highland connections involved in the plantation of Guyana before emancipation of slaves in 1834."But Scots also fought against slavery.They served in the Union army in the American Civil War of 1861-65. Slavery was among issues that divided American society at the time, and led to a violent conflict.Lt Col William L Duff, Sgt Maj John McEwan, Robert Steedman, James Wilkie, Robert Ferguson and Alexander Smith are listed on a civil war memorial in Edinburgh.Other Scots who fought for the Union included Glasgow-born John McTammany, who served in the 115th Ohio volunteers.Another was George Henry Mackenzie, who was born 175 years ago in North Kessock, a small community across the Beauly Firth from Inverness.As a captain, he led Black Union soldiers.Football was where two key figures in Scotland's black history excelled in the face of extreme prejudice in the late 1800s.Carrie Boustead played in goals for a number of teams including Mrs Graham's XI, a women's team set up by Helen Matthew, the daughter of a Montrose-born master mariner.Richard McBrearty, of the Scottish Football Museum, said: "A degree of mystery surrounds Carrie Boustead."It is believed that Carrie Boustead was originally known as Clara Berry and was raised in Liverpool during the 1870s."Carrie first comes to prominence in 1896 when she played in a series of football matches north and south of the border."Boustead was in goals for a London team that played at Barrowfield Park in Glasgow in May 1896, and also in a game held in Stirling.She was listed as being goalkeeper for Mrs Graham's XI in a match played at Wishaw in Lanarkshire.Boustead is among women footballers of the 1800s portrayed in paintings by Scots artist Stuart Gibbs.Mr McBrearty said: "At a time when there was widespread cynicism towards women playing football, Boustead was a successful proponent of the women's game and she, along with her team mates of the period, should be remembered for their achievements north and south of the border as pioneers."While much of Boustead's life is a mystery, the career of Andrew Watson, Scotland's first black international footballer, is well documented.Mr Brearty said: "Watson was one of the greatest defenders of his generation."He played in three of the greatest and most high profile teams of the 1880s - Queen's Park FC, Corinthians, and Scotland."Watson, who was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, and whose father was a plantation manager and former slave owner from Orkney, played for Scotland at a time when they dominated international football.His three caps for Scotland were a 6-1 and 5-1 win over England and a 5-1 win over Wales.Mr Brearty said: "On his debut in 1881 he captained Scotland to a 6-1 win over England at the Oval in London - this remains England's heaviest defeat on home soil."He added: "Watson only won three caps because he moved away from Scotland and down to London in 1882 and was beyond the gaze of the international selectors."While in London in 1882 he played for the London Swifts in an FA Cup match and became the first known black footballer to play in the FA Cup."He is the first black international footballer and international football captain."England's Corinthians included a few non-English players. Watson was the first of those footballers and he played in the team's 8-1 win over reigning FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in 1884.But Watson's star qualities on the pitch did not protect him from racial abuse.Mr McBrearty said: "The Scottish Athletic Journal provided an overview of his career in 1885."It stated: 'Although on more than one occasion subjected to vulgar insults by splenetic, ill-tempered players, he uniformly preserved that gentlemanly demeanour which has endeared him to opponents as well as his club companions'."This suggests that he experienced racism on the field, but that he was able to rise above insults and let his sporting ability shine through on the park."But he added: "One of the best complements to Watson's ability can be found in his selection in an all-star Scotland team in 1926. JAH Catton, editor of the Athletic News, selected Watson at left back in his all-time Scotland team, 44 years after his last Scotland appearance."Eugene Bullard - America's first black combat pilot - must rate among one of the most unusual characters from Scotland's black history.Georgia-born Bullard's ancestors included slaves from Martinique who were brought to America by their French owners as they fled the Haitian slave revolution.His father spoke French and also talked fondly of France, instilling in Bullard a belief that it was the true land of opportunity, free of prejudice.Spurred by an attempt to lynch his father and his own brushes with racial hatred, Bullard worked towards getting himself to Paris. This journey first took him to Scotland.According to Craig Lloyd's book Eugene Bullard: Black Expatriate in Jazz-Age Paris, Bullard was barely in his teens when he stowed away on a German cargo ship at Norfolk, Virginia.The captain of the Marta Russ first threatened to throw Bullard overboard, before giving him the chance of working on the ship on its passage to Aberdeen.Bullard left his ship shortly after it reached Aberdeen. He spent a day in the Granite City before taking a train to Glasgow.While he was relieved to find he was not the target of vicious racial abuse in Scotland, Lloyd said that Bullard did have one immediate problem.Lloyd wrote: "At first he had difficulty with the Scottish dialect and accent: 'the language the natives spoke was sort of like English'."Bullard spent five months in Glasgow and earned money acting as a lookout at illegal gambling dens.He later headed for Liverpool and then finally France.In World War I, he served with the French Foreign Legion and saw action at some of the bloodiest battles, including the Somme and Artois Ridge.Wounds he suffered at Verdun ruled him out from returning to the front line as a soldier, but he was offered a chance to become a pilot with the French Flying Corps.In 1917, he qualified as a flyer. He earned one officially confirmed kill.When the US entered the war, Bullard sought a transfer to its air force. His request was ignored.Bullard remained in Paris after the war.He became part-owner of a night club, got married and had three children.During World War II, he fought with the French resistance until he was badly wounded and was smuggled into Spain.Thirty-three years after his death in 1961 the US Air Force posthumously commissioned him as a lieutenant in honour of his war-time exploits.</body>

      <title>One city's house price surge</title>
      <description>The city where property prices have doubled in a decade</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24348196</url>
      <date>1381100429</date>
      <body>Two cities in the UK - one is a centre of commerce, has runaway house prices, and welcomes a constant stream of overseas property buyers. The other is London.House prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the Nationwide Building Society.That increase is only matched by the trendy north London borough of Islington, and by Westminster in the heart of the capital of the UK.Recent figures show that Scotland's third city is recording a fresh surge in property prices. One estate agent describes the area as a property force field."Everywhere outside is doom and gloom, but it is boom time here," says Brian Sutton, of James and George Collie solicitors and estate agents.Take a closer look at Aberdeen, and its picturesque, shimmering granite homes, and you can see the complexity of the UK property market.The city has demand from first-time buyers willing to pay above valuation levels, interest from workers moving to the area, investors keen to get in on the act, and a lack of homes for sale.All this pushes up prices. Yet, in Scotland as a whole, prices are only creeping up after years of stagnation.It shows that averages can be misleading and that local areas can have very different trends to neighbouring regions, for reasons ranging from the quality of local schools to employment levels.It also questions a widely held belief that the London property market is unique - that soaring prices in the south-east of England are unequalled in the rest of the country.At the mouth of Aberdeen Harbour, next to the fishermen's village of Footdee, is a landmark called the Roundhouse.The Shoremaster's accounts for 1797-98 show that more than £225 was spent on the new house and telescope on the site.Nowadays, first-time buyers in the city can expect to pay up to £140,000 for a one-bedroom flat, or up to £500,000 for a bigger property.Competition for homes means many buyers are paying 5% to 10% over valuation at the moment, says Bill Barclay, partner at Raeburns solicitors and estate agents.Often sales go to sealed bids, with first-timers stretching their savings to compete with buy-to-let investors.Spend a few minutes standing by the harbour and the reason for this active property market is clear - North Sea oil."It drives the local economy," says Mr Barclay. "Big companies are making long-term financial plans for the area, so we are not going to see much changing."The area was not immune to the financial crisis. Banks were not lending at the levels they had been before 2008, but Mr Barclay says Glasgow and Edinburgh suffered much more.Now, he says - using a phrase apt for an oil-producing region - the banks are "starting to open the taps" again to fund mortgages.Figures published by the University of Aberdeen show a 25% increase in the volume of sales in the second quarter of the year compared with the same three months in 2011. Prices were up by 5.5% in the city and its suburbs over the same period.Sales volumes of flats were up by 53% in that time, as buy-to-let investors find the finance and predict demand from tenants.All this is gloomy news for potential first-time buyers. One 32-year-old tells the BBC he has been renting on the south coast of England and then Aberdeen over the past 15 years and is unable to save anything close to what is needed as a deposit.You hardly see a sale sign erected within the city's sought-after areas, with supply low and competition picking up. But the market is far from overheating, as it was in 2007, according to estate agent Brian Sutton."We had people in their early 20s buying property, with 10 to 20 bidding for one property. Competition has come back, but it is three to four people bidding," he says."First-time buyers are in their early 30s, not their 20s, often with their parents helping."He predicts the housing market will continue to rise at a "sustainable rate", especially as the oil companies build headquarters in the area and continue to relocate staff to the region.Prices may grow by single figures year-on-year, he says, but nobody wants to return to the days of 20% a year increases.Much the same point was made by Business Secretary Vince Cable when he raised concerns about a property bubble potentially being inflated by government schemes to kick-start the market."In London and the south east, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures," he said.Despite his warning, the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has been brought forward by three months in England, and the Scottish government has announced the start of its own scheme.The UK and Scottish governments both argue that Help to Buy, which includes allowing buyers to apply for a shared equity loan for part of the property, are vital to give people the chance to secure a mortgage from risk-averse lenders.Buyers only qualify under the Scottish scheme if they are buying a newly built property.Critics might argue that they should encourage the developers to follow the example of the fishermen's cottages at Footdee - where the front doors face inwards to protect occupants from incoming storms.</body>

      <title>EU exit would be suicide, says Clegg</title>
      <description>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union and supporters must "speak up", Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <body>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union, Nick Clegg has warned.The deputy PM said a new "coalition in the national interest" was needed to make the case for membership, and asked businesses and charities to help.He attacked David Cameron's proposed referendum, calling it a "short-sighted political calculation" which could see the UK "stumble out" of the EU.Eurosceptic group Business for Britain accused Mr Clegg of "scaremongering".In a speech at the London headquarters of Swiss technology firm Buhler Group, Mr Clegg said EU withdrawal would leave Britain "isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard" and not "taken seriously" by world superpowers.He has written to 100 businesses, charities and trade groups urging them to speak out about the benefits the EU brings."My great fear, in all of this, is that pro-Europeans are being too slow to wake up to the danger ahead," the Liberal Democrat leader said."The day I dread - the day I hope never comes - is a time when it is all too late: Britain has stumbled out of the EU, and we look back to these days and say we should have done more."It will not be enough to speak up on the eve of a referendum. We need to start challenging some of the ludicrous myth-making by the isolationists now."Mr Clegg said he accepted a referendum was inevitable but believed it should be held after the change to EU rules.Mr Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election.But Mr Clegg said that was designed to "plaster over" internal Tory divisions over Europe until after the 2015 general election.Mr Clegg said: "Next May the Euro elections are bound to become a proxy for the bigger questions of 'in versus out' - a debate that will play out in the 2015 general election, too."He argued that "you cannot overstate the damage" that leaving the EU would do and predict that having to negotiate individual trade treaties would take a decade."We simply will not be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers, if we're isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard," he said.On Sunday Conservative backbench MP Adam Afriyie said he would try to force the government to hold the referendum in 2014, and Mr Clegg said it was "not even clear" Mr Cameron would be able to delay the vote until 2017.He also questioned whether any reform of Britain's relationship with the EU would "ever be acceptable to the large swathes in the Conservative Party who want to be semi-detached from the EU or out of it altogether".Demonstrating another divide with his party's coalition partners, he called the European Convention on Human Rights a "huge success for European co-operation".Home Secretary Theresa May, who has clashed with Strasbourg judges over various cases including the process of deporting extremist preacher Abu Qatada, has indicated the UK could leave the convention.Business for Britain said Mr Clegg's comments risked undermining the prime minister's attempt to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.</body>

      <title>Press plan for regulation 'rejected'</title>
      <description>Senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have rejected the press's own favoured version of a royal charter for press regulation, the BBC's Newsnight has learned.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24439588</url>
      <date>1381217527</date>
      <body>Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.A source said a sub-committee of the Privy Council, containing Lib Dem and Tory cabinet ministers, thought the proposals were "flawed".But sub-committee chair Danny Alexander insisted no decision had been made.The full Privy Council is also looking at an alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners.It is due to announce its decision on the press proposals on Wednesday and the alternative plan on 30 October.Press regulation options are being considered in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, which was set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Politicians and the press have been at odds over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the regulator.The government's proposals published in March have cross-party backing and the support of campaign group Hacked Off.There are a series of key differences between the industry's plan for press regulation and that agreed by politicians and campaigners.Newsnight's political editor Allegra Stratton was told Privy Council members felt proposals for self-regulation put forward by newspapers did not meet the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report.Mr Alexander, who told the BBC the sub-committee met on Monday and the full Privy Council will meet on Wednesday to consider the press proposal, said there were a "few remaining" details to be decided - but insisted "no final decision has been made".But ministers "do look set to reject" the form of regulation put forward by newspapers, BBC political editor Nick Robinson said.The Privy Council sub-committee sub-committee consists of four Tories and two Lib Dems - and both parties have been critical of the press proposals - he added.Steve Hewlett, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, told Newsnight that newspaper publishers felt the process had been far from transparent.He said: "People I have spoken to are furious and are now considering whether there might be a legal challenge to this decision by the Privy Council."The newspapers' proposals would:Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of the Sun, said the news was not a shock."It's what we'd been given fairly clear clues would happen," he said."I think it has to be seen as a great victory for the forces of oppression of a free press - Hacked Off in particular - and the politicians who have gone along for the ride."Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said the press's plan had been a "delaying manoeuvre" by the big national newspapers."The problem with the papers is that they do not want to deal fairly with complaints," he said.Mr Cathcart said there was a "rare unanimity" in Parliament on this issue, and the press was refusing to compromise "like an errant child on the naughty step with his fingers in his ears".He said only the press stood against the consensus in politics and the public which said: "We want Parliament's royal charter - Leveson's royal charter - and we want it now."Earlier, Gerry McCann said the newspaper industry's plans for press regulation were "a gentlemen's club agreement" and should be rejected by politicians.The father of missing Madeleine McCann said the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry were the "minimum acceptable".Mr McCann and his family were subject to intense press attention after Madeleine went missing while they were on holiday in Portugal in 2007.</body>

      <body>The Lib Dems have defended Norman Baker's appointment as a Home Office minister, saying his views on the death of government scientist David Kelly in 2003 are irrelevant to the job.As a backbench MP, Mr Baker claimed Mr Kelly was murdered and this may have be en hushed up by the UK authorities.Home Secretary Theresa May is reported to be unhappy with his appointment.But Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said Mr Baker had been an "enormously effective" minister since 2010.Mr Baker's promotion from the Department of Transport, where he had been a minister for the past three years, to the Home Office, was a surprise feature of Monday's government reshuffle.He has replaced Jeremy Browne, previously regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies.In his new role as minister of state for crime prevention, Mr Baker will be responsible for policy on drugs, organised and violent crime and anti-social behaviour.In a 2006 book titled 'The Strange Death of David Kelly', Mr Baker claimed Dr Kelly had been killed by Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein and his murder may have been passed off as suicide by the British security services for "reasons of political expediency".The government weapons expert was found dead in an Oxfordshire wood after he was named as the source of claims about Iraq's weapons capability which triggered a furious row between the then Labour government and the BBC.Mr Baker spent six months investigating the circumstances of Dr Kelly's death, stepping down from his frontbench role at the time. He has maintained his calls for a fresh public inquiry.The 2004 Hutton Inquiry concluded that Dr Kelly committed suicide.A formal inquest has never been held but Attorney General Dominic Grieve has rejected calls for the case to be reopened, saying the evidence about the causes of death was "overwhelming".Mr Alexander, one of the most senior Lib Dems in government, said his colleague's views on the death of Dr Kelly were "well explained" and he personally did not agree with them.But he added: "It is an excellent appointment. As we enter the last third of this government, there are a whole range of areas that we, as Liberal Democrats, need to sharpen our campaigning edge."Home Office issues is one of those things... Norman has been an enormously effective minister in the Department for Transport, he has done a great job for the government and the Lib Dems and he deserves this opportunity."Mr Alexander told Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Baker had had access to "all sorts of information" at the Department of Transport and proved himself to be reliable."He will be a great Home Office minister, with a great track record on civil liberties issues and standing up for the rights of people in this country and that is precisely what the Lib Dems need in the Home Office," he added.One Lib Dem activist said Mr Baker's appointment was specifically designed to "annoy" the home secretary.The Lib Dem Voice website - which is read by party activists - quoted a source close to the party leadership as suggesting Mr Browne had failed to leave a "liberal imprint" during his time at the Home Office.Stephen Tall, the website's co-editor, said Mr Baker's appointment could also be explained by the party's "sluggish" response to the "Go Home Vans row" where billboards were driven around parts of the UK warning illegal immigrants to either leave the country voluntarily or face arrest.The Lib Dems claimed they were not consulted about the policy, with Mr Browne saying he was away at the time."It's not that Nick Clegg expects Norman Baker to get more of an inside track on the Home Office than Jeremy Browne did, and be able to prevent Theresa May's authoritarian knee-jerk," Mr Tall added."But he can rely on him to project a liberal message when the leader's away."It's hard to see Norman's (appointment) as anything but a calculated move to seriously annoy the Home Office, and put clear yellow water between us and the Tories."</body>

      <title>Help to Buy costs being unveiled</title>
      <description>Banks begin to unveil details of the mortgages they will offer under the government's expanded Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <date>1381220487</date>
      <body>Banks have begun to unveil mortgages which they will offer under the expanded Help to Buy scheme.The government's initiative is designed to enable buyers who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC and Virgin Money joining later.There have been concerns the scheme could fuel a housing price bubble, but Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander told the BBC that there is no UK price boom."People who think that there's a housing bubble should get out more. They should get out of Kensington and Chelsea, and go to Manchester or Birmingham, and major towns across the country," he said.He said the scheme would help those people to who do not have "piles of cash" for a mortgage deposit.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.HSBC said it would join the scheme later in the year, and Virgin Money said it would offer Help to Buy mortgages from January.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is expected to be up to 0.9% of a property's sale price. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Those who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the Conservative Party conference that the second phase of the scheme would be brought forward by three months from January.A number of lenders have expressed an interest in joining the second phase. Lloyds Banking Group and RBS are the most prominent. Other lenders have yet to commit.Some products from the Halifax and Bank of Scotland will be available from Friday, with deals from other lenders expected to be in place by January.Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September.The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Mr Alexander said the Treasury Committee was right to say that Ministers should keep a close watch on Help to Buy. "We will make adjustments if they (the FPC) recommend them," he said.He also rejected criticism that the government should be tackling a house supply shortage, rather than demand. "All the housebuilders tell us is that what is holding them back (building more houses) is a lack of demand," he said. "There are lots of other policies that this government is doing to tackle demand."Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.</body>

      <title>Post-Yes defence plan 'would cost'</title>
      <description>The UK government believes establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.</description>

      <body>The UK government believes that establishing a Scottish military in the event of independence would put a substantial burden on public finances.The claim will appear in the latest Coalition analysis paper prepared by UK civil servants.The Scottish government proposes a £2.5bn defence force if there is a "yes" vote next September.A spokesman said an independent Scotland would have first-class conventional forces.Meanwhile the BBC has seen an internal Ministry of Defence (MoD) briefing document on Scottish independence.It raised concerns about the effect a "yes" vote would have on England, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying the debate matters because of the potential effect of Scottish independence on "our politics, our economy, our standing" - referring to the rest of UK.The document also suggested that about 500,000 votes could "swing the result" of the referendum "either way".Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will promote the UK's current defence set-up during a speech in Edinburgh later.The 86-page analysis paper is being published after MPs on the Commons Defence Committee said it would be "remiss" of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) not to consider the implications of independence, including the future of Trident at the Faslane base.The document will focus on funding, jobs and the problems involved in splitting up an integrated military.The report concludes that the transition to an independent force would be complex.One extract from the analysis says: "Adapting the functions of Scotland's defence footprint would result in a substantial burden on the public finances of an independent Scottish state during establishment, and duplication of costs thereafter for the essential services currently provided on a UK-wide basis."It is difficult to predict how long the establishment phase would last, but given the complex, integrated nature of the UK armed forces and the absence of command and control structures and other essential components in Scotland, this would not be an easy process."Even basic re-design of military bases is a costly undertaking requiring substantial investment to cater for different operational needs."It added that negotiations over assets and liabilities such as equipment, basing and other infrastructure "would be difficult".The report also said that the issue of personnel would present an "extremely difficult challenge to overcome".However, the MoD said picking the UK military apart "would not be impossible".A Scottish government spokesman said he welcomed the "important acknowledgement" from the UK government that an independent Scotland would stand to "inherit a fair share of current UK defence assets".He added: "An independent Scotland will have first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and co-operating with international partners - but we will not waste billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons."We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane, which will be Scotland's main conventional naval facility, and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases."</body>

      <title>Moore sacked in government reshuffle</title>
      <description>Alistair Carmichael replaces Michael Moore as Scottish Secretary as other ministerial changes are announced and Labour carries out its own reshuffle.</description>

      <date>1381181108</date>
      <body>Michael Moore has been replaced by Alistair Carmichael as secretary of state for Scotland in a wide-ranging reshuffle of Conservative and Lib Dem ministers in the coalition government.Mr Moore said he was "disappointed" but would continue to back the UK ahead of next year's independence referendum.Ex-journalist Esther McVey is among several female Tory MPs to be promoted as David Cameron freshened up his team.Ed Miliband has also carried out a major shake-up of Labour's frontbench.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg has been replaced by historian Tristram Hunt while Jim Murphy, another senior figure regarded as being on the right of the party, is moved from defence to international development.But Andy Burnham is to stay as shadow health secretary.Mr Moore was the only cabinet minister to lose his job in Monday's coalition reshuffle, which has largely focused on middle-ranking and junior ministerial positions.In other notable government changes:Reacting to his sacking, Mr Moore said the future of the UK was "bigger than one individual or party" and he believed those wanting Scotland to remain as part of the union were "winning the argument".Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition.He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman.The BBC's chief political correspondent, Norman Smith, said the move could be explained by David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's desire to have a more combative figure in the job to take the fight to SNP leader Alex Salmond.Announcing the change, Mr Clegg said Mr Moore had done a "formidable" job but that he believed "we now need to draw on different experience in the final year running up to the referendum itself".News on the ministerial reshuffle was broken via the No 10 Twitter site.Five women MPs have joined the government while three have been promoted.Former broadcaster Esther McVey has been elevated from her role as junior disabilities minister in the Department of Work and Pensions to minister of state, with responsibility for employment.Nicky Morgan, previously a government whip, joins the Treasury as economic secretary while Justice minister Helen Grant moves to the Department for Culture, taking on responsibility for sport and tourism as well as equalities.Anna Soubry moves from health to defence while Jane Ellison takes her role as public health minister. Claire Perry and Amber Rudd have joined the government as whips while current whip Karen Bradley is promoted.Also on the rise is Matt Hancock, a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, who stays within the Department for Business but with a wider brief encompassing skills and enterprise.And fresh faces in the government include George Eustice, David Cameron's former press secretary, at environment, Shailesh Vera at justice and Kris Hopkins at local government.Among those being axed include Housing minister Mark Prisk, Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon and Treasury Minister Mark Hoban, who tweeted that it was not his "finest day".Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said the government's reshuffle was "designed to support hardworking people" and he accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of "purging moderates" in his party.Lib Dem Jeremy Browne, previously regarded as a close ally of Nick Clegg, was a surprising casualty after he was replaced at the Home Office by Norman Baker.Writing to Mr Browne, Mr Clegg said: "It is always very difficult to move colleagues out of government but as you know, I have always been keen that we provide the opportunity for as many in our ranks as possible to contribute their skills to ministerial office during this Parliament."Lib Dem peer Baroness Kramer, who lost her seat at the 2010 election, becomes a transport minister while Stephen Williams and Dan Rogerson get junior ministerial jobs at local government and environment respectively.A number of Conservative ministers resigned from the government over the weekend in anticipation of the reshuffle, with Mr Cameron looking to reshape his lower and middle ranks.</body>

      <title>MPs question economic case for HS2</title>
      <description>A committee of MPs concludes there are serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link will offer value for money.</description>

      <date>1381188013</date>
      <body>A committee of MPs has voiced serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link would offer the UK value for money.Members of the Treasury Committee said there were "serious shortcomings" in the current cost-benefit analysis for HS2.They said the economic case must be looked at again.A government spokesman said HS2 was vital for the UK to meet its "urgent capacity needs".HS2, which stands for High Speed Two, is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033.The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock.The Committee's report called for a more convincing case for HS2 from the Treasury."We need reassurance that it can deliver the benefits intended and that those benefits are greater than those of other transport schemes - whether in the department's project pipeline or not - which may be foregone," it said.The MPs said the government should formally reassess the project and proceed only once three criteria are met:The government spokesman said the project was on course, under control and would be delivered within the agreed budget."We are confident that our analysis is robust and conforms with government spending guidance," he said."The case for HS2 will be further improved when we publish shortly the updated strategic case - including cost-benefit analysis - which will show high value for money for the project."The HS2 plans have had the backing of all three main political leaders but are strongly opposed by some backbench MPs.However, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has hinted Labour might ditch the project over its cost if the party regains power.A recent report for HS2 Ltd found the project could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service.But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it said.</body>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The three new members of the shadow cabinet, Rachel Reeves, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <title>Cable defends Royal Mail pricing</title>
      <description>Business Scretary Vince Cable says Labour's Chuka Umunna is wrong to say the Royal Mail is being sold off too cheaply.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24437969</url>
      <date>1381177036</date>
      <body>Labour's Chuka Umunna is wrong to say Royal Mail is being sold too cheaply, Business Secretary Vince Cable says.In a letter to the shadow business secretary, Mr Cable says the price was set after "extensive consultation" with investors.His letter follows criticism that the sale price undervalues the business by up to £1bn.Mr Cable warns the criticism is "irresponsible" as it may imply an "easy bargain" is to be had.Earlier on Monday Mr Umunna told the BBC City investors and hedge funds would be the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering and that the sale was "short changing" taxpayers.He said stockbroker Panmure Gordon, which valued the business at £4.5bn, well above the government's top end price band of £3.3bn, was only one voice.In his letter, Mr Cable dismisses in detail many of Mr Umunna's criticisms and says that the price reflects the fact the business brings risks, as well as assets such as property.He says: "It is irresponsible to imply that a share offering looks significantly undervalued."I think you should consider the risk that you may be influencing the decisions of retail investors. Equity investment always involves risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there is an easy bargain to be made."Demand for the shares has been strong.On Friday, it was reported it was outstripping supply and they were to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested price range.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares were a "few times" the value of those on offer.Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the brokers through which investors can buy shares, said it would stay open until midnight on Tuesday to cope with the expected high demand.Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.Up to 62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds."The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares is very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold at between 300-330p.Members of the Communication Workers Union are being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.John Glen, senior lecturer in economics at the Cranfield School of Management suggested demand was being driven by a government guarantee of a £130m profit to shareholders next July, meaning shareholders would get a 6.5% return on their shares,."(It) is a good return given what you get if you put your money in the bank at the moment," he told BBC Breakfast.However, he noted that the privatisation was controversial. "Over the last six years, we the taxpayers have spent about £2.75bn making the Royal Mail more profitable, we've taken on £8bn of pension liabilities and of course there's the issue about whether or not the Royal Mail will guarantee to deliver to us every day, across the whole country, at a single price."</body>

      <title>Hunt denies Burnham cover-up claim</title>
      <description>Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insists he did not imply that his Labour shadow, Andy Burnham, had personally covered up evidence of poor care.</description>

      <date>1381174438</date>
      <body>Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has insisted he did not intend to imply that his Labour shadow Andy Burnham had personally covered up evidence of poor care at an NHS Trust.A tweet from Mr Hunt appeared to accuse Mr Burnham of attempting a cover-up while he was in office, prompting a response from Labour's lawyers.Mr Hunt told Mr Burnham: "Whatever our differences on health policy, I do not doubt your personal integrity."Labour accused him of "backtracking".In a letter to the shadow health secretary, Mr Hunt said he believed there was "political pressure" on England's health watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as it investigated failings at NHS hospitals."As health secretary, you presided over a culture where 'bad' news surfacing about care problems was discouraged for political or other reasons and CQC staff felt they would be castigated by your department if such news did emerge," he wrote.But the tweet was "not a suggestion that you personally covered up evidence of poor care", he argued.A spokesman for Andy Burnham said: "The secretary of state is clearly backtracking. His reply is an apology of sorts, but he seeks to re-write the tweet rather than delete it. We are considering his response in consultation with our lawyers."On Saturday, Labour's lawyers wrote to Mr Hunt seeking a retraction of the tweet and a public apology unless he could provide evidence to substantiate his allegation.Mr Burnham did not rule out the possibility of suing Mr Hunt for defamation.Mr Hunt's tweet is believed to have related to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary in the previous Labour government.</body>

      <title>Flying care visits 'disgraceful'</title>
      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24424785</url>
      <date>1381150872</date>
      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care, Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".The government said the Care Bill would prevent "inappropriate" short visits but would not outlaw 15-minute visits.Leonard Cheshire wants a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to prevent the practice in England.Care minister Norman Lamb said the government "can't ban these short visits completely" because they are useful in some circumstances, such as when a carer visits to give someone medicine.But he told the BBC a 15-minute visit was "completely inappropriate" when people needed things like feeding or bathing."We're actually introducing an amendment to the Care Bill this week which will require councils to focus on an individual's wellbeing when they're organising care on their behalf, and so this sort of very short visit for personal care would not meet that standard," he said.He also said the government plans to "force" the NHS and local government to work better together and end the "ridiculous split" between health and social care.A report published by Leonard Cheshire said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.The charity's latest research looks at England alone, but in August Unison accused many councils in Scotland of providing "care on the cheap" by arranging 15-minute home visits, and in June the union said 83% of Welsh councils were doing the same.Research by the UK Homecare Association published last year suggested 87% of home visits in Northern Ireland lasted 30 minutes or less, the highest proportion in the UK (73% in England and 42% in both Scotland and Wales).Separate care bills are currently going through the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added.Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Rosaleen, a Thames Valley care worker who gave only her first name, said 15-minute visits usually overrun.But she said the short time available still forced carers to make choices such as whether to leave someone alone with a hot drink which they might spill on themselves, or sit with them while they drink but fail to get them ready for bed.Asked if people's safety was being compromised by visits being too short, she replied: "Their safety, their independence, their dignity."Another care worker told the BBC that travel time was not included in her pay, so she would work unpaid time every day travelling between appointments.Sally Lubanov, 83, who is house-bound, said even in 30-minute visits "nothing got done" because carers would take some time booking in, checking what the previous visitor had done and preparing for whatever tasks needed doing.She said 15-minute visits might be fine for giving someone medicine, but for people living alone it was "wonderful to see someone" and short visits allowed no time for conversation.The Local Government Association (LGA), said social care was "substantially underfunded" and councils were under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Two Tories quit government posts</title>
      <description>Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith resign from the government as David Cameron reshapes his ministerial team.</description>

      <body>Two Conservative members of the government have quit amid speculation of an imminent ministerial reshuffle.Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith stepped down late on Sunday.Mr Randall, 58, has been Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 1997, while Chloe Smith has represented Norwich North since 2009.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said a government reshuffle could take place as soon as Monday.He said it was likely to focus on "mid-ranking ministers below cabinet level".As Deputy Chief Whip, Mr Randall was partly responsible for ensuring party discipline among fellow Tory MPs.He offered to quit at the end of last year, his resignation letter said.Ms Smith, 31, served in the Treasury before being moved to the Cabinet Office last September.Stepping down, she wrote to the prime minister pointing out she had been "only 27" when she became an MP and said she now wanted to "develop other ways of giving public service".She was thrust into the limelight last summer when she appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight to defend the government's fuel duty policy.The widely viewed interview with Jeremy Paxman prompted one Tory MP to label Chancellor George Osborne a "coward" for putting her forward in his place.Mr Randall had worked in the whips' office, either in government or opposition, for 13 years.In his resignation letter he paid tribute to David Cameron and said it had been "a great privilege and honour" to serve the party.The departures come after Transport Minister Simon Burns quit his post on Friday to launch a bid to become a deputy Speaker.Our political editor said: "The prime minister is known to be keen to promote women and those representing northern constituencies ahead of the general election and a wider Cabinet reshuffle which may take place next spring."BBC political correspondent Vicky Young says the Tories have a lot of talented women in junior roles who could be candidates for promotion.It is thought that Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will also make changes to the Liberal Democrat ministerial line-up and Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to reshuffle his shadow ministerial team.</body>

      <title>Litvinenko widow case to continue</title>
      <description>The widow of poisoned former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko is to continue her legal bid to force a public inquiry.</description>

      <body>The widow of poisoned former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko is to continue her legal bid to force a public inquiry.Marina Litvinenko said she came to the decision after the public responded to her appeal to help fund her costs.She wants the High Court to rule the home secretary was wrong not to order a public inquiry into her husband's death in London in 2006.Her lawyers say the decision to pursue the judicial review claim is "courageous".The UK government has ruled out an inquiry despite a coroner's decision that an inquest could not hear evidence of alleged Russian state involvement.Last week Mrs Litvinenko went to the High Court to seek permission to challenge the legality of the decision.But when the judges refused an order restricting her liability for costs if she loses the case, Mrs Litvinenko told the court she needed time to decided whether to continue.She then made her appeal to the public to help fund her fight.Mrs Litvinenko said it was the "overwhelming support from the people which convinced me not to abandon my cause".She said enough contributions had been received over the weekend to pay £2,500 of government costs presented to her for last week's proceedings."I decided not to quit even though I am threatened to pay tens of thousands of pounds of the government's legal expenses, should I lose my case," she said."My opponents do not want this investigation. But I will not be stopped."Mr Litvinenko, 43, died after he was poisoned with radioactive polonium while drinking tea with two Russian men, one a former KGB officer, at a London hotel.His family believe he was working for MI6 at the time of his death and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin.Home Secretary Theresa May has said that UK-Russian relations were a "factor" in the government's decision because an inquest was more "readily explainable" to foreign governments than an inquiry established by ministers.But she maintained that Mr Litvinenko's family "would learn no more from an inquiry than they would from the inquest" and an independent review into the case could still be held later if questions remained.</body>

      <title>The land of hope is Tory - Cameron</title>
      <description>David Cameron says the Tories are the party of "the many, not the few" in a conference speech also trailing possible benefit cuts for young people.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24358392</url>
      <date>1380729792</date>
      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24213366</url>
      <date>1380040625</date>
      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24163335</url>
      <date>1379689172</date>
      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Moore sacked in Lib Dem reshuffle</title>
      <description>Scottish Secretary Michael Moore is sacked in a Lib Dem reshuffle and will be replaced by fellow Scot Alistair Carmichael.</description>

      <body>Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has been sacked in a reshuffle of the Liberal Democrats' senior team at Westminster.He is being replaced by the Lib Dems' current chief whip, Alistair Carmichael.The move comes less than a year before the people of Scotland vote in a referendum on independence.Mr Moore is thought to be the only cabinet minister on the Lib Dem side of the coalition to lose his job.The party's UK leader Nick Clegg said that someone with a "different experience" was needed in the final year running up to the referendum itself.BBC Scotland's political editor Brian Taylor blogged that Mr Carmichael has a "secure reputation as a combative Lib Dem chief whip" plus a "dry wit and a cool head".The MP for Orkney and Shetland was appointed a whip following the coalition agreement in 2010.In September last year he took over from Jo Swinson as deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.BBC Scotland's Westminster correspondent Tim Reid reported that Mr Moore believed he had done his job "pretty effectively" and that he was "very disappointed" by the move.Mr Moore tweeted that it had been a great privilege to serve as Scottish secretary and he wished Mr Carmichael "all the best".After the news broke, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her "best wishes" to Mr Moore.She added: "A tough opponent but always pleasant. He can take pride in the achievement of the Edinburgh Agreement."Mr Moore is constituency MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk and has served at Westminster since 1997.He played a key role in the negotiations which led to the Edinburgh Agreement in October last year.The deal set out terms for a Scottish independence referendum and was signed by Prime Minister David Cameron and First Minister Alex Salmond in Scotland's capital.Liberal Democrat party leader Nick Clegg has thanked Mr Moore for his work in the post, which he was given three years ago.In a letter to the MP, Mr Clegg said: "Not only have you successfully piloted through legislation to enable Scotland to take a major step towards the party's long held goal of Home Rule, but you have also ensured that the referendum next year will give the Scottish people a clear and decisive question on which to cast their vote."It should be recognised that you secured both the Scotland Act and the Edinburgh Agreement in the context of a majority SNP government at Holyrood, and against a backdrop of an external political narrative that often suggested the legislation would fail and a referendum agreement could not be secured."He added: "I believe we now need to draw on different experience in the final year running up to the referendum itself and I am keen that just as we have benefited from your formidable skills over the past three years that we take advantage of other experience within our ranks during this period."Mr Moore responded by saying it was a "hugely important" time for Scottish politics.In a letter to Mr Clegg, he said that taking the Scotland Act through parliament and negotiating the Edinburgh Agreement had been highlights of his time in office.He added: "Over the last few years I have worked with a superb team of civil servants and advisers in the Scotland Office, and other government departments, in very challenging circumstances."I do not think the support teams for ministers always get the credit they deserve: I am very grateful for the support they have given me."In leaving the Scotland Office I am pleased that Alistair will be succeeding me. As a good friend and long time colleague, I believe he will do a superb job. I wish him all the best."Following Mr Carmichael's appointment, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran, said: "I welcome Alistair Carmichael to his new post and pay tribute to Michael Moore. We frequently disagreed, but he has made a significant contribution to the referendum debate and Scottish politics over the past two years."Meanwhile, in other reshuffle news concerning Scots MPs, Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from that post to the international development brief.The announcement was made by Labour Party leader Ed Miliband who, along with the Lib Dems and the Tories, have begun reshuffling their top team.</body>

      <body>Public services are braced for spending cuts as the Welsh government publishes its budget on Tuesday.Local councils have already been warned they will be exposed to more cuts than in previous years.A Welsh government source said ministers were preparing to deliver "the toughest budget since devolution".However, BBC Wales understands a budget deal with the opposition could be announced as early as Tuesday.Without an overall majority in the assembly, Labour will need an agreement from the opposition to approve its spending plans, worth about £15bn.John Rae, director of resources with the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We estimate we are facing cuts of around 4% after the local government minister warned us we'd be looking at English-style reductions."Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said there had been "a level of protection" to local government in Wales, and a study had shown that until now councils in Wales probably had taken "half the cut that councils in England had faced".He added that all the councils in Wales had their own priorities, but services in "discretionary areas" such as leisure, culture, planning, libraries, highways, street lights and economic development would be affected.The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for not protecting the health budget against inflation.Spending on the NHS has been frozen in recent years - meaning it has been cut in real terms after taking account of inflation.A review of the health budget was carried out over the summer.Speaking ahead of the draft budget, shadow finance minister Paul Davies AM criticised the situation in the NHS in Wales where "patients are routinely waiting over four hours to be seen in AandE".He added: "For the sake of our NHS, Carwyn Jones must use this draft budget to reverse Labour's damaging health cuts."In the last two years, Labour has done separate budget deals with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.This year, Plaid and the Lib Dems have joined forces to negotiate a deal with the government.An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said the UK government's block grant to Wales in 2013/14 would be around 9.4% smaller in real terms than it was in 2010/11.More cuts announced for the two years after that would take the reduction to 12.2%.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>
      <date>1358939858</date>
      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <date>1381218595</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing".

A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons.Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before.

Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999.

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24438875</url>
      <date>1381180644</date>
      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>Viewpoints: How should long-term unemployment be tackled?</title>
      <description>How should long-term unemployment be tackled?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24330111</url>
      <date>1380552793</date>
      <body>The long-term unemployed may have to undertake work placements in return for their benefits, under changes being unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne.From April 2014, people who are jobless after being on the work programme for two years will face three options - a community work placement; taking part in training; or visiting a job centre every day - or face losing benefits.Although the UK unemployment rate has fallen in recent months, the number of long-term unemployed has not fallen.How should long-term unemployment be tackled?Most would agree that people with the misfortune to be long-term unemployed need intensive, personalised help to get back into a job.International evidence shows that a full package of support and the right kind of work experience - ideally with pay and the prospect of a proper job at the end of it - is crucial.Forcing people into jobs at threat of financial sanction risks pushing them out of the system entirely and doesn't help them get a real job, which is not cost-effective.Neither can we ignore the extent of poor-quality jobs in the UK labour market. Getting on the ladder is vital but we need better and wider routes upwards out of poverty.There is nothing wrong with expecting the long-term unemployed to undertake work experience or an intensive job search, in fact it can really help.When done right, they give people the work habits and employability skills that employers are looking for.What's crucial is that schemes are designed to make people more likely to get a job, not less.Today's announcement builds on an earlier "mandatory work activity" pilot, which was found to have had no impact on future job prospects, only short-term breaks in JSA claims, and increased the numbers on disability benefit.Instead, drawing on the successful Future Jobs Fund, the government should guarantee a real job, created by the charitable sector and paid at the minimum wage, to anyone who has been out of work for a year.And insist that they take the job or lose their benefits - limiting the time someone can be unemployed.The social and economic consequences of long-term unemployment are well known.For individuals, it can mean detachment from the norms of work, skills losing currency and loss of confidence due to multiple knock-backs.Mechanisms that re-build labour market attachment are valuable but there is a need to recognise the multiple barriers faced, including the uneven geographic dispersion of work, which poses the challenge of economic regeneration.Long-term unemployment among young people is particularly problematic, and it is crucial that they receive interventions that help them to achieve traction in the labour market, which may include skills development as well as workplace experience.The longer someone is out of work the more challenging it becomes to find a job.Their skills and experience become out of date and their confidence is dented.Specialist help should kick in quickly, but currently the Work Programme is targeted at people who have been unemployed for a full 12 months.The benefits trap is also a real problem.People can be reluctant to take a temporary or part-time job even though it would be a great first step back into the workforce because they are worried that when it ends they might lose their benefits.Welfare reforms must tackle this perceived barrier.The government should tap into the expertise of professional recruiters.It's their job to have good relationships with employers and to understand their local labour markets.This can make them better placed than Jobcentre staff to provide advice about local opportunities.They can also give free, personal advice to jobseekers about how to perform well in interviews and how to make the most of themselves on their CVs.Very long-term unemployment (2+ years) is strongly cyclical, almost disappearing from 1998 to 2009, but has returned with the protracted period of poor economic performance.It is thus not a new phenomenon and a large range of policies have been tried before. We have a very good idea of what does and does not work.The effect of requiring people to go into work placements depends a lot on the quality of the work experience offered.They have three elements: first, some people leave benefits ahead of the required employment.This is called the deterrent effect and is stronger the more unpleasant and low paid (eg work for the dole) the placement is.Then, whilst on the placement, job search and job entry tend to fall off as the person's time is absorbed by working.Finally, the gaining of work experience raises job search success.This is stronger for high-quality job placement in terms of the experience gained and being with a regular employer who can give a good reference if the person has worked well.The net effect of many such programmes, including work for the dole, has often been little or even negative.But the best effects come where job search is actively required and supported when on a work placement, where the placement is with a regular employer rather than a "make work" scheme and where the placement provider is incentivised to care about the employment outcomes of the unemployed person after the work placement ends.Long-term unemployment is a major problem for many jobseekers, as those who have been out of work for a long time can lose confidence and feel that they have become unattractive to employers.George Osborne does sound as though he is unfairly trying to shift the onus onto the unemployed, when the government aren't really doing enough to generate new jobs.Despite this, the work placements outlined should help the long-term unemployed in theory, by giving them the chance to develop work-related skills and so on.The most important thing for those out of work is the development of new skills and experience, whether this is through work placements, free courses or taking on new responsibilities, along with maintaining their confidence and believing in their ability to get a job.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <description>Protesters demonstrating in support of teachers receiving better pay in the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo clash with police.</description>

      <body>Protesters demonstrating in support of teachers receiving better pay in the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have clashed with police.The centre of Rio was packed with more than 10,000 people marching peacefully.But as it got dark, some protesters threw firebombs at public buildings and riot police responded with tear gas.A similar protest in Sao Paulo also ended in violent confrontation with police after many banks were ransacked by hooded protesters.Brazil's security situation is a challenge to cities that will play host to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games.The latest demonstration took place over several hours and was peaceful at first.But once night fell, violent incidents broke out as at least 20 "black bloc" anarchists smashed a City Hall gate while others broke into banks and tried to break break into ATMs. Some banks were set alight.Demonstrators also torched a bus on busy Rio Branco Avenue, and took furniture out of banks to use in barricades as the stand-off off with police continued.Authorities used tear gas to restore order."Without the police, there is no violence. When they are there, there always is," said anarchist Hugo Cryois, 23, who had a gas mask dangling from his neck."I came prepared," he said. "You can't trust them."Teachers have been demanding a pay increase for two months. About 50,000 people were estimated to have marched to support them before the violence broke out, but police would only confirm the 10,000 estimate.</body>

      <title>Lampedusa death toll climbs to 232</title>
      <description>Italian divers "unpack a wall of people" from the sunken hull of a boat carrying African migrants that sank off Lampedusa island on Thursday.</description>

      <body>Italian divers have recovered dozens more bodies from a boat carrying African migrants that sank on Thursday.Thirty-eight bodies were freed from the hull, which divers had previously been unable to access. The official death toll now stands at 232.Divers "unpacked a wall of people", a navy officer said, adding that corpses were "so entwined one with the other" they were difficult to pull out.The boat caught fire and capsized close to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa.There were 155 survivors of the accident, which happened about 1km (half a mile) offshore.The operation to recover bodies from the hull was abandoned for the night, but will resume on Tuesday.,Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but last week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.The wreck is lying about 47m (155ft) below the surface, which means the recovery divers can only stay on the bottom for a short time.All the bodies around the ship and on deck have been brought to the surface, police say, however dozens more are thought to remain inside the vessel."I'm sure that the most difficult part of the operation is starting now. Technically it will be much more challenging," Coast Guard diver Rocco Pilon told Reuters news agency.Navy Captain Paolo Trucco said that debris had to be removed from the passageways leading to the hull."Mattresses, blankets, stairs. Anything that would float. Imagine if you put a house in a centrifuge and you see what winds up in the air. That is what happened," Mr Trucco told the Associated Press."Some [bodies] we have found with their arms outstretched. We try not to notice this kind of thing too much, otherwise the task is too difficult," said police diver Riccardo Nobile."We can see a woman's hair floating out of a broken porthole. But we haven't been able to get to her."The 20m (66ft) boat was carrying more than 500 people, mostly from Eritrea and Somalia.The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.The offence carries a 5,000-euro (£4,230; $6,780) fine.Italy has said it will amend its immigration laws. The authorities have denied allegations that they were slow to mount a rescue.France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.</body>

      <title>Hope for malaria vaccine by 2015</title>
      <description>UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will seek approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trials showed that it had reduced cases in African children.</description>

      <date>1381206650</date>
      <body>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is seeking regulatory approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trial data showed that it had cut the number of cases in African children.Experts say that they are optimistic about the possibility of the world's first vaccine after the trial results.Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide every year.Scientists say an effective vaccine is key to attempts to eradicate it.The vaccine known as RTS,S was found to have almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children in the trial and to have reduced by about 25% the number of malaria cases in infants.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing RTS,S with the non-profit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals," said Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso."Progress is being made with bed nets and other measures, but we need more tools to battle this terrible disease."The malaria trial was Africa's largest-ever clinical trial involving almost 15,500 children in seven countries.The findings were presented at a medical meeting in Durban, South Africa."Based on these data, GSK now intends to submit, in 2014, a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," GSK said in a statement.The company has been developing the vaccine for three decades.The statement said that the hope now is that the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) may recommend the use of the RTS,S vaccine from as early as 2015 if EMA drugs regulators back its licence application.Testing showed that 18 months after vaccination, children aged five to 17 months had a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated contemporaries.But in infants aged six to 12 weeks at the time of vaccination, there was only a 27% reduction in risk.A spokeswoman for GSK told the AFP news agency that the company would file its application to the EMA under a process aimed at facilitating new drugs for poorer countries.</body>

      <title>Australia PM Abbott in expenses row</title>
      <description>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is embroiled in a row over expenses claims, less than a month after taking office.</description>

      <body>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has become embroiled in a row over expenses claims, less than a month after taking office.Last week Mr Abbott paid back funds claimed to attend the weddings of two colleagues.On Tuesday he defended claims relating to two sporting events, saying both represented community engagement work.Tony Abbott, who heads a conservative coalition, ousted Kevin Rudd as prime minister in the 7 September election.Speaking at the Apec summit on the Indonesian island of Bali, Mr Abbott, an avid sportsman, said claims related to a triathlon event in which he competed in the town of Port Macquarie in 2011 were justified.''Let's not forget that Port Macquarie was a marginal seat effectively and I want to assure you that I don't go to marginal seats simply for sporting events, although the sporting event in question was a community event,'' he said.''I think you'll find there were quite a few other community events involved in those visits.''He also defended claims related to a multi-day charity cycling event known as Pollie Pedal, saying the trip took him ''to towns, communities, sometimes hamlets that rarely see a politician''.''It is a perfectly legitimate thing for a member of parliament to do," he said.Last week, Mr Abbott repaid a total of A$1,700 ($1,600, £995) claimed to attend the weddings of two former political allies in 2006.He said he checked his claims after two of his frontbenchers came under fire for expenses related to the wedding of a radio host. Both lawmakers have since repaid the funds.The opposition Labor party has called for the system to be tightened up."I don't think most MPs - the vast, vast, vast majority - are out to do anything wrong," Bill Shorten, who together with Anthony Albanese is contesting the Labor party leadership, told ABC radio."If there is this confusion and there is this uncertainty, then it does need to be cleaned up for the public confidence in the system," he added.Labor frontbencher Mark Dreyfus called for a "serious investigation", describing a "pattern of behaviour by Coalition MPs".However, later on Tuesday, it emerged that he would also return more than $400 ($370; £234) in incorrect expenses.He had claimed for accommodation for a weekend in Canberra, between two weeks when parliament was sitting, in August 2011.However, he was in fact skiing at Perisher Valley that weekend. The claim was an "an administrative error", his office said in a statement."Mr Dreyfus is sorry for the mistake and is repaying the $466," the statement added.</body>

      <title>Bolivia crackdown on coca agency</title>
      <description>The head of Bolivia's coca control agency is arrested over accusations of illegally selling seized coca, document fraud and extortion.</description>

      <body>The head of Bolivia's coca control and industrialisation agency has been arrested over accusations of illegally selling seized coca and other crimes.Prosecutors say Luis Cutipa diverted 45 tonnes of coca leaves and passed them on through his relatives to drug lords.Mr Cutipa is also accused of falsifying documents to get his job and benefitting from an increase in the price of coca sellers' licences.He denies any wrongdoing and says extra funds went to official bank accounts.Prosecutors say they will charge Luis Cutipa with neglect of duty, extortion, abuse of power and contravening laws and the Constitution.A separate investigation is looking into the alleged fraud over documents he presented to obtain his job.Mr Cutipa says he was forced to raise the price of licences after his agency lost funding following President Evo Morales' decision to expel the US Agency for International Development (USAID) from the country.According to Mr Cutipa, the funding cuts caused by the decision left him struggling to cover expenses.After reaching an agreement with coca growers, the price of a licence was raised from $87 (£54) to $170 (£110), he says.Mr Cutipa says that the extra income, amounitng to more than $500,000 (£310,000), was kept in official bank accounts.He also dismissed the accusations that his two sisters helped to sell 45 tonnes of seized coca as "slander".This is not the first time a high-ranking official in President Evo Morales' government has been embroiled in scandal, says the BBCs Will Grant.Two years ago, the former chief of the country's anti-narcotics police, General Rene Sanabria, was jailed for 14 years by a court in Miami for cocaine trafficking.He was working as an intelligence adviser to the government at the time of his arrest.</body>

      <body>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will undergo surgery on Tuesday to treat bleeding on her brain, doctors have said.Ms Fernandez, 60, was earlier ordered to rest for a month after doctors discovered the subdural haematoma.It was diagnosed as she was undergoing tests for another condition on Saturday.This means Ms Fernandez will have to suspend campaigning for congressional elections.The break from campaigning is considered awkward for the president as some opinion polls have suggested the government could lose control of Congress in the poll on 27 October.While her party has done well in the primaries on a nationwide level it has failed to win a key seat in the province of Buenos Aires, where her rival and former cabinet chief Sergio Massa beat Ms Fernandez's candidate.Medical experts say recovering from this type of surgery is a long process, and her lay-off is now likely to be longer than a month.It has not yet been officially announced whether Vice-President Amado Boudou, who is facing a corruption investigation, will be in charge of the country during her leave.The president's spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, issued a statement on Sunday saying her doctors had carried out a brain scan in August after a previously undisclosed trauma - thought to have been caused by a fall.They found nothing untoward, but on Saturday, she went to hospital for checks for an irregular heartbeat and headaches, and a further scan revealed the subdural haematoma - bleeding between the brain and the skull.The hospital treating her said on Monday she had experienced a slight loss of muscular strength in her left arm, and recommended surgery to drain the subdural hematoma.President Fernandez was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.Her health has been followed closely since the sudden death of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, from a heart attack in 2010.She has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions while serving as president. She has low blood pressure and had to have a thyroid gland removed in 2012.</body>

      <title>Karzai: Nato has caused suffering</title>
      <description>Afghan President Hamid Karzai tells BBC Newsnight that Nato has inflicted great suffering on the Afghan people, with insufficient gains.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24433433</url>
      <date>1381164852</date>
      <body>President Hamid Karzai has criticised Nato for failing to bring stability to Afghanistan in over a decade there."On the security front the entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure," he said.He said Nato had incorrectly focused the fight on Afghan villages rather than Taliban safe havens in Pakistan.Mr Karzai has just six months remaining in office until a successor is elected."I am not happy to say that there is partial security. That's not what we are seeking. What we wanted was absolute security and a clear-cut war against terrorism," Mr Karzai said of the Nato campaign.Speaking in one of his last major interviews before stepping down, he told BBC Newsnight that his priority now is to bring peace and security to Afghanistan, including a power-sharing deal with the Taliban.He said that his government was actively engaged in talks with the hardline Islamic group with this aim in mind:"They are Afghans. Where the Afghan president, the Afghan government can appoint the Taliban to a government job they are welcome," he said. "But where it's the Afghan people appointing people through elections to state organs then the Taliban should come and participate in elections."He dismissed concerns that bringing the Taliban back into government would sacrifice the tenuous gains on the status of women made in Afghanistan."The return of the Taliban will not undermine progress. This country needs to have peace. I am willing to stand for anything that will bring peace to Afghanistan and through that to promote the cause of the Afghan women better," he said."I have no doubt that there will be more Afghan young girls and women studying and getting higher education and better job opportunities. There is no doubt about that; even if the Taliban come that will not end, that will not slow down," he added.Before the elections for Mr Karzai's successor the United States is keen to finalise a bilateral security agreement which will also formalise US-Afghan relations following the 2014 Nato troop withdrawal.The US wants this signed by Mr Karzai, to avoid it becoming an election issue. However, the Afghan leader told Newsnight he was in no hurry to sign a pact:"If the agreement doesn't suit us then of course they can leave. The agreement has to suit Afghanistan's interests and purposes. If it doesn't suit us and if it doesn't suit them then naturally we will go separate ways."The US is becoming more and more pessimistic about the issue and has said it will consider a zero troops option.Mr Karzai has had troubled relations with his Western backers in recent years for openly criticising Nato, whom he has accused of having no respect for Afghan sovereignty.In 2009, US President Barack Obama described Mr Karzai as an unreliable and ineffective partner. However, speaking to Newsnight Mr Karzai dismissed the claim saying he was characterised in this manner "because where they want us to go along, we don't go along. They want us to keep silent when civilians are killed. We will not, we cannot".He said that in the years immediately following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan he had had good relations with the-then President George W Bush as in "those beginning years there was not much difference of opinion between us"."The worsening of relations began in 2005 where we saw the first incidents of civilian casualties, where we saw that the war on terror was not conducted where it should have been."Mr Karzai said the war should have been conducted "in the sanctuaries, in the training grounds beyond Afghanistan, rather than that which the US and Nato forces were conducting operations in Afghan villages, causing harm to Afghan people."There has also been much criticism of the Afghan government's failure to deal with corruption, which along with lack of progress on significantly improving women's rights, saw Norway cutting some its aid to the country last week."Our government is weak and ineffective in comparison to other governments, we've just begun," Mr Karzai said. "But the big corruption, the hundreds of millions of dollars of corruption, it was not Afghan. Now everybody knows that. It was foreign."The contracts, the subcontracts, the blind contracts given to people, money thrown around to buy loyalties, money thrown around to buy submissiveness of Afghan government officials, to policies and designs that the Afghans would not agree to. That was the major part of corruption," he said.</body>

      <body>Powerful Typhoon Fitow has killed at least five people in China, with four others missing, local media report.The tropical cyclone hit China's eastern coast early on Monday, with winds of up to 151km/h (93mph).The storm flattened houses, flooded villages and farms, and affected more than 4.5m people, officials said.It has caused economic losses of more than 21bn yuan ($3.4bn; £2.1bn), officials in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces said.Two people died in Wenzhou, in Zhejiang province, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.Three people in Ruian, also in Zhejiang, died from electric shocks, the agency added.Rescue operations were underway, with footage on state television showing stranded residents being picked up by speed boats.State media described shrimp farms and seaweed farms being damaged by the storm and powerful winds."We have basically lost everything this year," a seaweed farmer told reporters.Typhoon Fitow - named after a flower - made landfall at 01:15 local time on Monday (17:15 GMT Sunday) in the city of Fuding, Chinese meteorologists said.It triggered the evacuate of hundreds of thousands in Zhejiang and Fujian, and caused transport chaos as train, coach and flight services were cancelled.It came just weeks after Typhoon Usagi killed at least 25 people in southern Guangdong province.</body>

      <title>Plastic pollution 'threatens lakes'</title>
      <description>Researchers say that the problem of plastic pollution is posing a growing threat to lakes as well as oceans.</description>

      <date>1381183230</date>
      <body>Pollution with plastic waste is not confined to the oceans but poses a growing threat to lakes as well.That is the view of researchers who found significant concentrations of the substance in Italy's Lake Garda.They say the levels are similar to those found in samples taken from marine beach sediments.They are concerned that these tiny plastic particles are accumulating in freshwater species and are "likely" to get into the food chain.The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.The problem of large amounts of plastic polluting the world's oceans has been well documented in recent years.As well as bigger pieces that can choke sea creatures when ingested, there is an equally serious issue with very small fragments called micro-plastics.But research on the problems caused by plastic in lakes has been lacking.This new study looked at Lake Garda, a large, sub-alpine body of water. The researchers found significant concentrations of plastic in sediment samples. On the north shore they found around 1,000 larger particles per square metre and 450 micro-plastic particles in the same area."We were surprised," lead author Prof Christian Laforsch from the University of Bayreuth told BBC News."We have similar amounts of plastic particles in the sediment of the lake's ecosystem as we find in marine ecosystems."Chemicals found in plastics can be poisonous, can damage endocrine systems or in some cases cause cancers.They can also transport dangerous organic pollutants into clean environments like lakes.Previous research on fish and other marine creatures has shown that these species tend to accumulate tiny plastic fragments into their tissue. Prof Laforsch worries that this is happening in Lake Garda and elsewhere."What we show is that filter feeders and sediment feeders and organisms that feed on the surface layer of the lake, all swallow these plastic particles mistaking them for food."There might be impacts when it affects the hormone system, they could become sterile for example. It could also be, that when fish are feeding on these organisms they accumulate these particles also in their tissue."The problem is being caused by human use of plastic materials say the researchers.Apart from water sports, and tourist and fishing boats, the main sources of waste entering Lake Garda were discarded plastic products and debris which may originate from landfill sites.The scientists are also concerned that the discovery of significant amounts of plastic in lake environments could have implications for human populations as the waters are often used for drinking and for agriculture.And they argue that, as in the seas, plastic pollution is likely to be widespread in freshwater bodies."There is nothing particular about Lake Garda," said Prof Laforsch."We are testing in Bavaria and it looks pretty much the same. It is, I think, a problem all over Europe and maybe all over the world."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Euro MPs vote on anti-tobacco rules</title>
      <description>The European Parliament is to vote on tougher tobacco regulations especially aimed at preventing younger people from taking up smoking.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381219629</date>
      <body>Euro MPs will vote shortly on new measures aimed at putting young people off smoking, including bigger health warnings on cigarette packets and restrictions on electronic cigarettes.Under the draft legislation from the European Commission e-cigarettes would become a medicinal product.Menthol cigarettes could be banned, along with other flavoured tobacco.Packs of 10 as well as slim cigarettes - marketed mainly to women - would no longer be sold.Smaller packs are reckoned to be more attractive to young smokers.It is the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on chewing tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.Once agreed, all 28 EU countries will have to make the measures law.After Tuesday's vote there will be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives and should not be restricted because they could dramatically reduce smoking-related diseases.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking."Tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products," said EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg, presenting the proposals.The current requirement for health warnings on packets is 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.The new packaging requirements would also apply to roll-your-own tobacco.The legislation would allow member states the option of plain, non-branded packaging "in duly justified cases".The Commission says packets must be big enough to ensure full visibility for the health warnings, so the recommendation is at least 20 cigarettes per pack.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. It is argued that bigger, more expensive packets are less attractive to young smokers.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The associated costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <title>Canada to review Commonwealth aid</title>
      <description>Canada is reviewing its financial support for the Commonwealth over alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, PM Stephen Harper says.</description>

      <body>Canada is reviewing its financial support for the Commonwealth in protest against alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said.Mr Harper also confirmed he would boycott the group's November 2013 summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital.Canada is the second-largest financial contributor to the organisation of 53 former British territories.Sri Lanka has previously dismissed its objections as biased and unfair.Chitranganee Wagiswara, the Sri Lankan high commissioner in Ottawa, told the BBC it was "up to each country to decide on participation".She noted there had not been 100% attendance at previous summits, and that next month the UK, Australia and New Zealand were still planning to attend.On Monday, Mr Harper said he had not taken the decision to boycott the meeting lightly."Canada is deeply concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka," Mr Harper said in a statement."The absence of accountability for the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian standards during and after the civil war is unacceptable."Mr Harper cited the recent impeachment of the Sri Lankan chief justice, as well as "ongoing reports" of the incarceration of political leaders and journalists and allegations of disappearances and extra-judicial killings."The Sri Lankan government has failed to uphold the Commonwealth's core values, which are cherished by Canadians," he said.Ms Wagiswara dismissed Mr Harper's condemnation."One cannot say that there is no accountability," the high commissioner said. "It's only four years since the end of the [Sri Lankan civil war]. If there are any human rights violations the government is looking into them."And she rejected Mr Harper's comment that Sri Lanka had failed to uphold Commonwealth values."From our point of view, we are a functioning democracy," Ms Wagiswara said.Deepak Obhrai, parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and for International Human Rights, will attend the summit in Mr Harper's place.Mr Harper had previously threatened to boycott the Sri Lankan summit.Canada contributes about 20 million Canadian dollars ($19.4m; £12m) each year to the Commonwealth, including C$5m to the secretariat, which runs the group. A loss of Canadian financing could threaten the organisation, analysts say.The prime minister also confirmed on Monday at the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bali, Indonesia, that Canada would review its financial contributions to the Commonwealth."Obviously we will examine our engagement and our financing of the Commonwealth, which is quite considerable, to make sure that we are wisely using taxpayer dollars and reflecting Canadian values," he told reporters.New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott said they would attend, the Canadian Press news agency reports.Canada is home to the largest expatriate Sri-Lankan Tamil community. Many of them migrated over the last few decades as civil war gripped Sri Lanka.In 2009, Sri Lanka's army defeated the ethnic-Tamil rebels after a brutal 26-year war that left at least 100,000 people dead.Both sides were accused of human rights abuses throughout the conflict, with much focus on its final stages when thousands of civilians were trapped in a thin strip of land in the north of Sri Lanka as fighting raged around them.Estimates of civilian deaths in the final months range widely from 9,000 to 75,000.</body>

      <title>'More than 50' African billionaires</title>
      <description>Africa has 55 billionaires with a combined wealth of nearly $144bn (£89bn), far more than previously thought, a financial magazine says.</description>

      <body>Africa has 55 billionaires, far more than previously thought, Nigeria-based Ventures financial magazine says.They include three women - the mother of Kenya's president, a daughter of Angola's president and a Nigerian oil tycoon and fashion designer.The richest man is Nigeria's Aliko Dangote, with a fortune of $20.2bn (£12.5bn), Ventures said.The list is likely to reignite debate about inequality between rich and poor people in Africa, correspondents say.In April, the World Bank said the number of people living in extreme poverty in Africa had risen in the past three decades from 205 million to 414 million.A report earlier this month by research group Afrobarometer suggested that economic growth in Africa was primarily benefiting a small elite.This is the first time the respected Ventures magazine has published a list of rich Africans, reports the BBC's Tomi Oladipo reports from Nigeria's main city Lagos.The 55 billionaires it has identified are more numerous than the 16 super rich Africans listed by US financial magazine Forbes last year.It was able to identify dozens more billionaires by using "on-the-ground knowledge" to overcome hurdles that may have "hampered" other researchers, Ventures said.The magazine estimated the 55 billionaires' combined fortunes at $143.88bn, an average of a $2.6bn per person.Of the 55, 20 are Nigerian, nine are South African and eight are Egyptian, Ventures said.The richest woman is Nigeria's Folorunsho Alakija, who made her $7.3bn fortune mainly in the country's oil industry, it added.She also studied fashion in London and made dresses for Maryam Babangida, the late wife of Nigerian military ruler Ibrahim Babangida, Ventures said.Isabel Dos Santos, an Angolan investor and the eldest daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, together with Ngina Kenyatta, the mother of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, also made the cut, it added.Ventures listed Harvard-trained businessman Allan Gray as South Africa's richest man, with a fortune of $8.5bn."This media-shy South African moneyman controls two investment companies that collectively manage over $50bn in assets," Ventures said.Nathan Kirsh, a property tycoon in the tiny kingdom of Swaziland, also made it on the list.He is worth $3.6bn, and has business interests in London and New York, Ventures said.Ventures editor-in-chief Uzo Iweala told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that its estimate of 50 billionaires was probably conservative."There is this culture of you don't necessarily want to show your wealth, considering the gap between rich and poor," he said."If you have a lot of money, there are a lot of people that you have to support so we think people may be a little reluctant to be all splashy about what they have and what their assets are."</body>

      <body>Iranians have used social media to mock Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after he suggested they were not allowed to wear jeans.In an interview with BBC Persian TV Mr Netanyahu said that if Iranians were free they would wear blue jeans, and listen to Western music.Hundreds of Iranians both in Iran and abroad reacted on social media sites.Many posts showed mainly young Iranians wearing jeans and listening to Western music, some in comic poses.Others mocked up scenes from ancient Persian history with the protagonists wearing denim.Jeans are not banned in Iran, where an Islamic dress code requires women to cover their hair and wear modest outer clothing. Some Western music or Western-style music is tolerated.One picture on social media sites showed a young boy in jeans whispering into the ear of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Another is a doctored photograph of Mr Netanyahu's address at the UN last year in which he drew a red line across a sketch of a bomb, to warn that Iran was moving closer to the metaphorical "red line" of gaining enough highly-enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb.In the mocked-up picture, widely-shared on Twitter, the bomb has been replaced with a picture of a female figure wearing jeans, with the Israeli prime minister appearing to draw a red line across the thighs.In the BBC Persian interview, broadcast on Friday, Mr Netanyahu said that Iranians "deserve better" than their current government:"I think if the Iranian people had their way, they'd be wearing blue jeans, they'd have Western music, they'd have free elections."The Israel's prime minister also said that the lives of Iranians could get worse if it gained nuclear weapons.One Iranian response on a Facebook page that has attracted hundreds of followers read: "He thinks he saw our bomb but he hasn't seen our jeans."</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>

      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <title>Kerry defends US Libya capture</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry defends the US seizure of a suspected al-Qaeda leader in Libya, who he said was a "legal and appropriate target".</description>

      <date>1381178024</date>
      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the capture of an alleged al-Qaeda leader, Anas al-Liby, calling him a "legal and appropriate target".He is a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Africa.His son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father was seized by masked gunmen and that some of them were Libyans.Mr Kerry's comments come after Libya called on the US to explain the raid on its territory, one of two by US commandos in Africa on Saturday.Mr Kerry said Anas al-Liby, who has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head, would face justice in a court of law."With respect to Abu Anas al-Liby, he is a key al-Qaeda figure, and he is a legal and an appropriate target for the US military," Mr Kerry told reporters on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Indonesia.Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification on the raid and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya"."The Libyan government has been following the reports of the kidnap of one of the Libyan citizens wanted by the authorities in the United States," said a Libyan government statement issued on Sunday."As soon as it heard the reports, the Libyan government contacted the US authorities to demand an explanation."Citing surveillance camera footage, Mr Liby's son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday by masked gunmen armed with pistols, as he was parking outside his house.He said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect.He claims the Libyan government was implicated in his father's disappearance - a claim Tripoli denies.Mr Liby's brother, Nabih, on Sunday told reporters his brother was innocent, describing the US operation as an "act of piracy".Anas al-Liby - real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.The 49-year-old has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks.On Saturday, US commandos also carried out a raid in southern Somalia, but failed to capture their target.Pentagon spokesman George Little confirmed on Monday that they were chasing Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, a Kenyan al-Shabab commander also known as Ikrima.He is alleged to have been involved in plotting a number of attacks in Kenya.Al-Shabab has said it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: "Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret."Mr Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".</body>

      <body>The US Supreme Court begins its new term this week with an agenda full of high-profile cases on social issues ranging from reproductive rights to affirmative action.On Tuesday, the court will hear a campaign finance follow-on to its controversial 2010 Citizens United decision.That 5-4 ruling allowed corporations to offer unlimited funds in support of or opposition to political candidates.The court term will end in June 2014.The court's first major case - McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission - is a challenge to the overall limits an individual can give to political action committees, candidates and parties in a two-year federal election cycle.The court has scrutinised several campaign finance laws in recent years, including Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, which freed corporations and labour unions to make unlimited contributions in candidate elections.Other high-profile cases on the court's agenda this term include National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning, which will test US President Barack Obama's ability to bypass the Senate in making recess appointments.Two abortion cases are also scheduled to be argued before the court this term, one of which challenges a Massachusetts state law restricting protests near reproductive health facilities.Later this month, the court will also hear arguments in Schuette v Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, which challenges whether the state of Michigan can ban affirmative action in higher education."This term, like the past couple of terms, what we have is the court taking [on] a broad range of highly salient social issues," Goldstein and Russell counsel Tejinder Singh told the BBC."There's no clear trend yet in terms of what issues interest the court, but what is clear is the court is not being shy about loading its docket with high-profile cases with potentially substantial ramifications."</body>

      <body>Brazil has summoned the Canadian ambassador for explanations over the latest electronic spying accusations leaked by the former US intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden.Canadian intelligence monitored communications of the mines and energy ministry, Brazilian TV Globo reported.President Dilma Rousseff wrote on Twitter the US and its allies "must stop spying activities immediately."Recent reports have suggested that she had also been a target of US spies.Brazil's Foreign minister, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo, said he has told the Canadian ambassador in Brasilia, Jamal Khokhar, that he was "indignant.""The government expresses its repudiation of this serious and unacceptable violation of the national sovereignty and of people's and company's rights," the minister's statement read.On Sunday evening, a popular TV show, which had already broadcast spying allegations involving President Rousseff and the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, aired the the latest leaks revealed by the Rio de Janeiro-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald, a reporter for Britain's Guardian newspaper.Canadian officials told their US, British, New Zealand and Australian counterparts – the group reportedly known as Five Eyes – that they had successfully monitored a communications network of the mines and energy ministry, the report said.The network is said to be frequently used in exchanges between the ministry, energy and oil agencies and the state oil and energy companies.Writing on Twitter shortly after Sunday's report was aired, President Dilma Rousseff demanded a change by the US authorities and noted that she had already criticised the spying at the United Nations General Assembly, in September.She also instructed the ministry to step up the security measures surrounding its networks.On Monday, Ms Rousseff used the social media network to say that the activities were "inadmissible among countries that aim to be partners.""We repudiate the cyber warfare," she wrote.Speaking at the opening of the UN General Assembly, Ms Rousseff said Brazil would adopt legislation and technology to protect itself from illegal intercepts.She called Washington's argument that spying on Brazil helped protect against terrorism "untenable"."Brazil, Mr President, knows how to protect itself," she said.Earlier this month, she cancelled a planned visit to Washington.Ms Rousseff asked the UN to play a leading role in regulating electronic technology and said Brazil would present proposals for a "civilian multilateral framework" for the governance and use of the internet and to protect web-based data.</body>

      <body>Hundreds of Brazilian security officers, backed by armoured vehicles and helicopters, have occupied 12 shanty towns in Rio de Janeiro.The major operation is part of an ongoing drive by authorities to push drug gangs away from poor areas.Two new police pacification units (UPP) will be set up in Lins de Vasconcellos, home to about 15,000 people.Since 2008, another 34 UPP have been set up across the state but there have also been reports of police brutality.Rio will host the 2016 Olympics and matches of next year's football World Cup.Hundreds of police officers backed by at least two armoured vehicles and three helicopters moved into the slums at dawn on Sunday.The gangs in the area offered no resistance, authorities said."This is another step towards peace," Rio state governor Sergio Cabral Filho told reporters.He said the government would now invest $225m (£140m) in public works to improve the living conditions in the area.At least one man was arrested, and guns and drugs were confiscated, police said.Governor Cabral Filho said the pacification programme would soon be extended to the Mare area - a series of interlinked shanty towns that are home to more than 130,000 people.The occupation of the Mare slums is seen as one of the most challenging by Rio authorities.Earlier this year, police occupied the shanty towns of Complexo do Caju and Barreira do Vasco without trouble.But 10 police officers of a UPP in one of Rio's largest slums, Rocinha, were accused of torturing and killing a resident.Bricklayer Amarildo de Souza disappeared in July and was never seen again. The officers reject the accusations.</body>

      <title>Shabab fighters deploy after US raid</title>
      <description>Somali militant group al-Shabab sends extra fighters to the town of Barawe, where US commandos tried to seize one of its leaders on Saturday, residents tell the BBC.</description>

      <body>Somali militant group al-Shabab has sent reinforcements to the town of Barawe, where US commandos tried to seize one of its leaders on Saturday, residents have told the BBC.The residents say about 200 masked fighters have arrived in the coastal town with heavy machine guns.The American raid targeted a Kenyan Somali known as Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, alias Ikrima.The operation follows last month's attack on a Kenyan shopping centre.Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, has said it carried out the attack, in which at least 67 people were killed.On the same day as the raid in Somalia, US forces seized alleged al-Qaeda leader Anas al-Liby from the Libyan capital Tripoli.He is a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania.Barawe residents say Ikrima is an al-Shabab leader with responsibility for logistics, who is usually accompanied by about 20 well-armed guards.Pentagon spokesman George Little said Ikrima was closely associated with Harun Fazul and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, who helped with the 1998 embassy bombings and the 2002 attacks on a hotel and airline in Mombasa.Nabhan was killed in a 2009 US air strike in Barawe. Harun Fazul, also known as Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, was apparently killed by police in Mogadishu in 2011."While the operation did not result in Ikrima's capture, US military personnel conducted the operation with unparalleled precision," said Mr Little.He said the operation "demonstrated that the US can put direct pressure on al-Shabab leadership at any time of our choosing".According to a Kenyan intelligence report leaked to the US media, Ikrima was planning to attack targets in Kenya last year, including the Westgate shopping mall.British citizen Samantha Lewthwaite was also named as having links to the planned attacks, the report says.Early on Saturday morning the US forces approached a villa near the Indian Ocean coast where Ikrima is said to stay from time to time.As they were putting up a ladder outside the building, a guard reportedly sounded the alarm, leading to an exchange of gunfire which lasted about 20 minutes.The US forces then withdrew to the beach, got into speedboats and returned to a waiting ship, said residents of the town, which is 180km (110 miles) south of the capital Mogadishu.Al-Shabab has said that one of its fighters was killed during the attack.The BBC's Mohammed Moalimu in Mogadishu says that residents are now afraid to use their phones in case they are accused of being US spies.Al-Shabab has controlled the town since 2008.When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: "Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret."US Secretary of State John Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".The US has a huge military base in neighbouring Djibouti, from where it carries out many of its operations in Somalia.Al-Shabab has been forced out of most of Somalia's major cities in the past two years but it still controls many rural parts of southern and central Somalia.In 2008, al-Shabab commander Aden Hashi Ayro was assassinated in a US air strike in central Somalia.Last year, US Navy Seals parachuted from a plane into central Somalia to free US aid worker Jessica Buchanan and her Danish colleague Poul Thisted.US officials said at the time the two were held by criminals, not Islamists.</body>

      <body>At least nine Egyptian soldiers and police officers have been killed in two attacks in different regions.Officials said a car bomb killed three police officers in southern Sinai, hours after masked gunmen shot dead six soldiers in a patrol car outside the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya.Rockets also hit a government-run satellite station in Cairo. No group has said it carried out the attacks.Dozens died on Sunday in clashes between Islamists and security forces.Thousands of supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi fought with security forces in Cairo, in the most intense violence for several weeks.Cairo itself has returned to calm, although the Islamists have urged their supporters to continue their protests.In Monday's string of attacks:Police in Qaliubiya, north of Cairo, arrested 38 members of the Muslim Brotherhood carrying petrol bombs, firecrackers and masks as they stormed a metro station, reported Mena state news agency.The Brotherhood members "opened fire on police troops and residents and destroyed entrance and exit gates of the station", it said.Security forces have been the frequent victims of attacks in northern Sinai, where analysts say a fully fledged insurgency is building.But the south of the peninsula, which is a centre of tourism, had remained largely peaceful until the attack in al-Tour on Monday.The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Cairo says Sinai is a magnet for militants, and weapons have been shipped there from Libya.The Egyptian military is in the middle of its biggest operation in Sinai for many years, he adds.Monday's attacks will raise further fears of a confrontation between Islamists and the army, correspondents say.</body>

      <title>New Indian outbreak of encephalitis</title>
      <description>Fifteen children have died over the last few days in a fresh outbreak of viral encephalitis in India's Uttar Pradesh state, taking this year's toll to 358.</description>

      <body>Fifteen children have died in the past few days in a fresh outbreak of viral encephalitis in India's Uttar Pradesh state, taking this year's toll to 358.The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas and children are the worst affected.More than 200 patients are still being treated at government hospitals.At least 6,500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the first case was detected in 1978.Gorakhpur and adjoining districts which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas are low-lying and prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus.The Press Trust of India on Tuesday reported that 15 children had died of the disease in the past few days, taking this year's toll in the state to 358.Doctors say affected patients come from between 10 and 12 districts in the region, and are mostly the rural poor.Until 2005, doctors say that the the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus.But in the past seven years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.The diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure and inflammation of the heart and kidney.Doctors say children between the age of six months and 15 years are the worst affected.A fifth of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.The government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of encephalitis in the region.Last week, India launched a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis as part of a national programme to fight the virus."Beginning with the first report in 1955 in Tamil Nadu state, the Japanese encephalitis virus has now spread to more than 171 districts in 19 states," Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the launch of the vaccine.In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur killed 1,000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since 1978.</body>

      <title>Abenomics 'may take decade' to work</title>
      <description>Japan's aggressive policies aimed at reviving its economy may take 10 years to have a full impact, Japanese minister Akira Amari tells the BBC.</description>

      <date>1381219116</date>
      <body>Japan's aggressive policies aimed at reviving its economy may take 10 years to have a full impact, Akira Amari, Japan's minister in charge of economic revitalisation, has told the BBC.Known as Abenomics, these include easing monetary policy, boosting stimulus and reforming key sectors.Some of these steps have already been introduced and have boosted growth.But he warned that while it is easy to implement monetary stimulus measures, scaling them back can be tricky.He told the BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, that Japan's central bank was likely to "learn from the experiences" of the US Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to reduce its key stimulus programme in the coming months."The Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, is experimenting with it," Mr Amari said in an exclusive interview with the BBC."That's why one word from him can move stocks and currencies."Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who came to power in December last year, has made reviving the economy his top priority.He has unveiled a series of aggressive measures to try to achieve that.The measures are based on what are known as the "three arrows" - monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms - to ensure long-term sustainable growth in the world's third-largest economy,The first arrow of monetary policy is aimed at ending Japan's nearly two-decades-long fight with deflation or falling prices.One of the first steps that Mr Abe took was to get Japan's central bank to double its inflation target to 2%. He has even suggested that the bank should print "unlimited yen" to help achieve its inflation target.The second arrow has prompted Mr Abe's government to announce plans to boost government spending on infrastructure, in order to help boost growth further.Mr Amari told the BBC that the steps had already had a positive impact on the Japanese economy.Revised data released last month showed that Japan's economy expanded 0.9% in the April-to-June quarter from the previous three months. That translates into an annualised growth of 3.8%.Meanwhile, consumer prices in Japan have now risen for three months in a row.Mr Amari said that the third arrow - reforming key sectors - was aimed at encouraging private investment in the country, which will aid growth even more.He said that "Abenomics aims to raise total capital investment by 10% within three years", adding that the target was not a difficult one to achieve."It can be achieved in one-and-a-half years. The aim is to replace low productivity facilities with higher productivity ones."However, he added that the government had "dozens of targets" in terms of sectors where it wants to boost investment and "each has its own timeframe, whether it's three or 10 years".He said the government planned to introduce tax incentives, to encourage companies to increase their investment."By increasing investment by 10%, growth will be raised by 1.3%," he added.</body>

      <title>Sarkozy secret cash case 'dropped'</title>
      <description>A criminal investigation into French former President Nicolas Sarkozy over alleged secret campaign financing in the "Bettencourt affair" is dropped, judicial sources say.</description>

      <body>A criminal investigation into former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, for allegedly soliciting secret campaign financing from France's richest woman, has been dropped, judicial sources say.Mr Sarkozy has been left off a list of those to appear for trial over the so-called Bettencourt affair, they say.He had denied visiting L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt - alleged to be mentally frail - to solicit cash.The decision could leave Mr Sarkozy, 58, clear to contest the 2017 election.Although unpopular when he lost his attempt to be re-elected in 2012, opinion polls now suggest he would beat President Francois Hollande in a re-run.He has hinted at a comeback, saying earlier this year that he might have to return to "save" France from economic disaster under President Hollande.The possibility of a criminal case against him has, therefore, gripped the media in France.Mrs Bettencourt's accountant, Claire Thibout, has said she withdrew 150,000 euros (£125,000) in cash that was to be passed to Mr Sarkozy's conservative UMP party in the run-up to his presidential election victory in 2007.Individual campaign contributions in France are limited to 4,600 euros annually.Mrs Bettencourt's butler testified that Mr Sarkozy was a regular visitor to her home during his 2007 campaign.But Mr Sarkozy insisted that he only saw Mrs Bettencourt once in that year.The argument came to a dramatic head in March, when a judge summoned both Mr Sarkozy and the butler for a face-to-face encounter, after which preliminary charges were filed against the former president.He was charged with taking advantage of Mrs Bettencourt, by accepting cash from her when she was too frail to know what she was doing.Mrs Bettencourt, now 90, has suffered from dementia since 2006, the AFP news agency reports.Ten people are still facing trial over the case, Le Monde reports.They include Mr Sarkozy's former campaign aide and UMP treasurer - and later, the French budget minister - Eric Woerth, Le Monde says.Bettencourt staff say Mr Woerth visited the house several times to pick up envelopes stuffed full of cash. He denies doing so.It had never been alleged that Mr Sarkozy personally received money.He still faces investigation in other cases - including another related to his 2007 presidential run, in which it is alleged that he received funding from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi - which he strongly denies.</body>

      <title>Press plan for regulation 'rejected'</title>
      <description>Senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have rejected the press's own favoured version of a royal charter for press regulation, the BBC's Newsnight has learned.</description>

      <date>1381217527</date>
      <body>Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.A source said a sub-committee of the Privy Council, containing Lib Dem and Tory cabinet ministers, thought the proposals were "flawed".But sub-committee chair Danny Alexander insisted no decision had been made.The full Privy Council is also looking at an alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners.It is due to announce its decision on the press proposals on Wednesday and the alternative plan on 30 October.Press regulation options are being considered in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, which was set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Politicians and the press have been at odds over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the regulator.The government's proposals published in March have cross-party backing and the support of campaign group Hacked Off.There are a series of key differences between the industry's plan for press regulation and that agreed by politicians and campaigners.Newsnight's political editor Allegra Stratton was told Privy Council members felt proposals for self-regulation put forward by newspapers did not meet the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report.Mr Alexander, who told the BBC the sub-committee met on Monday and the full Privy Council will meet on Wednesday to consider the press proposal, said there were a "few remaining" details to be decided - but insisted "no final decision has been made".But ministers "do look set to reject" the form of regulation put forward by newspapers, BBC political editor Nick Robinson said.The Privy Council sub-committee sub-committee consists of four Tories and two Lib Dems - and both parties have been critical of the press proposals - he added.Steve Hewlett, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, told Newsnight that newspaper publishers felt the process had been far from transparent.He said: "People I have spoken to are furious and are now considering whether there might be a legal challenge to this decision by the Privy Council."The newspapers' proposals would:Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of the Sun, said the news was not a shock."It's what we'd been given fairly clear clues would happen," he said."I think it has to be seen as a great victory for the forces of oppression of a free press - Hacked Off in particular - and the politicians who have gone along for the ride."Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said the press's plan had been a "delaying manoeuvre" by the big national newspapers."The problem with the papers is that they do not want to deal fairly with complaints," he said.Mr Cathcart said there was a "rare unanimity" in Parliament on this issue, and the press was refusing to compromise "like an errant child on the naughty step with his fingers in his ears".He said only the press stood against the consensus in politics and the public which said: "We want Parliament's royal charter - Leveson's royal charter - and we want it now."Earlier, Gerry McCann said the newspaper industry's plans for press regulation were "a gentlemen's club agreement" and should be rejected by politicians.The father of missing Madeleine McCann said the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry were the "minimum acceptable".Mr McCann and his family were subject to intense press attention after Madeleine went missing while they were on holiday in Portugal in 2007.</body>

      <title>Israelis mourn Rabbi Ovadia Yosef</title>
      <description>Vast crowds attend the Jerusalem funeral of influential rabbi and founder of the Shas party Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who died aged 93.</description>

      <body>Several hundred thousand people have attended the funeral in Jerusalem of influential Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.The rabbi, who was the leader of the Sephardic Jewish community, died earlier on Monday at the age of 93.Orthodox Jews wearing black clothing congregated outside the seminary where he studied. Israeli police said more than 700,000 people were participating in the funeral.An ambulance service spokesperson said 40 people had received minor injuries.Crowds of people surrounded the van carrying Rabbi Yosef's body. Streets have been closed off and thousands of additional police deployed."We estimate there are more the 700,000 people taking part in the largest of funerals ever in Israel," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said on Twitter.The rabbi was a leading Torah scholar and arbiter of Halacha, or Jewish law.He was also the spiritual leader of the Shas party, which he founded in 1984 to boost representation for Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin.Until then, Israel's government and religious institutions had tended to be dominated by Ashkenazi Jews - those of European descent.Though it is currently in opposition, Shas became a kingmaker in several coalition governments.Shas leader Arye Deri wept uncontrollably following the announcement of the rabbi's death."How will we remain alone? Who will lead us?" he asked, referring to the rabbi as "our father".Israel's President Shimon Peres had visited the rabbi in hospital as his condition deteriorated on Monday.The president and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were both present for the funeral, which took place on the day of the rabbi's death in accordance with Jewish custom.Mr Netanyahu had expressed "deep sorrow" at the news of Rabbi Yosef's death, describing him as "among the greatest rabbis of our generation"."Rabbi Ovadia was a giant in Torah and Jewish law and a teacher for tens of thousands," he said in a statement."The Jewish People have lost one of the wisest men of this generation."The Iraqi-born cleric was also known for his controversial comments about Arabs, secular Jews, liberals, women and gay people.He once likened Palestinians to snakes, and in 2010 called for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to "vanish from our world".However, he also encouraged Israeli politicians to engage in the peace process with the Palestinians and by abstaining, helped secure the passage of the first Oslo peace accord through the Knesset.President Abbas, meeting visiting Israeli MPs in Ramallah on Monday, asked them to send his condolences to Rabbi Yosef's family.The rabbi's son, Yitzhak Yosef, is the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel.</body>

      <title>Saudi jailed over daughter's death</title>
      <description>A Saudi preacher accused of torturing his five-year-old daughter and beating her to death has been sentenced to eight years in jail and 600 lashes.</description>

      <body>A Saudi preacher accused of torturing his five-year-old daughter and beating her to death has been sentenced to eight years in prison and 600 lashes.The case of Fayhan al-Ghamdi made headlines around the world earlier this year when it was suggested that a Saudi court might let him walk free.Activists began a campaign named after his daughter, "I am Lama", to press the authorities to prevent that happening.Al-Ghamdi is not recognised as a cleric by the Saudi religious establishment.The horrific details of the abuse that Lama al-Ghamdi suffered were revealed in medical records from the hospital where she was treated for 10 months before she died.Her ribs were broken, a fingernail was torn off and her skull crushed. She had been beaten with a cane and electric cables. She had also suffered burns.The abuse had happened while she was with her father, who was separated from her mother.It was reported that al-Ghamdi had suspected his daughter of losing her virginity and had beaten her and molested her in response.It was even suggested that he had raped her himself, although this was denied by Lama's mother.The outrage over the case intensified earlier this year when activists suggested that he might walk free, despite having confessed to having beaten Lama.The judge in the case suggested that one reading of Islamic law meant a father could not be held fully accountable for the death of his children.Activists warned that it looked like he might be released if the mother accepted blood money.The story grabbed headlines across the world.It shone a light on child abuse in Saudi Arabia where rights activists say strict codes of family privacy and a patriarchal tradition make it a serious problem.The Saudi authorities set up a child abuse helpline in response.Now, a verdict has been reached in the same court and with the same judge.One of the activists involved in the campaign, Aziz al-Yousef, told the BBC that she was disappointed that Fayhan al-Ghamdi did not receive a life sentence.But Lama's mother had in the end accepted the offer of blood money, despite having once said she would never take it.She said she needed it to help support her surviving children. That ruled out a life sentence.Another campaigner who fought for a longer sentence, Manal al-Sharif, told the BBC that she did not believe the penalty was enough.But she does feel that the I am Lama campaign - with the international pressure it brought to bear on the authorities - was instrumental in leading to the recent introduction of an unprecedented new Saudi law against domestic violence.However, she added that she still has deep reservations over how effectively this will be enforced in practice.</body>

      <body>Excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.The College of Emergency Medicine said increased demand and the complexity of work was causing staff sickness and burnout.Its survey of just over 1,000 UK consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable.It comes amid mounting concern about the ability of AandE units to cope this winter.At the start of this year, the NHS in England missed its target of fewer than 5% of patients waiting more than four hours, as waiting times hit their highest rates for nine years.Ministers have since announced a £500m bailout fund for the next two winters to help those hospitals with the most acute problems.The college has always maintained that a shortage of doctors is a contributory factor to the problems.Previous reports have highlighted the fact that AandEs do not have enough consultants.The average is just over seven per unit when it should be 10 - and 16 for the largest hospitals - according to the college.But now the college is warning that the shortages are beginning to affect the consultants who are in place.In the survey, 94% complained they were working excessive hours - with more than half saying they were regularly doing more than a fifth extra on top of their contracted time.The report also uncovered a small, but growing problem with consultants emigrating.Last year 21 left the UK compared with three in 2008.College vice president Dr Taj Hassan said: "Senior medical decision-makers in emergency medicine provide one of the most vital strands in maintaining safety."A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis."Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the situation was "unacceptable"."Patients have incredible respect for emergency medicine teams, but those teams need to be backed up with the funding they need to do their jobs without being stretched in this way."A Department of Health spokesman commented: "We know we need to do more to support emergency departments to do their important work through winter and beyond."That is why we are investing £500m and we tasked Health Education England with developing plans to encourage more medical students to become AandE doctors in the future."He also said a major review of the urgent and emergency care system - led by medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh - would be reporting shortly.</body>

They should get out of Kensington and Chelsea, and go to Manchester or Birmingham, and major towns across the country," he said.He said the scheme would help those people to who do not have "piles of cash" for a mortgage deposit.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.HSBC said it would join the scheme later in the year, and Virgin Money said it would offer Help to Buy mortgages from January.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is expected to be up to 0.9% of a property's sale price. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Those who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the Conservative Party conference that the second phase of the scheme would be brought forward by three months from January.A number of lenders have expressed an interest in joining the second phase. Lloyds Banking Group and RBS are the most prominent. Other lenders have yet to commit.Some products from the Halifax and Bank of Scotland will be available from Friday, with deals from other lenders expected to be in place by January.Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September.The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Mr Alexander said the Treasury Committee was right to say that Ministers should keep a close watch on Help to Buy. "We will make adjustments if they (the FPC) recommend them," he said.He also rejected criticism that the government should be tackling a house supply shortage, rather than demand. "All the housebuilders tell us is that what is holding them back (building more houses) is a lack of demand," he said. "There are lots of other policies that this government is doing to tackle demand."Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.</body>

      <title>UK upturn 'is gathering momentum'</title>
      <description>British Chambers of Commerce survey says the UK recovery is gaining pace, while a British Retail Consortium report underlines that some sectors remain fragile.</description>

      <date>1381220184</date>
      <body>UK companies saw sales and optimism jump in the third quarter, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).Service firms saw UK sales and orders rise at the fastest pace since 2007, while the rises for manufacturing were the sharpest since the early 1990s."It's clear that the UK upturn is gathering momentum," said David Kern, BCC chief economist.But a British Retail Consortium survey showed UK retail sales slowed for a second consecutive month in September."These figures are a reality check and will make retailers nervous as we enter the run up to Christmas," said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, which helped compile the BRC data.The British Chambers of Commerce said the results of its quarterly survey mean that it was likely to revise up its GDP forecasts for 2014.The quarterly survey is based based on responses from 7,400 companies, making it the UK's largest business survey.On the basis of the results, the BCC estimates that GDP growth will be in the region of 0.9% and 1% in the third quarter.The survey reported that employment prospects are brighter. A balance of 26% of services firms planned to increase staffing in the next three months, the highest reading since 2007.For manufacturing, the reading was 29%, the highest since the survey began in 1989.The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said in a statement: "It is fantastic to see our small yet dynamic manufacturing sector doing so well, with our results suggesting a recent growth spurt."However, we need to ensure that this does not become an aberration, but rather the norm, particularly when the economic recovery is still facing external risks."He said that levels of investment were still a concern, and that more support was needed for exporters through increased trade promotion and better access to finance."The Government mustn't get distracted, and has to put growth first at all times," Mr Longworth said."We will be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement in the hope that the chancellor uses this opportunity to make a real difference and go all out in the name of growth," he said.Meanwhile, the BRC data showed that like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in floor space as retailers open and close outlets - rose 0.7% in September. This was less than half the rate of growth of the previous two months.Grocery sales showed a weak performance in September, although sales of children's clothing and shoes put in a strong showing, due to the tail-end of the traditional back-to-school spending spree.The BRC said that a slowdown in food and drink sales reflected the tough battleground for market share. And the warm weather had also put people off spending on winter clothes."Consumers are still cautious about spending and are reluctant to restock their wardrobes with winter woollies until the weather cools," Mr McCorquodale said in a statement.The survey underlines that some sectors remain weak, despite a recent run of strong economic data.Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Morrisons and Next, remain cautious about the strength of the UK recovery.</body>

      <title>China warns US to agree debt deal</title>
      <description>A senior Chinese official warns that the "clock is ticking" to avoid a US default that could harm China's economic interests and the global economy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426881</url>
      <date>1381175971</date>
      <body>A senior Chinese official has warned that the "clock is ticking" to avoid a US default that could hurt China's interests and the global economy.China, the US's largest creditor, is "naturally concerned about developments in the US fiscal cliff", vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao said.Washington must agree a deal to raise its borrowing limit by 17 October, or risk being unable to pay its bills.He asked that "the US earnestly take steps to resolve" the issue.US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said that unless Congress agrees an increase in the debt ceiling by 17 October, Washington will be left with about $30bn (£18.6bn) in cash to meet its obligations - about half the $60bn-a-day needed.For many governments and investors the approaching deadlock over the debt ceiling is far more critical than the current impasse over the federal shutdown caused by Congress's failure to agree a new budget.On Sunday Republican House Speaker John Boehner reiterated that Republican lawmakers would not agree to raise the debt ceiling unless it included measures to rein in public spending.Mr Zhu said that China and the US are "inseparable". Beijing is a huge investor in US Treasury bonds."The executive branch of the US government has to take decisive and credible steps to avoid a default on its Treasury bonds," he said."It is important for the US economy as well as the global economy.""We hope the United States fully understands the lessons of history," Mr Zhu said, referring to a similar deadlock in 2011 that led to a downgrade of the US "AAA" credit rating.That deadlock ended with an eleventh-hour agreement.On Monday, President Barack Obama said he would not negotiate with Republicans in the House of Representatives "under the threat of economic catastrophe".He said that he and the Democrats in Congress had already agreed to fund the US government at levels that were favourable to Republicans but lower than preferred by the Democrats.There is little doubt that Mr Boehner could whenever he wants gather enough votes from moderate Republicans and most all Democrats to reopen the government, says Dick Meyer, BBC executive producer, America.Mr Obama called on Mr Boehner to allow his caucus to "vote their conscience" on a bill that would fund the government."If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it," he said, adding he had a "strong suspicion" there would be enough Republicans to join Democrats in the House of Representatives to pass the bill."Let the bill go to the floor and let's see what happens. Just vote."</body>

      <title>Poyet named new Sunderland boss</title>
      <description>Sunderland announce former Brighton boss Gus Poyet as Paolo Di Canio's replacement as head coach at the Stadium of Light.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24441758</url>
      <date>1381221277</date>
      <body>Former Brighton boss Gus Poyet has been named as new Sunderland head coach on a two-year deal.The Black Cats lie bottom of the Premier League and sacked Paolo Di Canio in September after only 13 games.Poyet, 45, who was dismissed by the Seagulls in June, will be joined at the Stadium of Light by his Brighton backroom staff of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway.He becomes Sunderland's sixth manager in the past five years."We analysed a wide range of candidates and believe that Gus's track record, experience, commitment and passion make him the right man to take us forward," said Sunderland chairman Ellis Short.The club's senior professional development coach Kevin Ball had been in temporary charge of the club since Di Canio was relieved of his position following a player revolt at the club.Ball, 48, had asked to be considered for the job, but said following Sunderland's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday he did not expect to be doing another post-match news conference any time soon.Former Chelsea and Tottenham player Poyet, who was capped 26 times by his country, started his coaching career in England in 2006 as assistant to Dennis Wise at Swindon Town then Leeds United.He joined Spurs as first-team coach after one year at Elland Road, later becoming assistant manager to Juande Ramos.In 2009, he was appointed manager at Brighton, leading the south coast club to promotion from League One then taking them to last season's Championship play-off semi-final, where they were beaten by eventual winners Crystal Palace.He was suspended by Brighton in May after an internal investigation and disciplinary hearing and sacked a month later for gross misconduct.The full reasons for his sacking have not been revealed by either party, with Brighton saying the matter would stay confidential "to ensure and maintain confidentiality and dignity" after the former Chelsea midfielder's unsuccessful appeal against his dismissal.He said in August he was taking legal action against Brighton over the decision to dismiss him.Poyet, who has no experience of management in the top flight, made no secret of his interest in the job at the Stadium of Light, and recently said: "I planned that, over the first matches of this season, I would pay a lot of attention to the teams I thought could be in trouble."Of course, I watch Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester, but there was a group of teams who, if they didn't start well, I thought I could have a chance."I was watching Sunderland a lot. People were talking a lot about them in the summer because of Paolo and how many new players they had, so I have seen quite a lot of them."Poyet will be the fourth manager to have worked under owner and chairman Short, since the American businessman assumed 100% control of the club in 2009.Steve Bruce was sacked in November 2011 after two wins in the first 13 league games of that season, before successor Martin O'Neill suffered the same fate last March, with the Black Cats a point above the relegation zone.Di Canio replaced the Northern Irishman and helped Sunderland to wins over Newcastle and Everton, although the side failed to win any of their last three fixtures, finishing the season in 17th.The Italian manager spent £19m in the summer, but was sacked with the club bottom having picked up one point from the first five league games during the 2013-14 campaign.</body>

      <body>Sonny Bill Williams will not feature in New Zealand's defence of the Rugby League World Cup after telling selectors he had "other commitments".The 28-year-old, who helped the Sydney Roosters win Sunday's NRL Grand Final,  is tipped for a return to rugby union.However, four of his Roosters team-mates have been selected, including ex-Hull FC prop Sam Moa.Moa, 27, has eight caps for Tonga, including against Samoa in April, but has opted to switch nationalities.Williams started his career in league, winning an NRL title with the Canterbury Bulldogs before quitting to play rugby union in 2008 and helping the All Blacks win the 2011 World Cup.He made a return to league but is now thought to be pondering a move back to the 15-man code."Sonny is unavailable due to other commitments," said Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney. "What they are at this stage, I'm sure we would all like to know and I'm sure we will hear all about that over the next two or three weeks."Along with Moa, Roosters winger Roger Tuivasa-Sheck has been given a first call-up by coach Stephen Kearney.But club-mate Shaun Kenny-Dowall will miss the tournament because of a fractured jaw he picked up in the Grand Final.Jeremy Smith is absent for personal reasons, while Benji Marshall, so long a key figure in the national team, signed in the summer for rugby union's Auckland Blues.However, ex-Wigan half-back Thomas Leuluai and Greg Eastwood, who had a spell with Leeds in 2010, are both included in the 24-man squad, which will be captained by Simon Mannering.The Kiwis will play the Cook Islands in a warm-up match at Doncaster's Keepmoat Stadium on Sunday, 20 October.They then face group games against Samoa (27 October), France (1 November) and Papua New Guinea (8 November).Meanwhile, Tonga have included three Super League players in their squad with Ukuma Ta'ai from Huddersfield joined by Mickey Paea of Hull KR and St Helens' Willie Manu.The side, captained by Brent Kite, will face Scotland and Italy in Group C.New Zealand: Jesse Bromwich (Melbourne Storm), Greg Eastwood (Canterbury Bulldogs), Kieran Foran (Manly Sea Eagles), Alex Glenn (Brisbane Broncos), Bryson Goodwin (South Sydney Rabbitohs), Tohu Harris (Melbourne Storm), Josh Hoffman (Brisbane Broncos), Krisnan Inu (Canterbury Bulldogs), Shaun Johnson (NZ Warriors), Sam Kasiano (Canterbury Bulldogs), Thomas Leuluai (NZ Warriors), Kevin Locke (NZ Warriors), Issac Luke (South Sydney Rabbitohs), Simon Mannering (NZ Warriors), Ben Matulino (NZ Warriors), Sam Moa (Sydney Roosters), Jason Nightingale (St George Illawarra Dragons), Frank-Paul Nu'uausala (Sydney Roosters), Frank Pritchard (Canterbury Bulldogs), Elijah Taylor (NZ Warriors), Roger Tuivasa-Sheck (Sydney Roosters), Manu Vatuvei (NZ Warriors), Jared Waerea-Hargreaves (Sydney Roosters), Dean Whare (Penrith Panthers).Tonga: Brent Kite (Manly/capt), Sosaia Feki (Cronulla Sharks), Glen Fisi'iahi (NZ Warriors), Mahe Fonua (Melbourne Storm), Daniel Foster (Penrith Panthers), Sydney Havea (Liahona Old Boys), Siliva Havili (NZ Warriors), Konrad Hurrell (NZ Warriors), Samisoni Langi (Sydney Roosters), Siuatonga Likiliki (Newcastle Knights), Sika Manu (Penrith Panthers), Willie Manu (St Helens), Nesiasi Mataitonga (Cronulla Sharks), Fuifui Moimoi (Paramatta Eels), Ben Murdoch-Masila (Wests Tigers), Mickey Paea (Hull KR), Pat Politoni (Cronulla Sharks), Nafe Seluini (Sydney Roosters), Ukuma Ta'ai (Huddersfield Giants), Jorge Taufua (Manly), Jason Taumalolo (North Queensland Cowboys), Peni Terepo (Parramatta Eels), Daniel Tupou (Sydney Roosters), Siosaia Vave (Melbourne Storm).</body>

      <title>Hart receives support from Ruddy</title>
      <description>Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy says Manchester City's Joe Hart deserves to be England's number one goalkeeper.</description>

      <date>1381215378</date>
      <body>Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy says Joe Hart deserves to be England's number one goalkeeper and believes unfair scrutiny of players will affect England's chances of success.Hart, 26, was criticised for his errors in Manchester City's defeats by Cardiff, Aston Villa and Bayern Munich."Joe's the England number one. Rightly so," said Ruddy, one of Hart's two understudies in the England squad."He doesn't warrant that sort of attention. He's a top-drawer keeper."The focus on Hart increased after his mistakes led to two of Bayern's goals in his team's 3-1 Champions League defeat by the reigning champions at Etihad Stadium last week.But England manager Roy Hodgson has said the player is his first-choice goalkeeper for the World Cup qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland, to be played at Wembley on Friday and next Tuesday respectively.Ruddy, who is Hart's rival for the goalkeeping spot along with Fraser Forster, has added his support, admitting he sympathised with Hart."I've been in situations before when people are questioning you. It's never nice," added Ruddy."Without being too patronising, I felt sorry for him."It's the way the media is. You build people up so far and then chop their legs away when they get too high."Unfortunately that's the way the English media goes. Until that stops we might struggle to go anywhere in competitions."Hart's failure to stop routine shots from Bayern's Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben came a few days after he was slow to react for Andreas Weimann's winner in Villa's 3-2 Premier League win.He was also beaten at a corner by Cardiff striker Fraizer Campbell in August and allowed a shot from James Morrison to go underneath him during England's 3-2 victory against Scotland at Wembley in August."Nine times out of 10 when a keeper makes a mistake, the ball goes in the back of the net," said Ruddy."It's a tough world but every keeper is mentally strong enough to deal with that."We're a strange bunch, but you have to be. The self-confidence and self-belief that you have as an individual has to be right up there."</body>

      <title>Lennox calls for pop video ratings</title>
      <description>Pop star Annie Lennox describes modern pop videos as "pornographic", and says they should be subject to a ratings system.</description>

      <date>1381165254</date>
      <body>Pop star Annie Lennox has described the sexualised imagery of modern pop videos as "dark" and "pornographic"."I'm all for freedom of expression," she told BBC Radio 5 live, "but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn.""How do you stop your kids being exposed to it? It's so powerful. You don't want to see your seven-year-old girls twerking all over the place."The singer has called for pop videos to be rated in the same way as films.She previously wrote on her Facebook page that if a pop star created "a soft porn video or highly sexualised live performance, then it needs to qualify as such and be X-rated for adults only".She told 5 live pressure from parents could help to establish "very clear boundaries" on acceptable standards in videos.Her comments fuelled a debate started by Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with singer Robin Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger.That performance, and a similarly risque video for her single Wrecking Ball, prompted Sinead O'Connor to write an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business.Artists such as Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna have also been criticised for explicit performances and costumes in the past.Lennox did not single out any one performer for criticism - referring instead to a "recent spate of overtly sexualised performances and videos" in her Facebook statement."I have nothing against these artists," she told 5 live's Anna Foster. "I was never bashing them."There's nothing wrong with sexuality and sensuality and I think these artists are beautiful. And, in many ways, what they do is fantastic, but it needs to be age-appropriate."These guys have young fan bases and they are being barraged with it."I don't think there's one parent of young boys and girls in this country that would honestly, comfortably say they were fine with seeing their kids being exposed to that kind of thing.""I think this debate is about getting the voice of reason back there to say 'look, we want to protect our kids.'"</body>

      <body>French cinema, opera and theatre director Patrice Chereau, whose work included the acclaimed film La Reine Margot, has died at the age of 68.Elisabeth Tanner, co-director of the Artmedia agency which represented Chereau, confirmed he had died after a long illness.French president Francois Hollande said: "The cultural world is mourning.""France loses an artist... who is its pride across the world," his statement continued.Ms Tanner added: "He had an extraordinary vitality right until the end."The Oscar-nominated La Reine Margot (Queen Margot) won the Cannes Jury prize in 1994.It starred Isabelle Adjani as a young Queen Margot, who found herself trapped in an arranged marriage against the backdrop of a religious war between Catholics and Protestants.Another of his films, Intimacy, won the Berlin Golden Bear best film award in 2001.Starring Mark Rylance, Timothy Spall and Marianne Faithfull, the tale of sexual obsession was based on the book of the same name by Hanif Kureshi.The controversial movie featured explicit sex scenes but Chereau defended it, saying: "It is not like a porno film, not at all erotic sometimes, but it is beautiful because it is life".While revered in his home country for his theatre productions, it was Chereau's production of Wagner's Ring Cycle at the Bayreauth opera festival that attracted international attention.Staged between 1976 and 1980, the production, set in the industrial age, is still seen as a groundbreaking piece.Chereau's assistant on the Ring Cycle, Nicolas Joel, is now the director of the Paris Opera.He said he was "overcome" by the news of Chereau's death."He did me the honour of asking me to go with him to the Bayreauth Festival for the centenary Ring Cycle," he added. "I still have wonderful memories of the time we spent together."</body>

      <title>Viewers complain over Downton plot</title>
      <description>ITV say that 60 people have complained over Sunday's "shocking" episode of Downton Abbey.</description>

      <date>1381216756</date>
      <body>ITV has received 60 complaints over the latest episode of costume drama Downton Abbey, broadcast on Sunday.Viewers took to Twitter to express their "shock" and "distress" after Anna May Bates (Joanne Froggatt) was attacked and raped by a guest's valet.A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes was broadcast before the episode aired.Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has also received a number of complaints - although it cannot yet release figures.An average of 9.2 million viewers watched the episode, with a peak audience of 9.9 million.They saw Anna attacked while the rest of the servants, guests and family were watching an opera performance upstairs.Katy Rink writing in the The Daily Telegraph was one of those shocked at the episode. "Last night we writhed in our sofas, disbelieving and uncomfortable," she said, pointing out that the incident risked alienating viewers who watch Downton for gentle escapism.Viewer Lucy Raine tweeted: "I am genuinely so distressed at what just happened on Downton Abbey I feel sick."While Jennifer Durie tweeted: "I don't think I will ever forgive the writers of Downton Abbey for what they did to Anna."But Nigel Harman, who played attacker Mr Green, said in an interview with ITV's This Morning that the intention was to shock."It was a shocking and bold storyline," he said, adding that when he read the script he was "amazed and excited by it, if that makes sense, because for a show like Downton it really leaped out as a bold and risky idea".He added: "I'd worked with Joanne Froggatt and Brendan Coyle before and we had a rehearsal and went for it. And what we wanted to do was to try and not signal about what was to come."We went for something - as it would be in real life - very shocking."The show has not been afraid to shock viewers in the past, with the unexpected death of key character Matthew Crawley bringing last year's Christmas episode to a sombre conclusion.</body>

      <body>When a young girl starts out in life, where will her journey take her?Will she have the same opportunities as the boys she grows up with? Will she face more dangers, or fight the same battles?More than 100 years since women began winning the right to vote, many societies are still dominated by men.Millions of teenage girls worldwide do not finish school, beginning their childbearing years as their counterparts in the West are beginning to dream of careers and qualifications.Yet the world is a better place for women than ever before. Maternal health is improving, as is access to education. Wages are rising, and women have entered the world's boardrooms.Throughout October, the BBC's 100 Women season will look at the world we live in today through the eyes of the women who make up half the world.Produced by David Botti, Adam Blenford and Fiona Crack</body>

      <title>Escape games attract Hong Kong youth</title>
      <description>How breaking out of rooms is becoming big business</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24424943</url>
      <date>1381187165</date>
      <body>When 27-year-old commercial video producer Danny Ip wants to blow off steam, he does not automatically head to the nearest shopping mall or karaoke joint.Instead the Hong Kong native is fond of frequenting a non-descript office building in the heart of the city's Tsim Sha Tsui neighbourhood.Inside, behind several doors, he can choose to escape to the old American West, a Chinese Wuxia (martial arts) adventure, a gory haunted house or a cartoon wonderland - but only for 45 minutes at a time.Mr Ip is a fan of playing real-life room escape games, the latest trend to catch on with Hong Kong's young, technology-savvy generation."Hong Kong is a busy city. We don't have much time for leisure," he said after a recent game with three of his friends."We always go to the same stuff, like karaoke and bars. It's the same thing over and over again. But this is something new, something different. That is why we enjoy it here."His friend, Ophelia, agrees: "It's very smart and full of imagination. You trap yourself inside a room and you have to use all your brain juice to come out. I think it is fun."The group had just successfully solved a series of puzzles and escaped from cowboy country.In reality, they were playing in a series of three small rooms designed to look like Wild West.It is the physical equivalent of computer games Mr Ip played as a child. But instead of playing alone, you must join forces with at least one other person, solving riddles and breaking codes as a team.The games, in either Chinese or English, are being offered by Freeing Hong Kong, the first company in the city to offer room escape games.It was started less than a year ago by chief executive Raymond Sze and three other partners. They estimate about 100,000 people have played so far.The company now has locations in five Hong Kong neighbourhoods, as well as Taipei, Singapore, Macau and Guangzhou.All the games are created in-house by a team of about three dozen developers led by Mr Sze, who is also a 20-year-old student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (UST).His parents were entrepreneurs, but they did not want the same for their son. Instead, they admonished him to study hard.But Mr Sze, who got his first job at 16, had other ideas. He was dying to start his own business and fulfilled his dream at the age of 19, when Freeing Hong Kong opened."One of the reasons they like to play these games is that it provides a different experience for them. Maybe they want to escape from reality, because you know, reality is very stressful and very competitive," Mr Sze says."It's not because they need to think about their food or their way to live. It is something about society's expectations. They need to achieve so many things."Although Hong Kong is one of the wealthiest cities in Asia, its success has made life difficult for many young people, who struggle to land high-paying jobs to get their foot on the property ladder.The city has some of the most expensive real estate in the world - a recent survey from the Chinese University of Hong Kong suggests salaries are falling far short of property prices.And locals are increasingly competing against ambitious mainland Chinese and Western expatriates for jobs.Mr Sze says he wants to create a healthy outlet for players."You know, Hong Kong people love computer games and actually they lack communication with their friends or their family. In these games, they need to solve the problems and co-operate with each other," he says.The four founders were friends who loved Japanese comics, mysteries and adventure novels.It takes anywhere from a week to three months to come up with a concept. Because they get many repeat players, all the games must be updated or replaced regularly.Mr Sze jokingly calls his school the "University of Stress and Tension", and is currently taking a year off to focus on expanding the firm.He says he had no idea how to set up a company at first. "I Googled everything: how to start a company, how to get a licence, how to get fire insurance," he recalls, laughing.The work seems to have paid off, at least personally."Actually it was very tough for me at the very beginning, but after a few months, when the game became more popular, my parents started to see the media coverage and said, 'Okay, you can take a gap year for this'."</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on select buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the actually matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation…. and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <title>Republican debt limit gambit</title>
      <description>Why some Republicans want the US to breach the debt limit</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24393350</url>
      <date>1381193516</date>
      <body>A faction of the Republican Party believes it cannot lose the battle over raising the US government's borrowing limit - either they dismantle the Democrats' healthcare reform, or the country has to live within its means for a while. But will the rest of the party stick with them?It is a high-stakes gambit - the US has never before breached its authority to borrow money to fund its obligations, and most experts warn it could be catastrophic.But a group of hard-line conservatives in Congress think it is worth the risk.Dozens of Republican politicians, such as Steve King of Iowa, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, have suggested in interviews that the US government could prioritise its payments in the event of a debt limit breach, choosing to fund some government expenses - while drastically cutting others."If you don't raise the debt ceiling, what that means is you have a balanced budget," Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN last week. "It doesn't mean you wouldn't pay your bills."The strategy hinges on convincing President Barack Obama that conservatives are willing to break the debt ceiling and devastate the Democratic Party's government priorities, while assuring Republican big-business backers that this would not destroy the economy.It is a fine line, but conservative grass-roots groups think they have found the silver bullet to kill Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law, which Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana called in typical remarks "the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress".If the debt limit is breached so that "Obamacare" can be destroyed and Americans be taught they can live with less government, so be it."Liberals might be so concerned about settling this issue because they do not want Americans to realize that we can survive just fine with a lot less government spending," Jeffrey Dorfman writes in Forbes. "Perhaps we will be better off in the long run if government gets a little taste of what so many families have been experiencing for years: staying within a budget."First-term Republican Representative Ted Yoho of Florida said in an interview with the Washington Post that hitting the debt limit would "bring stability to the world markets", as it would prove the country is serious about balancing its budget.Without the risk of a sovereign debt default, and with Democratic interests feeling the pain of a predicted 32% cut in overall government spending, the theory goes, Republicans would finally have a negotiating advantage."We hit the debt ceiling, and the world won't end," says Dean Clancy, vice-president of public policy for FreedomWorks, a conservative grassroots activism group."Once the public and Wall Street understand that default is not really a possibility, the president's leverage will be greatly diminished and a bipartisan compromise will be achievable."Other Republicans counter that such a strategy is both impractical and dangerous. Even if the treasury department could figure out how to prioritise payments, the uncertainty created by such an action would devastate financial markets."The issue here is honouring our debt obligations," says Bill Hoagland, a senior vice-president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served as a budget aide to former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist."It's stupid, and it's unbelievable we're even having this conversation."Speaker of the House John Boehner, a reluctant recruit to the current budget fight over healthcare reform, has shown hesitation to take the plunge with the conservative caucus once more.Although he continues to assert that his party is united, there were reports in the media last week that he told nervous colleagues that he would not allow a default on the debt - even if that meant relying on Democratic support to pass a debt limit increase.Civil warAccording to Republican campaign strategist and pollster Matthew Towery, the hard-line conservatives will soon learn their plan is unworkable.As in the economic crisis of 2008, when Congress did not pass an economic rescue bill until the stock market took a 700-point drop, rank-and-file Republicans will turn once the financial markets show signs of stress, he says."The president has blatantly stated that Wall Street should be concerned," Mr Towery says. "He wants a drop, as he knows what that would do. They would have to take immediate action."At that point, enough Republicans would come around to give Mr Boehner cover to bring a debt limit increase to a vote in the House."The [Republican] House majority has a pack mentality until things start to go wrong," Mr Towery says. "Once that happens, Boehner not only will have the votes, he'll probably get a majority of the conference to go along with him."As the debt limit approaches, what has been termed a Republican "civil war" between hard-line conservatives and the party establishment may be approaching its end game.The conservative caucus has proven it is willing to continue to escalate the standoff until it achieves unconditional victory. With strong backing from voters at home and a view the "Obamacare" healthcare reform is an existential threat to the country, compromise is not an option.At some point, however, the rest of the Republican Party may decide it is ready to get off this ride."I think Republicans just want out of this mess altogether," Mr Towery says.</body>

      <title>Marseille battles image as France's murder capital</title>
      <description>Battling Marseille's image as France's murder capital</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24380941</url>
      <date>1381193063</date>
      <body>France's second city, Marseille, has become synonymous with drug-related violence in recent years but local politicians are fighting to change that image.Between the grey high rises of the northern districts, trains pass every few minutes.High-speed rail lines dissect these poorer residential areas, passing bridges and tunnels where gangs of young people smoke, talk and risk falling victim to drugs gangs.It was by the railway tracks that 19-year-old Nabil Badreddine was murdered in March this year, metres from the apartment block where he lived.His murder was one of 15 in the city this year to date.From her flat overlooking the spot his mother, Baya Seddik, explains what happened: "They shot him twice in the back. After they'd shot him they poured petrol all over him and set the car on fire."Nabil was so badly burnt it took days for the police to identify him."Because he had been so badly burnt they tested my DNA - and that's how they found out it was him," his mother says.His killing - still unsolved - was part of a catalogue of crime that has fuelled local contempt for the authorities' inability to stop it.According to police figures, a third of all the murders in France in 2012 took place in the Marseille region.Victims are usually in their late teens and twenties. Many of them are thought to have been caught up in organised crime.Ms Seddik believes her son was innocent. But in a cafe in one of the estates, where a group of men are watching the boxing on TV, one young unemployed man takes a different view."When a guy dies it is not for nothing," he says. "Maybe he's the snitch."The man is a self-confessed drug dealer who claims to know at least 10 people who have been killed."It's not the bad guys who are the drug dealers," he says. "We joke with the cops. We sell drugs. We make money. We don't have problems with the neighbours. Everything, it's good."In spite of a recent spike in the murder rate - there were at least 24 in 2012 and 20 in 2011 - the level of criminality is not as high as it once was.In the early 1960s, as the war for Algeria's independence ended, hundreds of thousands of French people returned from former colonies in North Africa. Many settled in Marseille where new high-rises were built to accommodate them.In the ensuing years the city gained a reputation for its vibrant multiculturalism, as well as for its link in the "French Connection", through which gangs trafficked heroin from Turkey to Europe and on to the United States."The city's geography has a lot to do with its problems," says sociologist Laurent Mucchielli at the University of Aix-Marseille, referring not only to the seaside location, but to social segregation between a poorer north and a richer south."The poorer classes traditionally live in the northern districts… meaning that social barriers have been constructed between north and south."One of the big problems in the northern districts is the school drop-out rate.In 2011, one secondary school - College Vallon des Pins - 15% of its pupils failed to reach their final exams.After a concerted campaign led by its head teacher, Rania Moussaoui, just over 3% of pupils were quitting class before their final exams.When I ask her why the problem existed, she says there was a lack of opportunities outside school for some children: "Perhaps some of my pupils have the sense that they live in a ghetto because they live alone with their mother? Perhaps she has no driving licence and they can't get around town so easily?"We try to make the children aware of their surroundings and make sure they have access to a cultural education."In the run-up to mayoral elections in Marseille next year, opposition parties have taken on the centre-right municipality on issues of social deprivation.Senator and Socialist mayoral candidate Samia Ghali is campaigning for more extra-curricular activities for children in school to help them avoid falling in with the street gangs.The far-right National Front (FN) has also seized on the problem and is campaigning hard. Its leader, Marine Le Pen, described the crime wave as gangrenous, telling a party conference last month that it was "the shape of things to come".Were the anti-immigrant FN to capitalise on the problem in a multi-ethnic city like Marseille it would worry the governing left and the centre-right UMP, which controls the city mayoralty.But Laurent Mucchielli says the Socialist French government is finally coming to understand the problem: "They realise it is one of family breakdown, educational failure and unemployment - not one single cause."He says previous governments have failed to recognise the social factors at root.But the city's UMP mayor, Jean-Claude Gaudin, denies his municipality has failed in its efforts: "When I took over as mayor in 1995, unemployment in this city was 21.6%."Today it is at 13%. I have not stopped lowering the rate. My political vision is for everyone to live together as a community."Outside his grand office by the port, new museums and galleries have opened up - all part of Marseille's year as the European Capital of Culture.It is all a far cry from the north of the city where all the talk is of a lack of investment and unemployment and where, in the stairwell of Baya Seddik's apartment, there is a pungent smell of urine and cannabis."Selling marijuana earns a kid 150 euros [£125; $203] - more than me, more than you," she says."No wonder that the street is robbing us of our kids. You can educate them all you want but they can easily fall into dealing or even killing. We're talking about little kids, you know?"Ms Seddik now campaigns for opportunities for young people in her district.From her apartment, where pictures of Nabil hang on the wall, you can just make out the sound of the trains heading to and from the beating heart of Marseille.</body>

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24369363</url>
      <date>1381193972</date>
      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <body>Seventy years ago this month, an extraordinary mass escape happened from Nazi-occupied Denmark. Tipped off about German plans to deport them to concentration camps, almost the entire Jewish population - several thousand people - fled their homes and left the country.As he stepped onto the fishing boat that was meant to carry them across the Baltic sea to safety, 14-year-old Bent Melchior feared he might never see his home again.A week earlier, he had left the home in Copenhagen he shared with his parents and four siblings. It was 8 October 1943 and Denmark was under Nazi occupation. Along with thousands of other Danish Jews, Bent and his family were fleeing the Germans."We were gathered in this boat that was supposed to carry herrings, but instead it was now carrying human beings," he says.They set off after dark. There were 19 people on the boat, hiding below deck in case German planes should spot them from overhead. The night air was chilly and the sea rough."People started to be sick, and every minute felt like an hour".Melchior and his family were part of a mass escape. That autumn night, 2,500 Jews set sail for neighbouring Sweden from Danish beaches and ports, in rowing boats, canoes, as stowaways on ferries and cargo ships. Some even swam across.In September that year, the Nazi secret police - the Gestapo - had decided to deport all Danish Jews to concentration camps, just as they'd done to millions of other Jews across Europe. The raid was scheduled for Friday 1 October, when they had hoped to find families gathering for the Jewish Sabbath dinner.But when they raided their homes, they found less than 300 people still there.A few days earlier, Georg Duckwitz, a German naval attache working at the German embassy in Copenhagen, had tipped off Hans Hedtoft, a leading member of the Danish Labour party. Hedtoft, who later became Denmark's prime minister, warned the Jewish community to leave."My parents were worried the phone might be tapped. So my mum started ringing other Jewish families, encouraging them to 'take a holiday in the countryside'," Melchior recalls."She told them we were also going away for a few days as we hadn't had a holiday that year."In 1943, Denmark was home to around 8,000 Jews. Although the country had been invaded by Germany three years earlier, the government had accepted the occupation in exchange for a measure of control over domestic affairs. Danish Jews were protected by the Danish government, whose leader collaborated with Hitler.But a determined campaign by the Danish resistance prompted Germany to take over full control of Danish affairs and the government resigned in August. The following month, Hitler ordered the deportation of all Danish Jews.As news of the imminent Nazi raid spread, Melchior's father, a rabbi at Copenhagen's main synagogue, interrupted a service celebrating Jewish New Year to urge the congregation to go into hiding and to spread the word to other Jews.The Melchior family caught a train to the island of Falster in south-eastern Denmark. The carriages were filled with German soldiers and Bent's mother and five-year-old brother Paul travelled in an empty first-class carriage in case the youngest family member unwittingly gave away where they were going.Together with 60 other Jewish refugees, Bent Melchior's father brought his wife and four youngest children into hiding at the home of a bishop. From there, they hoped to flee across the sea to neutral Sweden, which offered safety for refugees.But getting there was not easy. To even secure a place on one of the small fishing boats being used to ferry the Jews across could cost as much as £5,500 ($9,000) a head in today's money.After eight hours at sea, the boat carrying the Melchior family came close to land. Dawn was breaking and a lighthouse was clearly visible. But something was wrong. Having learnt in geography at school that Sweden was east of Denmark, Bent realised that daylight was coming from the wrong direction.In fact, the boat had sailed in a circle rather than east to the Swedish coast. The lighthouse was a Danish lighthouse and the refugees were back where they had set off. The fisherman at the helm had never sailed far from the coast and had no idea how to navigate.Sitting in the comfortable apartment in central Copenhagen he shares with his wife Lilian, surrounded by pictures of their four sons, his recollection of the escape he made 70 years ago is still crystal clear."We were afraid. My five-year-old brother had no idea what was going on. Unbeknownst to me my mother was pregnant at the time, so she had a terrible time," says Bent Melchior."If it was dangerous to be out at sea it night, it was even more dangerous in daylight. We could hear German planes overhead. If they had seen us, the Gestapo would have captured us."Eventually they started to sail east, following the sun. Miraculously, after 18 hours at sea, they reached Lilla Beddinge, a small fishing village on the Swedish coast. A six-year-old boy, Per-Arne Persson, spotted them from the beach and alerted his father, a local fisherman, who sailed out to meet the boat.Bent Melchior and his family settled down to their new life in Sweden. Bent was enrolled in a Danish school in the town of Lund, while his father got a job as a rabbi. But they were now refugees in a foreign country.Swedish was not hard for Danes to understand and the Swedish government had assured them they could stay for the duration of the war. Nevertheless, strangers would often make comments about them."People would complain that we were taking their coffee rations, or whatever was rationed at the time."As refugees we had to queue up to buy second-hand underwear, which they had decided was good enough for us."Seven decades later, Bent can still recall what it was like to be an alien abroad: "All these denigrating signs, I can still feel today," he says.Around 200 people were caught by the Germans while trying to escape and deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic. But more than 7,500 Danish Jews eventually made it across to Sweden in October 1943.They were brought out under cover. Some escape routes were organised by members of the resistance movement. But most Danish historians argue that the escape would not have been possible had it not been for thousands of ordinary Danes who helped the Jews flee.Some were "admitted" to hospitals under false names, others were hidden in churches, farms and holiday homes by the sea while they organised transport.There were of course, exceptions. Eighty Jewish refugees hiding in the loft of a church in the northern town of Gilleleje were arrested by the Gestapo after a young Danish housemaid, engaged to a German soldier, turned them in. They too, were deported to Theresienstadt.After 19 months in Sweden, the German occupation of Denmark was over. Liberation came on 4 May, 1945 and the refugees were free to return home. Melchior and his family moved back into their old apartment in Copenhagen.Life fell back into its usual rhythm, but it was never the same. His experience as a refugee galvanised Bent Melchior to a life-long involvement with refugees."We were changed people. I became very active in various movements within the Jewish community and outside."We tried to take a lesson from what had happened, to stop this terrible intolerance."He later went on to become a senior member of the Danish Refugee Council and followed his father in becoming the chief rabbi of Denmark.He has travelled the world telling his story, determined that this tale of survival should never be forgotten.Per-Arne, the six-year old Swedish boy who spotted their boat from the beach 70 years ago, is still a friend today.Bent Melchior's interview with the BBC World Service programme Witness will be broadcast at 07:50GMT on 8 October.

      <title>Help to Buy costs being unveiled</title>
      <description>Banks begin to unveil details of the mortgages they will offer under the government's expanded Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <date>1381220487</date>
      <body>Banks have begun to unveil mortgages which they will offer under the expanded Help to Buy scheme.The government's initiative is designed to enable buyers who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC and Virgin Money joining later.There have been concerns the scheme could fuel a housing price bubble, but Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander told the BBC that there is no UK price boom."People who think that there's a housing bubble should get out more. They should get out of Kensington and Chelsea, and go to Manchester or Birmingham, and major towns across the country," he said.He said the scheme would help those people to who do not have "piles of cash" for a mortgage deposit.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.HSBC said it would join the scheme later in the year, and Virgin Money said it would offer Help to Buy mortgages from January.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is expected to be up to 0.9% of a property's sale price. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Those who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the Conservative Party conference that the second phase of the scheme would be brought forward by three months from January.A number of lenders have expressed an interest in joining the second phase. Lloyds Banking Group and RBS are the most prominent. Other lenders have yet to commit.Some products from the Halifax and Bank of Scotland will be available from Friday, with deals from other lenders expected to be in place by January.Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September.The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Mr Alexander said the Treasury Committee was right to say that Ministers should keep a close watch on Help to Buy. "We will make adjustments if they (the FPC) recommend them," he said.He also rejected criticism that the government should be tackling a house supply shortage, rather than demand. "All the housebuilders tell us is that what is holding them back (building more houses) is a lack of demand," he said. "There are lots of other policies that this government is doing to tackle demand."Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.</body>

      <title>UK upturn 'is gathering momentum'</title>
      <description>British Chambers of Commerce survey says the UK recovery is gaining pace, while a British Retail Consortium report underlines that some sectors remain fragile.</description>

      <date>1381220184</date>
      <body>UK companies saw sales and optimism jump in the third quarter, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).Service firms saw UK sales and orders rise at the fastest pace since 2007, while the rises for manufacturing were the sharpest since the early 1990s."It's clear that the UK upturn is gathering momentum," said David Kern, BCC chief economist.But a British Retail Consortium survey showed UK retail sales slowed for a second consecutive month in September."These figures are a reality check and will make retailers nervous as we enter the run up to Christmas," said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, which helped compile the BRC data.The British Chambers of Commerce said the results of its quarterly survey mean that it was likely to revise up its GDP forecasts for 2014.The quarterly survey is based based on responses from 7,400 companies, making it the UK's largest business survey.On the basis of the results, the BCC estimates that GDP growth will be in the region of 0.9% and 1% in the third quarter.The survey reported that employment prospects are brighter. A balance of 26% of services firms planned to increase staffing in the next three months, the highest reading since 2007.For manufacturing, the reading was 29%, the highest since the survey began in 1989.The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said in a statement: "It is fantastic to see our small yet dynamic manufacturing sector doing so well, with our results suggesting a recent growth spurt."However, we need to ensure that this does not become an aberration, but rather the norm, particularly when the economic recovery is still facing external risks."He said that levels of investment were still a concern, and that more support was needed for exporters through increased trade promotion and better access to finance."The Government mustn't get distracted, and has to put growth first at all times," Mr Longworth said."We will be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement in the hope that the chancellor uses this opportunity to make a real difference and go all out in the name of growth," he said.Meanwhile, the BRC data showed that like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in floor space as retailers open and close outlets - rose 0.7% in September. This was less than half the rate of growth of the previous two months.Grocery sales showed a weak performance in September, although sales of children's clothing and shoes put in a strong showing, due to the tail-end of the traditional back-to-school spending spree.The BRC said that a slowdown in food and drink sales reflected the tough battleground for market share. And the warm weather had also put people off spending on winter clothes."Consumers are still cautious about spending and are reluctant to restock their wardrobes with winter woollies until the weather cools," Mr McCorquodale said in a statement.The survey underlines that some sectors remain weak, despite a recent run of strong economic data.Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Morrisons and Next, remain cautious about the strength of the UK recovery.</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that new UK coins have been produced to mark a royal christening.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace - just over three months after his birth.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>MPs question economic case for HS2</title>
      <description>A committee of MPs concludes there are serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link will offer value for money.</description>

      <date>1381188013</date>
      <body>A committee of MPs has voiced serious doubts about whether a new high speed rail link would offer the UK value for money.Members of the Treasury Committee said there were "serious shortcomings" in the current cost-benefit analysis for HS2.They said the economic case must be looked at again.A government spokesman said HS2 was vital for the UK to meet its "urgent capacity needs".HS2, which stands for High Speed Two, is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033.The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock.The Committee's report called for a more convincing case for HS2 from the Treasury."We need reassurance that it can deliver the benefits intended and that those benefits are greater than those of other transport schemes - whether in the department's project pipeline or not - which may be foregone," it said.The MPs said the government should formally reassess the project and proceed only once three criteria are met:The government spokesman said the project was on course, under control and would be delivered within the agreed budget."We are confident that our analysis is robust and conforms with government spending guidance," he said."The case for HS2 will be further improved when we publish shortly the updated strategic case - including cost-benefit analysis - which will show high value for money for the project."The HS2 plans have had the backing of all three main political leaders but are strongly opposed by some backbench MPs.However, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has hinted Labour might ditch the project over its cost if the party regains power.A recent report for HS2 Ltd found the project could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service.But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it said.</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>

      <date>1381195653</date>
      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <title>Abenomics 'may take decade' to work</title>
      <description>Japan's aggressive policies aimed at reviving its economy may take 10 years to have a full impact, Japanese minister Akira Amari tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Japan's aggressive policies aimed at reviving its economy may take 10 years to have a full impact, Akira Amari, Japan's minister in charge of economic revitalisation, has told the BBC.Known as Abenomics, these include easing monetary policy, boosting stimulus and reforming key sectors.Some of these steps have already been introduced and have boosted growth.But he warned that while it is easy to implement monetary stimulus measures, scaling them back can be tricky.He told the BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, that Japan's central bank was likely to "learn from the experiences" of the US Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to reduce its key stimulus programme in the coming months."The Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, is experimenting with it," Mr Amari said in an exclusive interview with the BBC."That's why one word from him can move stocks and currencies."Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who came to power in December last year, has made reviving the economy his top priority.He has unveiled a series of aggressive measures to try to achieve that.The measures are based on what are known as the "three arrows" - monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms - to ensure long-term sustainable growth in the world's third-largest economy,The first arrow of monetary policy is aimed at ending Japan's nearly two-decades-long fight with deflation or falling prices.One of the first steps that Mr Abe took was to get Japan's central bank to double its inflation target to 2%. He has even suggested that the bank should print "unlimited yen" to help achieve its inflation target.The second arrow has prompted Mr Abe's government to announce plans to boost government spending on infrastructure, in order to help boost growth further.Mr Amari told the BBC that the steps had already had a positive impact on the Japanese economy.Revised data released last month showed that Japan's economy expanded 0.9% in the April-to-June quarter from the previous three months. That translates into an annualised growth of 3.8%.Meanwhile, consumer prices in Japan have now risen for three months in a row.Mr Amari said that the third arrow - reforming key sectors - was aimed at encouraging private investment in the country, which will aid growth even more.He said that "Abenomics aims to raise total capital investment by 10% within three years", adding that the target was not a difficult one to achieve."It can be achieved in one-and-a-half years. The aim is to replace low productivity facilities with higher productivity ones."However, he added that the government had "dozens of targets" in terms of sectors where it wants to boost investment and "each has its own timeframe, whether it's three or 10 years".He said the government planned to introduce tax incentives, to encourage companies to increase their investment."By increasing investment by 10%, growth will be raised by 1.3%," he added.</body>

      <body>A leading disability charity is calling for a "radical rethink" of government programmes aimed at helping disabled people find paid work.Disability Rights UK, which campaigns for disabled peoples' rights, says the current support programmes are "failing" people with disabilities.It found 63% of those it surveyed said the government support they received did not help them get a job.And it said a majority wanted more say over the nature of the support given."Cutting out the middleman of employment support - under the guise of the Work Programme and Work Choice - provides a better deal to the taxpayer," said Liz Sayce, chief executive of Disability Rights UK.Currently the government has two programmes - The Work Programme and Work Choice - both aimed at helping people with disabilities find paid employment.However, Disability Rights UK said its research of more than 500 disabled people in August, found a mismatch between the support provided and the help disabled job hunters wanted.Overall, 60% of respondents said they would like individualised employment plans, but just 36% of those surveyed had one."The Work Programme is a non-work programme - at best it is heading for an 88% failure rate with people on out of work disability benefits," added Ms Sayce.In its report, Disability Rights UK calls for:A spokesman for the DWP said: "Previous schemes didn't do enough for disabled people and those on sickness benefits, which is why we introduced the Work Programme to give tailored support to address individual barriers to work."Thousands of the most hardest to help people have already found lasting work through the scheme."More generally, we have protected the budget for disability employment services and recently kick-started a two-year advertising campaign to support business to become more confident at recruiting disabled people, as sometimes employer attitudes can be a barrier to work."</body>

      <body>Labour's Chuka Umunna is wrong to say Royal Mail is being sold too cheaply, Business Secretary Vince Cable says.In a letter to the shadow business secretary, Mr Cable says the price was set after "extensive consultation" with investors.His letter follows criticism that the sale price undervalues the business by up to £1bn.Mr Cable warns the criticism is "irresponsible" as it may imply an "easy bargain" is to be had.Earlier on Monday Mr Umunna told the BBC City investors and hedge funds would be the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering and that the sale was "short changing" taxpayers.He said stockbroker Panmure Gordon, which valued the business at £4.5bn, well above the government's top end price band of £3.3bn, was only one voice.In his letter, Mr Cable dismisses in detail many of Mr Umunna's criticisms and says that the price reflects the fact the business brings risks, as well as assets such as property.He says: "It is irresponsible to imply that a share offering looks significantly undervalued."I think you should consider the risk that you may be influencing the decisions of retail investors. Equity investment always involves risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there is an easy bargain to be made."Demand for the shares has been strong.On Friday, it was reported it was outstripping supply and they were to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested price range.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares were a "few times" the value of those on offer.Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the brokers through which investors can buy shares, said it would stay open until midnight on Tuesday to cope with the expected high demand.Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.Up to 62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds."The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares is very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold at between 300-330p.Members of the Communication Workers Union are being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.John Glen, senior lecturer in economics at the Cranfield School of Management suggested demand was being driven by a government guarantee of a £130m profit to shareholders next July, meaning shareholders would get a 6.5% return on their shares,."(It) is a good return given what you get if you put your money in the bank at the moment," he told BBC Breakfast.However, he noted that the privatisation was controversial. "Over the last six years, we the taxpayers have spent about £2.75bn making the Royal Mail more profitable, we've taken on £8bn of pension liabilities and of course there's the issue about whether or not the Royal Mail will guarantee to deliver to us every day, across the whole country, at a single price."</body>

      <title>Thousands miss child benefit cut-off</title>
      <description>An estimated 165,000 people have missed a deadline to register with the UK tax authority over their collection of child benefit.</description>

      <date>1381153938</date>
      <body>An estimated 165,000 people have missed a deadline to register with the UK tax authority over their collection of child benefit.Better-off families need to sign up for self-assessment with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if they continue to receive the benefit, or face a penalty.Some 29,000 people registered in the final hours before a deadline at the end of Saturday,HMRC said those who remained could still complete the paperwork.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They are losing some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning a taxable income of between £50,000 and £60,000. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.The amount of benefit they are not entitled to is clawed back by HMRC through the tax system, which is why they need to complete a tax return by 31 October, if it is on paper, or by 31 January online.On Friday, Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, said that thousands of people needed to "get off their backsides" and register by the end of Saturday.On Monday, a spokesman for the tax authority said: "On past experience we expect more people to register in the coming days. Although we are past the deadline, people should still register for self-assessment to minimise any penalties they may face."The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid, in addition to refunding the appropriate amount. In practice, it is expected that anyone who signs up and pays the tax due by 31 January will not receive a penalty.</body>

      <title>'Increased risk' of winter blackouts</title>
      <description>The risk of blackouts this winter will be higher than at any time over the past six years, according to the National Grid.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24433778</url>
      <date>1381165669</date>
      <body>The risk of blackouts this winter is higher than at any time over the past six years, National Grid has said.The operator of the UK's electricity network said the difference between the power being generated and estimated peak demand could fall to levels not seen since the winter of 2007-08.However National Grid said it was "comfortable" with the margin."As long as the market responds in the way that it has done historically then we will be absolutely fine", it added.As a result of the tight margin, National Grid said it expected to have to issue more warnings to the market to encourage energy firms to bring on extra supplies.The number of coal-based power plants operating across the UK has fallen sharply over the past year due to the effects of EU legislation which has caused older polluting coal and oil power plants to be turned off.The situation has been exacerbated as some gas fired plants have also been mothballed due to economic pressures.Chris Train, director of market operations at National Grid, said despite the series of power station closures since last year, it was still confident the market could meet demand, even in the event of another prolonged cold spell such as in March this year."As the system operator, we're never complacent. It's up to us to be ready to balance the system in real time. We believe we are ready and have the tools we need to play our part," he added.In June, energy regulator Ofgem said that risks to security of electricity supply - the danger of the lights not being kept on - had increased due to the UK's shortage of power stations and new wind farms.It also warned that the risk of electricity customer disconnections would "appreciably increase" albeit from near-zero levels.Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents energy companies, said the tight margin between supply and demand demonstrated investment was "urgently needed"."This is not scaremongering. What we need right now is clear, pragmatic energy policy to keep energy affordable, long-term certainty to attract vital investment and the necessary back-up to ensure we have energy security when and where it's needed."A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it would work closely with both National Grid and the energy industry to monitor energy supplies through the winter."Our infrastructure has the capacity to deliver over twice average winter demand for gas, and has coped well with recent extreme winter conditions," he added.</body>

      <title>China warns US to agree debt deal</title>
      <description>A senior Chinese official warns that the "clock is ticking" to avoid a US default that could harm China's economic interests and the global economy.</description>

      <date>1381175971</date>
      <body>A senior Chinese official has warned that the "clock is ticking" to avoid a US default that could hurt China's interests and the global economy.China, the US's largest creditor, is "naturally concerned about developments in the US fiscal cliff", vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao said.Washington must agree a deal to raise its borrowing limit by 17 October, or risk being unable to pay its bills.He asked that "the US earnestly take steps to resolve" the issue.US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said that unless Congress agrees an increase in the debt ceiling by 17 October, Washington will be left with about $30bn (£18.6bn) in cash to meet its obligations - about half the $60bn-a-day needed.For many governments and investors the approaching deadlock over the debt ceiling is far more critical than the current impasse over the federal shutdown caused by Congress's failure to agree a new budget.On Sunday Republican House Speaker John Boehner reiterated that Republican lawmakers would not agree to raise the debt ceiling unless it included measures to rein in public spending.Mr Zhu said that China and the US are "inseparable". Beijing is a huge investor in US Treasury bonds."The executive branch of the US government has to take decisive and credible steps to avoid a default on its Treasury bonds," he said."It is important for the US economy as well as the global economy.""We hope the United States fully understands the lessons of history," Mr Zhu said, referring to a similar deadlock in 2011 that led to a downgrade of the US "AAA" credit rating.That deadlock ended with an eleventh-hour agreement.On Monday, President Barack Obama said he would not negotiate with Republicans in the House of Representatives "under the threat of economic catastrophe".He said that he and the Democrats in Congress had already agreed to fund the US government at levels that were favourable to Republicans but lower than preferred by the Democrats.There is little doubt that Mr Boehner could whenever he wants gather enough votes from moderate Republicans and most all Democrats to reopen the government, says Dick Meyer, BBC executive producer, America.Mr Obama called on Mr Boehner to allow his caucus to "vote their conscience" on a bill that would fund the government."If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it," he said, adding he had a "strong suspicion" there would be enough Republicans to join Democrats in the House of Representatives to pass the bill."Let the bill go to the floor and let's see what happens. Just vote."</body>

      <title>Extra runway capacity 'needed'</title>
      <description>The south-east of England will need more runway capacity in the years to come, the head of the Airports Commission says.</description>

      <date>1381154431</date>
      <body>The south-east of England will need more runway capacity in the years to come, the head of the Airports Commission has said.In a speech, Sir Howard Davies set out the commission's "developing views" on the UK's future airport capacity needs.He said the "provisional conclusion" was that extra runway capacity would be needed in the South East over the coming decades.To rely on existing runways would lead to "a distinctly sub-optimal solution".In a speech, Sir Howard said the demands on the UK's busiest airports were likely to continue to grow "even if we take a more conservative view of future aviation demand than the Department for Transport has in the past".He said that the commission thought it was difficult to see how the free market alone could resolve the capacity-demand imbalance in the South East.Regional airports are already serving their local markets effectively but it is difficult to see how they can absorb all the excess demand, he said."Taken together, these considerations point to the need for new runway infrastructure in the south-east of England in the coming decades," he said.The Airports Commission was launched on 2 November last year, with the aim that it should produce a full and final report no later the summer of 2015, which would be after the next general election.Sir Howard, a former director general of the CBI and ex-head of the Financial Services Authority, said: "Our final conclusions will certainly not please everyone. I am sure about that."Labour had approved an extra, third runway at Heathrow airport, but this plan was abandoned by the coalition Government when it took power in May 2010.Since then, the debate about airport capacity has continued, with Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposing a new airport, while other people have called for expansion at either Stansted or Gatwick.</body>

      <title>Kate Moss in new Topshop tie-up</title>

      <date>1381149963</date>
      <body>The model Kate Moss is to return to Topshop for a new collaboration, three and a half years since her last collection for the high street brand.The first instalment of the clothing line will be released in shops in April 2014.Kate Moss's partnership with Topshop, owned by retailer Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, first began in May 2007, and ended in 2010.The new range will be sold in 40 countries.Kate Moss, one of the world's most successful and recognised models, has recently been involved with other product ranges for brands such as accessories company Longchamp and Carphone Warehouse.Danielle Pinnington, managing director of shopper research agency, Shoppercentric said that she hadn't predicted this latest collaboration, but it had proved successful the first time around."It did go well before, especially at the start - but that's because it was breaking new ground, and there was a huge marketing push behind it. Whether it can have the same impact again, I would question".Ms Pinnington added that celebrity link-ups with retailers are now all over the high street."There are an awful lot of these celebrity collaborations now across the fashion sector."But, she says, Kate Moss still has a "fast fashion and broad" appeal.In June of this year Topshop opened for the first time in Hong Kong, despite the city's high commercial rents.As the area's retail hub, traditionally tourists from mainland China have flocked to Hong Kong for shopping trips.The move into Hong Kong was helped by Sir Philip Green selling a 25% stake in his Topshop and Topman chains in late 2012 to a US private equity group, Leonard Green and Partners. The deal valued the two brands at £2bn.Some of the money from this sale was used to pay off company debt, while the rest was used to help pave the way for expansion plans.The Arcadia Group, which employs 45,000 people, was taken over by Sir Philip Green in 2002. It includes other high street names such as Miss Selfridge and BHS.</body>

      <body>The property developer, Gary McCausland, has emerged as the buyer of top golfer Rory McIlroy's former home in County Down.The golfer sold Robinhall House earlier this year as he moved his base to Florida.Mr McCausland said the house, which has extensive golf practice areas on its 14-acre grounds, was "an amazing place".He said the golfing facilities made it unlike anything else in the world.The asking price for the house at Moneyreagh was £2m, but it is understood that Mr McCausland paid less than that.Mr McIlroy's new home is a £6.5m riverside mansion in Palm Beach.It is believed that on trips back to Northern Ireland, he has used the practice grounds at his old house.Last month, it emerged that London-based Mr McCausland had bought a Belfast city centre development site that was formerly owned by the failed Patton construction group.Mr McCausland, who is originally from Dungannon, County Tyrone, is planning to develop an apartment scheme on the Dublin Road site.He said it was his first significant investment in Belfast and that he was keen to do "plenty more" if the business environment was supportive.</body>

      <title>Russia bars Lithuania dairy produce</title>
      <description>Russia halts imports of Lithuanian dairy produce amid tensions over EU plans to forge closer ties with ex-Soviet republics.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24433418</url>
      <date>1381167473</date>
      <body>Russia has halted imports of Lithuanian dairy produce amid tensions over EU plans to forge closer ties with ex-Soviet republics.Russia's consumer watchdog said the levels of yeast and mould in Lithuanian dairy produce were unacceptable.Lithuania is already involved in a bitter dispute with Russia over the cost of Russian gas, which Moscow's former Soviet bloc allies rely on.Lithuania is leading EU efforts to sign new trade deals with those countries.Russia's consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor has previously imposed various bans on food and drink imported from former Soviet neighbours, for example on wine from Georgia and Moldova, citing health concerns. In July Russia halted imports of chocolate from the big Ukrainian firm Roshen.Such actions have been widely seen as Russia using trade to put political pressure on its neighbours.In recent weeks Russian customs officers have imposed time-consuming checks on Lithuanian lorries on the Russian border, leading to long delays and queues.Last week Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius warned that Vilnius could retaliate on the border with Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave surrounded by Lithuania and Poland. The city of Kaliningrad is a major port on the Baltic.Speaking to Reuters news agency, Mr Linkevicius said: "The Kaliningrad region is isolated, geographically isolated, so we could apply some measures also to cut something"."We could cut off trains, but not only trains, also the supply of goods, whatever. It is theoretically possible. It was not discussed, it's not our way of thinking, it's not our methods," he said.The European Commission is investigating Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom over alleged market-rigging in Eastern Europe. Last week Lithuania's Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said that in 2006-2012 the cost of Russian gas had soared by 600%, seriously undermining Lithuania's competitiveness.Russia is a major export market for Lithuanian dairy produce, the bulk of which is cheese, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reports. In 2012 Lithuania exported 370,000 tonnes of dairy produce to Russia, worth $193m (£120m).The Russian market also accounts for almost 85% of all Lithuanian exports, Itar-Tass reports.The EU and Ukraine are preparing an association agreement, with plans to sign it in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in late November. Such agreements, along with a free trade partnership, are seen as key steps towards eventual EU membership.Moldova and Georgia - also former Soviet republics - may initial association agreements with the EU.Russia has been urging former Soviet republics to join a Russian-led customs union, and Armenia recently said it would do so. The EU had been expecting Armenia to sign an association agreement, and told Yerevan that it could not join both trade blocs.Only Belarus and Kazakhstan have joined Russia in the customs union so far, which Russian President Vladimir Putin sees as a step towards a "Eurasian union".</body>

      <body>Bank card fraudsters have targeted Surrey residents in a series of attempted thefts over a period of 24 hours, police said.Ten reports of attempted scams were reported to police, with the latest three calls received just after 21:00 BST on Saturday.The fraudsters phone people claiming to be a police officer and try to get them to hand over cash and cards.Attempted thefts happened in Guildford, Woking, Pyrford, Burpham and Chobham.The callers use a variety of stories including saying the person's bank card has been used by somebody they have in custody.They then ask the card holder to phone the bank to cancel the card and say they will send a courier round to collect it.The fraudster stays on the line and obtains the person's bank details whilst they think they are phoning the bank.A courier then visits the victim's home, saying they have been sent by the police to collect the card.The latest calls were received in Upshot Lane, Woking; Frog Grove Lane, Wood Street Village and Burnet Avenue, Burpham.An attempt was also made in Boltons Lane, Pyrford at about 17:30 BST, when a man claiming to be a courier attempted to get bank cards from an elderly resident.He is described as white, aged about 40, 5ft 8in (1.7m) tall and spoke with an eastern European accent. He was stocky, with short dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket and trousers.Officers have urged anyone who receives a suspicious call not give away any details and to call the police.</body>

      <date>1380883609</date>
      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <body>The man behind a phone scam targeting the unemployed has been fined £75,000 by the regulator PhonepayPlus.Jobseekers were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.In the ruling, the regulator said the numbers were run by sole trader John Francis, from Epsom, and cost callers a least 50p a minute. Some spent more than £80 enquiring about jobs.The regulator said the trick gave false hope to vulnerable people.Jobseeker Karl Lever told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours he was charged £40 after he responded to an advert for bar staff in Brighton.In his hour-long phone call he was asked about his suitability for the role, previous experience and even his medical history."In hindsight it did feel like they were trying to keep me on the phone for as long as possible," he said.In a statement, PhonepayPlus said: "When it received these complaints PhonepayPlus launched an investigation and found that they were linked. It then identified John Francis, registered as a sole trader, as the person responsible for the service."As well as the £75,000 fine, he has been ordered to refund all those affected.Paul Whiteing, PhonepayPlus chief executive, told You and Yours: "He has seven days to pay and if he doesn't we will pursue him through the courts."They look like conventional mobile phone numbers, therefore many people don't realise what they are - so something should be done about that."It's unacceptable."None of the callers were told about the cost of the calls and most believed they were calling a mobile number. But the 070 numbers cost at least 50p a minute and those running the lines take a cut.PhonepayPlus acknowledge that it can be confusing and said they were working with Ofcom, which allocates phone numbers, and are reviewing the use of these numbers.The regulator also found the same numbers used for bogus jobs on adverts for cheap housing and in spam emails sent out offering work.One complainant told the regulator about spending an hour on the phone trying to arrange an interview. After complaining about the delay, the complainant was told: "You'll be even less happy when you get the bill."John Francis has seven days to pay the fine, otherwise further action will be taken. He did not respond to the regulator.</body>

      <title>World Bank cuts East Asia outlook</title>
      <description>The World Bank cuts its 2013 economic growth forecast for East Asia's developing countries, citing China's slowdown and the expected end to US stimulus measures.</description>

      <date>1381142093</date>
      <body>The World Bank has cut its growth forecast for East Asia's developing countries from 7.8% to 7.1% for 2013.The international lender said that a slowdown in China's growth and the prospect of the end of US stimulus measures would affect growth in the region's economies.China's economy is expected to grow by 7.5%, lower than the 8.3% prediction made in April this year.Lower commodity prices have also weakened prospects, the bank said.Last week, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cut its outlook for the region, also citing slower growth in China as a reason.The ABD and the World Bank both said the much anticipated future scaling down of the $85bn-a-month stimulus programme in the US was a cause for concern.The World Bank's chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific, Bert Hofman, said: "It will mean an increase of global interest rates for which countries would need to prepare. And they need to prepare for potential financial market volatility in the process."However, he said that the delay in the Federal Reserve's decision to begin the unwinding, or tapering, of its stimulus programme had brought one benefit."In a way, the talk of tapering in July and August was sort of a very nice general rehearsal for the actual thing".Headwinds and tailwindsHowever, Mr Hofman noted that, while there were causes for concern, the region was still growing."We are seeing a slowdown in domestic demand, which is a headwind, but at the same time Asia is seeing a tailwind from the revival of the rest of the global economy," he said.The World Bank said the slowdown in Chinese growth was a result of the country shifting its export-dominated economy to one where domestic demand plays a greater role.Countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia will see slower expansion because of lower global commodity prices, slower exports and reductions in investment.Excluding China, the World Bank predicts that the economy of the East Asian region will grow by 5.2% in 2013 and 5.3% in 2014, slower than the 6.2% growth for 2012.</body>

      <title>UK services growth at 16-year high</title>

      <body>Activity in the UK services sector grew at its fastest pace since 1997 in the third quarter of the year, a closely-watched survey has indicated.The Markit/CIPS PMI services index said the rise was due to growth in financial services, bolstered by the housing market, and the business sector.The survey raises hopes that the economy as a whole saw strong growth in the July-to-September period.The PMI survey showed services continued to grow strongly last month.The activity index for the sector recorded 60.3 in September, which was marginally down from August's near seven-year high of 60.5. Any score above 50 indicates growth.The strong reading for the UK services sector follows similarly strong surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors published earlier this week.David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: "After nearly six lost years of economic output, the UK economy looks to have really found its feet."He said the survey reflected the stability in the global economy, which the services sector was taking "full advantage of"."The industry sustained August's impressive business growth, dipping only fractionally from a near seven-year high, and new orders have now been growing for nine months consecutively," Mr Noble added.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said there were "encouraging signs" that growth would continue in the coming months."September saw one of the largest inflows of new business ever seen by the services survey," he said.</body>

      <body>House prices are rising at their highest annual pace for more than three years, the Halifax says, as demand for properties continues to rise.Prices in the three months to September were 6.2% higher than a year earlier, the highest rate since June 2010.Prices rose by 0.3% in September compared with the month before, taking the average house price to £170,733.However, the average price of a home still remains 14% below the peak reached in August 2007.Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices rose at an annual pace of 5% in September.The Halifax said demand for property was rising thanks to low interest rates and improving consumer confidence.It added that government schemes - such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy - also appeared to have increased demand for housing.The recovery in property prices over the past few months has led to concerns that the market could be in danger of overheating.However, others note that prices and activity still remain well below levels seen before the financial crisis, and that the rise in prices has been centred around London and the South East.The Halifax added there were signs that more properties were starting to come on to the market, which could begin to slow price increases."The recent strengthening in house prices is increasing the amount of equity that many homeowners have in their home, enabling more to put their property on the market for sale," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax.The Halifax also noted that levels of housebuilding were starting to increase.On Wednesday, a survey of the UK's construction sector suggested that housebuilding activity grew last month at its fastest pace for almost a decade,</body>

      <title>The drink of kings makes a comeback</title>
      <description>Mead, the stuff of kings and Renaissance fairs, is growing in popularity again in the US, as the BBC's Kim Gittleson reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24184527</url>
      <date>1380755618</date>
      <body>Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe."Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel."If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works," he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge."We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day," explains Mr Alexander.It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead."It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages," he gushes.After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade."We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years," she says."I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead "is becoming more and more available - similar to cider".Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments."I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is," says Mr Alexander."You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed."People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet," says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.This means that mead has to be labelled as "honey wine", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet."How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?" says Ms Rowe.Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire."I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it," says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan."Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'" he says.After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was "kind of an untouched category", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning."If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%," says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander."So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage."You've got a canvas with very few limits."</body>

      <title>Pioneer woman in Sri Lankan business</title>
      <description>Nimali Gunawardana is a 25-year-old Sri Lankan proving that young women can succeed in the country's male-dominated business world.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24206038</url>
      <date>1380496667</date>
      <body>Nimali Gunawardana, a petite, soft-spoken 25-year-old, is a lot tougher than she looks.From an impoverished upbringing as one of seven children in a poor family in rural Sri Lanka, she has turned herself through sheer drive and determination into one of the country's most up-and-coming young businesswomen.Able to recover from one serious business setback along the way, the self-made boss and her company - Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill - are now continuing to prosper in Sri Lanka's male-dominated business community.And Ms Gunawardana now has her sights set on exporting."I am happy that I have broken down the barriers a woman has to face in Sri Lankan society," she says."I've always had ambition, and I want to get to the top."Ms Gunawardana's company turns discarded coconut husks into three useful materials - coir, coir pith and husk chips.Coir is the fibrous outer cover of the coconut. It can be made into everything from string and rope to fishing nets, brushes and mattresses.Coir pith, one layer down, has a cork-like texture, and is used as a compost. Husk chips, made by crushing up the hard part of coconut shells, are also used as a growing material for plants, and even to filter water.Ms Gunawardana set up the company just over a year ago, and it now processes 15,000 coconuts a day.The business, based in the southern rural district of Ambalantota, employs 13 people - 11 women and two men.For Ms Gunawardana it is a far cry from her first job working as a sewing machine operator in a clothing factory.She says: "My parents are poor, and when I was at school I always wanted more money for the family."So I had to earn money, and I got a job at a garment factory. I didn't like it, I didn't like the supervisors always blaming you, I didn't like working for someone else, but I was able to save up money."I knew I wanted to save up the money to establish my own business."And so, using cash she had saved and money invested by some of her friends, she bought the lease for a coir-producing factory in 2010.Unfortunately she soon realised she did not have the experience to run a company. More pressingly, she was unaware that the business had a number of outstanding loans.As a result, she had to close down the company, losing 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($2,300; £1,400).Many people would have given up the dream of owning their own business, but Ms Gunawardana was determined to bounce back.After the company failure, no bank would lend to her, so she went to Youth Business Sri Lanka, a business support organisation that is part of Youth Business International, the global charity run by the Prince of Wales.Youth Business gave her a week's training in running a company, her own mentor, and a modest loan of 100,000 Sri Lankan rupees.And so her new company, Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill, was born in August last year, and is proving a success.Ms Gunawardana says she is on target for turnover this year of 5.1m Sri Lankan rupees ($39,000), and she is able to pay back the money lent by her friends.She says: "When I first started out in business, my parents did not agree with my choice, mainly because I am a girl. In rural parts of Sri Lanka, women like me are very rare."But now my parents are proud, and they give me their support, as does my husband."Ms Gunawardana has now been married for nine months, and her husband quit his job to work for her.Such has been the success of her new company that Youth Business International recently awarded her the global title of Start-up Entrepreneur of the Year 2013.Ms Gunawardana travelled to London this month to receive the award from the Prince of Wales.She now has her eyes on expanding the business.Ms Gunawardana currently sells her products to other companies who then export them. She wants to start doing the exporting herself. She also plans to start making products from what she produces, with her company starting to turn its coir into rope."I have faced a lot of challenges, but I have also had help from Youth Business. I hope that more young women in Sri Lanka think of starting their own companies."</body>

      <title>Putting the best foot forward</title>
      <description>The BBC's Jennifer Pak speaks to Lew Fong Voon about his passion for shoe design and how he came to create his own brand in Malaysia.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24330094</url>
      <date>1380668759</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Jennifer Pak spoke to Lew Fong Voon (now known as Lewre Lew) about discovering his passion for shoe design while working in a manufacturers and how, despite initial obstacles, he came to create his own brand.In 1991, Lew Fong Voon thought he had a big break when his shoe trading company was chosen as one of nine businesses to represent Malaysia at an international exhibition.He gathered all of the best designs sourced from Malaysian factories because he said that the GDS fair in Germany was "like the Olympics" of the shoe industry.But nobody looked at his collection.People had no idea where Malaysia was or how to even pronounce the name of the country, said Mr Lew."It was very discouraging and at the same time humiliating," he said.Mr Lew did not get any business that year or the next two years after that but he continued to show up at the annual international shoe fair even when the other Malaysian companies had given up.He believed Malaysia had very good shoe craftsmen but didn't have updated designs. Bringing back ideas from the fair, he aimed to change this.In the fourth year, two customers finally ordered a thousand pairs of shoes from Mr Lew. The small shipment helped launch his overseas business.Over the next decade he produced shoes for international labels, but there was a slow push in the country to not only rely on natural resources and cheap manufacturing.Mr Lew was inspired to work on his own brand after he met fellow Malaysian designer Jimmy Choo.He produced his mid-priced collection under the name Lewre, a loose combination of his surname and the name of his first company, Roondy, in 1997 at the start of the Asian financial crisis.The venture was risky but it also meant that production costs became cheaper, he says.Mr Lew's company weathered the financial crisis. He attributes this to the fact that his childhood prepared him for the tough battle. He was one of ten children in his family. Food was a struggle. At eight years old, he started working at a plantation in northern Perak state, tapping rubber trees before dawn to help make ends meet for his family.Mr Lew 's commute to work required him to walk across terrain filled with snakes and the sounds of tigers growling nearby."It was full of challenges [and] I think full of fun," he said.Today, Mr Lew has exchanged the jungle for a spacious office on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and has expanded his brand to more than 20 countries.He turned an initial capital investment of RM50,000 ($15,000; £10,000) in shoe manufacturing in the late 1980s into a company whose revenue is expected to reach $25m (£15.5m) in three years' time.At the Lewre headquarters in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, middle-aged women sit in the back of the workshop sewing each bead onto a satin heel.Mint-green shoe moulds belonging to affluent women, including actress Michelle Yeoh and the Duchess of Cambridge, hang in the backroom.The recent global downturn has not slowed down Mr Lew's expansion plans. He is set to open a couture shop in London and the company has invested millions to develop several new sub-brands.Mr Lew describes his designs as "fashion forward". He wants to prove that Asian brands can produce quality products that appeal to a global audience.His future projects could make even more customers take notice - Mr Lew has considered designing high-heel shoes for men.It was normal for women to wear 4-5in (10-13cm) heels now, so as our women got taller so the men needed to "catch up," said Mr Lew.</body>

      <body>Rangers chief executive Craig Mather and finance director Brian Stockbridge have held discussions in South Africa with Dave King over the club's future.King invested heavily during Sir David Murray's Ibrox reign and maintained interest during recent club events.But issues with South African tax authorities prevented him from playing a more significant role.King recently agreed to pay almost £44m to the Revenue Service as criminal charges against him were dropped.A spokesman for the Rangers board told BBC Scotland: "Craig Mather and Brian Stockbridge have been meeting a number of investors."Craig is returning from South Africa tonight (Monday) and has also been in Dubai. Brian was in South Africa last week."King did not wish to comment when contacted by BBC Scotland.He has, however, spoken in recent weeks of his desire to invest in Rangers.The Glasgow-born businessman has been a fierce critic of both Charles Green, who led a purchase of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club Plc, and Craig Whyte, whose ownership ended with that company going into administration and then liquidation.You can follow Alasdair on Twitter: @BBCAlLamont </body>

      <title>Giro will be 'biggest ever NI event'</title>
      <description>NI Tourism Minister Arlene Foster says that three days of Giro d'Italia action is a huge opportunity for the province.</description>

      <date>1381174017</date>
      <body>Northern Ireland Tourism Minister Arlene Foster has said that the three days of Giro d'Italia action in the province will make for the "biggest event" ever staged in Northern Ireland.The 2014 race will start in Belfast on 9 May and the Minister said the Giro will give Northern Ireland "a global outreach we have never had before"."This is going to be even bigger than this year's G8," insisted the Minister."We expect around 150,000 people to come to Northern Ireland for the race."The Northern Ireland Minister attended Monday's launch of the Giro in Milan.Last week, the event appeared to be plunged into crisis when news emerged that Giro race director Michele Acquarone had been suspended from his role as chief operating officer at the company that organises the Giro, RCS Sport.This followed a revelation earlier last week that up to £11m was missing from the firm's books.The Northern Ireland Executive is understood to be spending over £3m to bring the race to the province.Following last week's disclosure, RCS Sport appointed a new chief executive Riccardo Taranto and he insisted on Monday that next year's event is totally secure."We have never put in any jeopardy the RCS Sport's abilities," said Taranto, who is leading the internal investigation into the apparent missing money."We are not concerned. We are working to fix these issues and of course there is an investigation."Irish cyclist Nicolas Roche, whose father Stephen won the Giro in 1987, insisted that next year's event would be "something great"."There are about 7,500 people working every day on the event and it's like a little village moving about. There will be loads of things going on. It's a lot more than a cycling race," added Roche.The race begins on Friday 9 May with three stages in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.As revealed by BBC Northern Ireland last week, the opening 21.7km team time trial will begin at Titanic Belfast - the visitor centre at the site of the famous ship's construction.The 218km Saturday leg starts in Belfast and goes to Antrim, Ballymena, Bushmills and the Giant's Causeway, taking in the coastline from Cushendall to Larne on to Whitehead and Carrickfergus before returning to Belfast.The final stage of the Ireland leg, on Sunday 11 May, will see the riders embark on a 187km cross-border section from Armagh to Dublin.The riders will then have a rest day before the Italian section of the race begins in Giovinazzo on the Adriatic coast on 13 May.The race, won this year by Italian Vincenzo Nibali, will also mark the 10th anniversary of Italian rider Marco Pantani's death, with several stages dedicated to the climber who won both the Giro and the Tour de France in 1998 but died from cocaine poisoning in 2004.</body>

      <title>Escape games attract Hong Kong youth</title>
      <description>How breaking out of rooms is becoming big business</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24424943</url>
      <date>1381187165</date>
      <body>When 27-year-old commercial video producer Danny Ip wants to blow off steam, he does not automatically head to the nearest shopping mall or karaoke joint.Instead the Hong Kong native is fond of frequenting a non-descript office building in the heart of the city's Tsim Sha Tsui neighbourhood.Inside, behind several doors, he can choose to escape to the old American West, a Chinese Wuxia (martial arts) adventure, a gory haunted house or a cartoon wonderland - but only for 45 minutes at a time.Mr Ip is a fan of playing real-life room escape games, the latest trend to catch on with Hong Kong's young, technology-savvy generation."Hong Kong is a busy city. We don't have much time for leisure," he said after a recent game with three of his friends."We always go to the same stuff, like karaoke and bars. It's the same thing over and over again. But this is something new, something different. That is why we enjoy it here."His friend, Ophelia, agrees: "It's very smart and full of imagination. You trap yourself inside a room and you have to use all your brain juice to come out. I think it is fun."The group had just successfully solved a series of puzzles and escaped from cowboy country.In reality, they were playing in a series of three small rooms designed to look like Wild West.It is the physical equivalent of computer games Mr Ip played as a child. But instead of playing alone, you must join forces with at least one other person, solving riddles and breaking codes as a team.The games, in either Chinese or English, are being offered by Freeing Hong Kong, the first company in the city to offer room escape games.It was started less than a year ago by chief executive Raymond Sze and three other partners. They estimate about 100,000 people have played so far.The company now has locations in five Hong Kong neighbourhoods, as well as Taipei, Singapore, Macau and Guangzhou.All the games are created in-house by a team of about three dozen developers led by Mr Sze, who is also a 20-year-old student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (UST).His parents were entrepreneurs, but they did not want the same for their son. Instead, they admonished him to study hard.But Mr Sze, who got his first job at 16, had other ideas. He was dying to start his own business and fulfilled his dream at the age of 19, when Freeing Hong Kong opened."One of the reasons they like to play these games is that it provides a different experience for them. Maybe they want to escape from reality, because you know, reality is very stressful and very competitive," Mr Sze says."It's not because they need to think about their food or their way to live. It is something about society's expectations. They need to achieve so many things."Although Hong Kong is one of the wealthiest cities in Asia, its success has made life difficult for many young people, who struggle to land high-paying jobs to get their foot on the property ladder.The city has some of the most expensive real estate in the world - a recent survey from the Chinese University of Hong Kong suggests salaries are falling far short of property prices.And locals are increasingly competing against ambitious mainland Chinese and Western expatriates for jobs.Mr Sze says he wants to create a healthy outlet for players."You know, Hong Kong people love computer games and actually they lack communication with their friends or their family. In these games, they need to solve the problems and co-operate with each other," he says.The four founders were friends who loved Japanese comics, mysteries and adventure novels.It takes anywhere from a week to three months to come up with a concept. Because they get many repeat players, all the games must be updated or replaced regularly.Mr Sze jokingly calls his school the "University of Stress and Tension", and is currently taking a year off to focus on expanding the firm.He says he had no idea how to set up a company at first. "I Googled everything: how to start a company, how to get a licence, how to get fire insurance," he recalls, laughing.The work seems to have paid off, at least personally."Actually it was very tough for me at the very beginning, but after a few months, when the game became more popular, my parents started to see the media coverage and said, 'Okay, you can take a gap year for this'."</body>

      <description>Celebrating the Pi with fire, vegetables and pets</description>

      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on select buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the actually matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation…. and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <title>Republican debt limit gambit</title>
      <description>Why some Republicans want the US to breach the debt limit</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24393350</url>
      <date>1381193516</date>
      <body>A faction of the Republican Party believes it cannot lose the battle over raising the US government's borrowing limit - either they dismantle the Democrats' healthcare reform, or the country has to live within its means for a while. But will the rest of the party stick with them?It is a high-stakes gambit - the US has never before breached its authority to borrow money to fund its obligations, and most experts warn it could be catastrophic.But a group of hard-line conservatives in Congress think it is worth the risk.Dozens of Republican politicians, such as Steve King of Iowa, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, have suggested in interviews that the US government could prioritise its payments in the event of a debt limit breach, choosing to fund some government expenses - while drastically cutting others."If you don't raise the debt ceiling, what that means is you have a balanced budget," Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN last week. "It doesn't mean you wouldn't pay your bills."The strategy hinges on convincing President Barack Obama that conservatives are willing to break the debt ceiling and devastate the Democratic Party's government priorities, while assuring Republican big-business backers that this would not destroy the economy.It is a fine line, but conservative grass-roots groups think they have found the silver bullet to kill Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law, which Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana called in typical remarks "the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress".If the debt limit is breached so that "Obamacare" can be destroyed and Americans be taught they can live with less government, so be it."Liberals might be so concerned about settling this issue because they do not want Americans to realize that we can survive just fine with a lot less government spending," Jeffrey Dorfman writes in Forbes. "Perhaps we will be better off in the long run if government gets a little taste of what so many families have been experiencing for years: staying within a budget."First-term Republican Representative Ted Yoho of Florida said in an interview with the Washington Post that hitting the debt limit would "bring stability to the world markets", as it would prove the country is serious about balancing its budget.Without the risk of a sovereign debt default, and with Democratic interests feeling the pain of a predicted 32% cut in overall government spending, the theory goes, Republicans would finally have a negotiating advantage."We hit the debt ceiling, and the world won't end," says Dean Clancy, vice-president of public policy for FreedomWorks, a conservative grassroots activism group."Once the public and Wall Street understand that default is not really a possibility, the president's leverage will be greatly diminished and a bipartisan compromise will be achievable."Other Republicans counter that such a strategy is both impractical and dangerous. Even if the treasury department could figure out how to prioritise payments, the uncertainty created by such an action would devastate financial markets."The issue here is honouring our debt obligations," says Bill Hoagland, a senior vice-president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served as a budget aide to former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist."It's stupid, and it's unbelievable we're even having this conversation."Speaker of the House John Boehner, a reluctant recruit to the current budget fight over healthcare reform, has shown hesitation to take the plunge with the conservative caucus once more.Although he continues to assert that his party is united, there were reports in the media last week that he told nervous colleagues that he would not allow a default on the debt - even if that meant relying on Democratic support to pass a debt limit increase.Civil warAccording to Republican campaign strategist and pollster Matthew Towery, the hard-line conservatives will soon learn their plan is unworkable.As in the economic crisis of 2008, when Congress did not pass an economic rescue bill until the stock market took a 700-point drop, rank-and-file Republicans will turn once the financial markets show signs of stress, he says."The president has blatantly stated that Wall Street should be concerned," Mr Towery says. "He wants a drop, as he knows what that would do. They would have to take immediate action."At that point, enough Republicans would come around to give Mr Boehner cover to bring a debt limit increase to a vote in the House."The [Republican] House majority has a pack mentality until things start to go wrong," Mr Towery says. "Once that happens, Boehner not only will have the votes, he'll probably get a majority of the conference to go along with him."As the debt limit approaches, what has been termed a Republican "civil war" between hard-line conservatives and the party establishment may be approaching its end game.The conservative caucus has proven it is willing to continue to escalate the standoff until it achieves unconditional victory. With strong backing from voters at home and a view the "Obamacare" healthcare reform is an existential threat to the country, compromise is not an option.At some point, however, the rest of the Republican Party may decide it is ready to get off this ride."I think Republicans just want out of this mess altogether," Mr Towery says.</body>

      <title>One city's house price surge</title>
      <description>House prices double in a decade - but it's not London</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24348196</url>
      <date>1381100429</date>
      <body>Two cities in the UK - one is a centre of commerce, has runaway house prices, and welcomes a constant stream of overseas property buyers. The other is London.House prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the Nationwide Building Society.That increase is only matched by the trendy north London borough of Islington, and by Westminster in the heart of the capital of the UK.Recent figures show that Scotland's third city is recording a fresh surge in property prices. One estate agent describes the area as a property force field."Everywhere outside is doom and gloom, but it is boom time here," says Brian Sutton, of James and George Collie solicitors and estate agents.Take a closer look at Aberdeen, and its picturesque, shimmering granite homes, and you can see the complexity of the UK property market.The city has demand from first-time buyers willing to pay above valuation levels, interest from workers moving to the area, investors keen to get in on the act, and a lack of homes for sale.All this pushes up prices. Yet, in Scotland as a whole, prices are only creeping up after years of stagnation.It shows that averages can be misleading and that local areas can have very different trends to neighbouring regions, for reasons ranging from the quality of local schools to employment levels.It also questions a widely held belief that the London property market is unique - that soaring prices in the south-east of England are unequalled in the rest of the country.At the mouth of Aberdeen Harbour, next to the fishermen's village of Footdee, is a landmark called the Roundhouse.The Shoremaster's accounts for 1797-98 show that more than £225 was spent on the new house and telescope on the site.Nowadays, first-time buyers in the city can expect to pay up to £140,000 for a one-bedroom flat, or up to £500,000 for a bigger property.Competition for homes means many buyers are paying 5% to 10% over valuation at the moment, says Bill Barclay, partner at Raeburns solicitors and estate agents.Often sales go to sealed bids, with first-timers stretching their savings to compete with buy-to-let investors.Spend a few minutes standing by the harbour and the reason for this active property market is clear - North Sea oil."It drives the local economy," says Mr Barclay. "Big companies are making long-term financial plans for the area, so we are not going to see much changing."The area was not immune to the financial crisis. Banks were not lending at the levels they had been before 2008, but Mr Barclay says Glasgow and Edinburgh suffered much more.Now, he says - using a phrase apt for an oil-producing region - the banks are "starting to open the taps" again to fund mortgages.Figures published by the University of Aberdeen show a 25% increase in the volume of sales in the second quarter of the year compared with the same three months in 2011. Prices were up by 5.5% in the city and its suburbs over the same period.Sales volumes of flats were up by 53% in that time, as buy-to-let investors find the finance and predict demand from tenants.All this is gloomy news for potential first-time buyers. One 32-year-old tells the BBC he has been renting on the south coast of England and then Aberdeen over the past 15 years and is unable to save anything close to what is needed as a deposit.You hardly see a sale sign erected within the city's sought-after areas, with supply low and competition picking up. But the market is far from overheating, as it was in 2007, according to estate agent Brian Sutton."We had people in their early 20s buying property, with 10 to 20 bidding for one property. Competition has come back, but it is three to four people bidding," he says."First-time buyers are in their early 30s, not their 20s, often with their parents helping."He predicts the housing market will continue to rise at a "sustainable rate", especially as the oil companies build headquarters in the area and continue to relocate staff to the region.Prices may grow by single figures year-on-year, he says, but nobody wants to return to the days of 20% a year increases.Much the same point was made by Business Secretary Vince Cable when he raised concerns about a property bubble potentially being inflated by government schemes to kick-start the market."In London and the south east, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures," he said.Despite his warning, the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has been brought forward by three months in England, and the Scottish government has announced the start of its own scheme.The UK and Scottish governments both argue that Help to Buy, which includes allowing buyers to apply for a shared equity loan for part of the property, are vital to give people the chance to secure a mortgage from risk-averse lenders.Buyers only qualify under the Scottish scheme if they are buying a newly built property.Critics might argue that they should encourage the developers to follow the example of the fishermen's cottages at Footdee - where the front doors face inwards to protect occupants from incoming storms.</body>

      <title>Airbus conquers the final frontier</title>
      <description>Airbus breaks Boeing's dominance of the Japanese market</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24424878</url>
      <date>1381138514</date>
      <body>To those who follow the airline industry closely, Airbus's announcement of a deal with Japan Airlines (JAL) may still seem a bit surreal.Come to think of it, Airbus did not even want to build the A350 plane in the first place. It was Boeing's plans to build the Dreamliner that prompted the French firm to alter its course.And now, years later, it is the same plane that has helped it knock down Boeing's near monopoly of the Japanese market.Airbus has agreed to sell 31 of its A350 planes, in a deal worth nearly $9.5bn (£5.9bn) at list prices."This is a big win for Airbus," says Chris de Lavigne, an aviation analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan."This was the final frontier for them and they have conquered it."The A350 is Airbus's newest plane and a direct competitor to US rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.The Dreamliner programme has been hurt by a spate of safety and technical issues in recent months.Earlier this year, a fire broke out in one of JAL's 787 Dreamliners. Then an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight had to make an emergency landing because of a battery fault and a fire in one of the electrical compartments.The incidents resulted in the entire 787 fleet being grounded in January and JAL and ANA having to cancel flightsThe fleet has since been put back in the air, but in August ANA reported that it had found a wiring defect in a fire extinguisher system on three of its 787 Dreamliner jets.Analysts say the issues have played a role in helping Airbus break into the Japanese market."I think there was some frustration with the 787 programme," says Timothy Ross, head of transport research for Asia, at Credit Suisse."It did provide a window for Airbus to make a case for its planes in the Japanese market."Some industry watchers suggest that Airbus also benefited from introducing the A350 ahead of Boeing's 777X - the latest version of its highly successful 777 series - and also a competitor to the A350.Airbus already has more than 750 orders for the A350 and hopes to start delivering the first planes to customers by the end of 2014.JAL is scheduled to receive its A350s by 2019. This means the aircraft would have already been in service for nearly four years by the time JAL receives its planes, giving enough time to sort out any potential teething issues.If it opted for Boeing's 777X - the deliveries of which are not expected to begin for some time - the carrier would most likely have been among the first to operate the planes.Analysts say the problems JAL faced as one of the first operators of the 787 Dreamliner may have played a role in its decision to chose the A350 planes.The 787 issues "inevitably led to doubts about execution, resources and time," says Richard Aboulafia, an airline analyst with the Teal Group.He adds that Boeing has suffered as a result of not staying ahead of the competition."It's the price to be paid for passivity, by not launching this plane one year ago," he explains, referring to the 777X.Boeing has dominated the Japanese market for the past many decades. According to Frost and Sullivan, the US plane-maker has an 80% share of the country's jet market.Not only have Japanese carriers preferred to buy Boeing planes, Japanese manufacturers have also been key supplier of parts to the US firm.The close political ties between the two countries, which often play a key role in securing large plane deals, have also helped Boeing maintain its dominance.But analysts say that given the strong hold enjoyed by Boeing in Japan, it was just a matter of time before Airbus managed to break into it."It is just natural progression, the market is now opening up," says Mr Lavigne of Frost and Sullivan."It was going to happen at some point of time. You can't have a monopoly market forever."He adds that the JAL deal may see further opportunities open up for Airbus in the world's third-largest economy."This could now open the whole Japanese market for Airbus," he says. "There is now going to be true competition between the two players."That can only be good news for Japanese carriers.As the two plane-makers vie for a share of the market, they are are likely to offer much sweeter and more competitive deals to secure orders than they would in a monopoly market."As an airline you want to be able to maintain a competitive tension between two of the biggest airplane manufacturers in the world," says Mr Ross, of Credit Suisse."That helps not just with better purchase prices, but also with after-sales support and maintenance guarantees."Japan's largest airline, ANA, is looking to place an order for 25 jets and is expected to take a decision in the coming months.The firm's fleet is currently dominated by Boeing planes. So far it has given no indication of which plane-maker it may go with.Maybe, it's just waiting for those sweeteners.</body>

      <title>Row over Spain's proposed solar tax</title>
      <description>Row in Spain over proposed toll on solar panel owners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24272061</url>
      <date>1381100409</date>
      <body>"We will be the only country in the world charging for the use of the sun," says Jaume Serrasolses."Strange things are happening in Spain. This is one of them."Mr Serrasolses, the secretary of an association promoting the use of solar energy, SEBA, is referring to the government's proposal for a tax solely on those who generate their own electricity.They would pay a backup toll for the power from their solar panels, in addition to the access toll paid by everyone who consumes electricity from the conventional grid.Although the tolls vary, if you pay an access toll of 0.053 euros per kWh, you could face a backup toll of 0.068 euros per kWh.The new tax would extend the average time it would take for solar panels to pay for themselves from eight to 25 years, according to the solar lobby.The government says that with increasing "self-consumption", the income for conventional energy systems will decrease, but grid maintenance will cost the same."If I produce my own energy, but am connected to the grid, having the backup in case my production fails, I have to contribute to the cost of the entire system," says Energy Secretary Alberto Nadal.The government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros (£22bn; $35bn), which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices.This is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the renewable energy sector.The government has gradually lowered a feed-in tariff - a scheme that paid people to produce their own "green electricity" - first reducing the period over which it was paid, then limiting it to already existing installations and finally an energy reform in July opened up the possibility of withdrawing it retroactively.At the same time it has not endorsed net metering, a policy allowing solar panel owners to send surplus energy to the grid and use it later. The idea was part of a previous proposal but was not included in the latest reform proposal.But while the government may have been heavily promoting solar energy six years ago, those who followed that lead may now pay dearly for their investment."The majority are people like your or my parents who at one time had savings and wanted to make an investment with a better return," says Piet Holtrop, a Dutch lawyer who is defending over 1,000 of them."Many of these people are going to lose their houses (that they used as collateral to buy solar panels). They are unable to pay back at the bank. They can't sell the installations, because the government has made them toxic assets," Mr Holtrop says.Though many people believe the government has succumbed to pressure from the big five energy companies, Mr Nadal insists that "solar energy is much more expensive than that mass-produced by large utilities".He adds that Spain is now paying for being at the forefront of solar energy development: "If we hadn't rushed into constructing large quantities of photovoltaic installations, we could have had them much better for [a] much lower price. It would have been much better introducing them step by step."The backup toll, still to be approved, has already paralysed the photovoltaic sector. "Nobody is going to make significant investment if it takes over 20 years to pay it off," says Jaume Serrasolses.However, the proposal has also prompted defiance.Ricard Jornet has fitted his beachside restaurant with 36 solar panels. Alongside other efficiency measures, they have cut his electricity bill by 40%.To avoid the backup toll, he plans to split the restaurant so that it uses two independent electricity systems, with only 30% connected to the grid. The rest will be self-sufficient, thanks to insulation and batteries storing the produced energy."I will save more money, because for the little part of the restaurant I will pay smaller access toll. I will also prove to the government this is not the way to do things."Civil disobedience is another option, despite hefty fines of up to 30m euros.Oriol, a chicken farmer, is willing to take the risk of undeclared self-consumption. "I believe they will warn me first. Then... we will have to invent another way to save the situation."The fines were originally designed for electricity companies and have to be approved by a cabinet council."The more people disobey, the more difficult it will be to fine them," says Jaume Serrasolses.Spain's energy regulator has sided with the opponents of the toll. It has found the proposal discriminatory, concluding that it makes self-consumption economically unviable and sacrifices middle and long-term economic efficiency for short-term economic sustainability. However, the regulator's word is non-binding.There are hopes that the European Commission will help, as its objective is to achieve 20% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The body is currently probing one of several complaints against Spain's energy policies.However, the Commission might have a dilemma."They are anxious to not jeopardise the plans for Spain's economic recovery," says Piet Holtrop."We are afraid the Commission is willing to sacrifice the EU legal framework for policy objectives."Other countries are carefully watching developments in Spain. The governments in Latvia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece seem to be pondering similar cutbacks."We want to make the Commission aware of the spillover effect," says Mr Holtrop.The backup toll may not end up being introduced, but the proposal has put many people off installing solar panels in the meantime, which means they are still getting their energy from the five big suppliers."I think they (the government) know this proposal does not make sense. They just want to gain time," says Ricard Jornet."[And] during all these months the energy oligopoly is making thousands of millions of euros."</body>

      <title>Turning around the world's oldest travel firm</title>
      <description>The boss trying to return travel firm Thomas Cook to its former glory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24328944</url>
      <date>1381152216</date>
      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.Meanwhile, on Monday, 7 October the company announced the sale of two businesses in Egypt and Lebanon. The two units in question - Thomas Cook Egypt and Thomas Cook Lebanon - offer outbound travel to Egyptian and Lebanese customers.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>How to get broadband to rural UK</title>
      <description>How to get broadband to rural Britain</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24366190</url>
      <date>1381100451</date>
      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>
