      <title>Royal Mail shares jump sharply</title>

      <body>Royal Mail shares rose more than 38% to 456p at the start of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p per share, valuing the 500-year-old company at £3.3bn. The value rose £1.1bn after trading began.At midday, the shares had eased back to 435p, 31.8% up. Private investors received 227 shares each.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Business Secretary Vince Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <title>Syria monitors win Nobel Peace Prize</title>
      <description>The OPCW, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, wins the Nobel Peace Prize.</description>

      <body>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal, has won the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee said it was in honour of the OPCW's "extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons".The OPCW, based in The Hague, was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said the award was a "great honour" and would spur it on in its work.He said the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria had been a "tragic reminder that there remains much work to be done".The OPCW recently sent inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons.It is the first time OPCW inspectors have worked in an active war zone.The watchdog picks up a gold medal and 8m Swedish kronor ($1.25m; £780,000) as winner of the most coveted of the Nobel honours.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the award, saying the OPCW had "greatly strengthened the rule of law in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation".Announcing the award in Oslo, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said it wanted to recognise the OPCW's "extensive work"."The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law," he said."Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons."The OPCW's Ahmet Uzumcu said the organisation had been working "with quiet determination to rid the world of these heinous weapons", away from the spotlight, for the past 16 years.He said the Syria mission was the first time the OPCW had worked to such a short timeframe and in an ongoing conflict, and that it was "conscious of the enormous trust" placed on it by the international community.Praising the commitment of his staff and the support of member states, he said the Nobel Peace Prize would "spur us to untiring effort, even stronger commitment and greater dedication" to bring about a world free of chemical weapons".The head of the OPCW inspection team in Syria, Ake Sellstrom, said: "This is a powerful pat on the back that will strengthen the organisation's work in Syria."The OPCW is made up of 189 member states and the principal role of its 500-strong staff is to monitor and destroy all existing chemical weapons.It draws on a network of some of the best laboratories and scientists in the world to help it in its work, the BBC's science correspondent Pallab Ghosh says.The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention has contributed to the destruction of nearly 80% of the world's chemical weapons stockpile.Syria is expected to sign the treaty in the coming days.French President Francois Hollande said the Nobel prize was a "vindication" of the international efforts in Syria and pledged continued support for the OPCW's work there and elsewhere.US Secretary of State John Kerry said the "Nobel Committee has rightly recognised [the OPCW's] bravery and resolve".European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso, EU President Herman Van Rompuy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel all congratulated the OPCW.There were a record 259 nominees for this year's Peace Prize, but the list remains a secret.Pakistani schoolgirl campaigner Malala Yousafzai and gynaecologist Denis Mukwege of the Democratic Republic of Congo had been tipped as favourites to take the award.Others who had been listed as contenders were Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), the US soldier convicted of giving classified documents to Wikileaks and Maggie Gobran, an Egyptian computer scientist who abandoned her academic career to become a Coptic Christian nun and founded the charity Stephen's Children.But an hour before Friday's announcement, NRK reported the award would go to the OPCW.The European Union won the prize in 2012 in recognition of its contribution to peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.Previous Nobel Peace Prize laureates include anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, US President Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Nobel Committee has in the past publicly regretted never awarding the prize to Mahatma Gandhi, the pacifist leader of the Indian nationalist movement against British rule, even though he was nominated five times.</body>

      <title>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke dies</title>
      <description>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who was serving a life sentence for his role in a WWII massacre, dies in Italy aged 100, his lawyer says.</description>

      <date>1381501850</date>
      <body>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke has died at the age of 100 in Italy, his lawyer has told Italian media.Priebke was jailed for life in 1998 for his role in the WWII massacre of 335 Italians at Rome's Ardeatine Caves.But because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest in the capital.The move caused anger over what some people in the city regarded as conditions that were far too comfortable and lenient.Priebke was one of the SS officers present during the killing of men and boys at the caves in 1944, in a reprisal attack ordered by Adolf Hitler for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters.He was among the officers who oversaw the operation to round up victims and transport them to a network of caves on the outskirts of the city where they were all shot.Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders.In July, an association representing families of some of the victims of the massacre renewed calls for Priebke to "find the courage to ask for forgiveness".He was extradited to Italy in 1994 after he was discovered working as a school teacher in Argentina.He was tracked down by an American journalist working for ABC News and admitted in an interview his role in the massacre.Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said on Friday that he had left a final video interview as his "human and political testament", but it was unclear what it contained and when it would be released.Priebke, who had been living in his lawyer's apartment in Rome, was allowed to do his own shopping, go for walks in the park and go out to restaurants in the evening to eat with friends.</body>

      <title>Racing driver De Villota found dead</title>
      <description>Formula 1 reserve driver Maria De Villota is found dead in a hotel room in the Spanish city of Seville.</description>

      <body>Formula 1 reserve racing driver Maria De Villota has been found dead in a hotel room in Seville, Spain.A police spokeswoman said: "We are assuming it was a natural death, but we cannot confirm anything."Spaniard De Villota, 33, lost her right eye in a crash last July while testing for the Marussia team.She suffered severe head and facial injuries after colliding with a lorry at Duxford Aerodrome,  Cambridgeshire, but had been cleared to resume driving.De Villota, who had been in motor-racing for 12 years, had previously competed in Spanish Formula 3 and the Daytona 24 Hours race in the United States.Her dream of driving a Formula 1 car came two years ago when she tested a Renault.A family statement read: "Dear friends: Maria is gone. She had to go to heaven with all of the angels."De Villota, daughter of ex-Formula 1 driver Emilio, was reported to have been in Seville to launch her autobiography.The police spokeswoman said De Villota's body was found at around 07:00 (06:00 BST) at the Hotel Sevilla Congresos in the southern Spanish city.Forensic scientists and officers from the homicide unit were due to examine the scene.F1 teams and drivers have expressed their shock at the news of her death.Spaniard Fernando Alonso, the Ferrari driver, said: "Today is a very sad day for Spanish sport. We have lost a fighter with a huge smile."Britain's Jenson Button added: "It's horrendous news. Very tragic, the girl has been through so much, more than most people go through in their lives. It has been tough for her but this is horrific news and a real shock to the whole paddock and the world of motorsport."We saw her this year in Barcelona. We were doing some work for a children's charity and she was the first one to put her hand up to do it, and got a lot of other drivers involved - she was doing a lot for the community."Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, who worked alongside De Villota as an ambassador for the Women in Motorsport commission,  told BBC Radio 5 live: "I had so much respect for the courage she had and how she fought against all the odds and I'll always remember her having a smile, no matter what happened."After the accident everybody else would have thought she doesn't really want to have anything to do with motorsport."But no - there she was, texting away and saying she wants to be back as soon as possible."It didn't take her any time at all until she was back; she was planning maybe even to drive but more important to her was to give other people the courage that you can still do so much even if you've had such a major setback."Last year, De Villota spoke movingly about the initial recovery stages following her accident and recalled: "The surgeon came up to me with my family around him and said: 'Maria, we have saved your life, I don't know if you remember you had a serious accident but we have to tell you that you have lost your eye'."I asked him: 'Are you a surgeon? Do you need both hands to operate? I am a Formula 1 driver and I need both eyes to drive."Before, I only saw F1, I saw myself in a car competing. I did not see what was important in life, the clarity to say: 'I am alive'."It has given me my bearings, given me back what's important. I accept it with the energy to say I am going to live out this chance 100%."Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team boss and president of the Formula 1 Teams' Association (Fota), said F1 would discuss what would be the appropriate way to mark De Villota's death over the Japanese Grand Prix weekend but that it was not a simple decision."We will be talking amongst ourselves," he said told BBC Sport. "You have to be careful; a lot of racers don't want these issues to detract from a race weekend."Everyone wants to demonstrate the right level of sympathy but the real racers would want the show to go on and wouldn't want a fuss to be made. It's not something we need to amplify, it's something we've got to be sensitive about."</body>

      <title>Clegg and Cable 'split' over leaks</title>
      <description>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24493062</url>
      <date>1381502403</date>
      <body>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.Mr Cable said the newspaper performed a "very considerable public service" by publishing details of documents leaked by Edward Snowden.But Mr Clegg reaffirmed his belief it was "not good at all" and said the information could "help terrorists".Downing Street said the security services' review system works well.A spokesman, however, said the prime minister is ready to listen to ideas for improving the system.He was speaking as Mr Cable also called for "proper political oversight of the intelligence services".Earlier, Sir David Omand, a UK security expert and former No 10 advisor described the leaks by Mr Snowden as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".In May, Mr Snowden leaked information to the Guardian about mass surveillance programmes such as the US National Security Agency's Prism and GCHQ's Tempora operations.The Guardian has defended its decision to publish documents leaked by the former US intelligence worker, who was granted asylum in Russia, and has vowed to publish more.Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4' Today programme: "I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service."I think Mr Snowden's contribution is two-fold. One is a positive one - the whistleblowing - the other is more worrying which is a large amount of genuinely important intelligence material does seem to have been passed across."We do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now."But Mr Clegg told the BBC: "My view is that publishing information, technical information which can help terrorists work out how to do harm to us, of course, that is not good at all."But of course there is a legitimate, wider debate, an ongoing debate, about how do you make sure, as both the intelligence agencies and those who wish to do us harm, use these considerable new powers at their disposal in information technology, how do we make sure that all of that is held properly to account."Earlier this year, the Justice and Security Act 2013 gave the government's Intelligence and Security committee greater powers to scrutinise the work of the security services.Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be no review of the oversight of the security services, despite Guardian reports that Mr Clegg was to start conversations in government about one.The prime minister said on Thursday "a good legal framework" already existed.A spokesman said Mr Cameron "thinks the current system is a good one and it works well," but "if others have ideas he is prepared to listen to them".Mr Clegg responded to the question of more oversight of the security services on Friday saying the government had already "significantly strengthened the powers of oversight".But he added that "many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified".Former Home Secretary Jack Straw also hit out at the Guardian saying its stance was "indulgent irresponsibility" which did not help protect the public.His comments come in an interview to be broadcast on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales.He said the Guardian had a "sense of power of having these secrets and excitement... about these secrets has gone to their heads"."They are blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are - are or not - likely to damage the national interest," said Mr Straw.Sir David, who is also a former head of the UK's communications surveillance centre GCHQ, told The Times there needed to be a difference acknowledged between whistleblowing to spark a debate and "the stealing of 58,000 top-secret British security documents" which he called "seriously, seriously damaging"."The assumption the experts are working on is that all that information or almost all of it will now be in the hands of Moscow and Beijing," he added.Nigel Inkster, who was director of operations and intelligence at MI6, and is now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told BBC Radio 4 programme The World at One he agreed with Sir David.He said terrorists would have a better awareness of how vulnerable it was to communicate with each other "via any one or any group of communications options that are available to them".He added that in terms of state-on-state espionage, "some of the reach and sophistication of the systems and capabilities developed by NSA and GCHQ have now been compromised".</body>

      <description>A wealthy London woman was murdered by two "compulsive gamblers" in order to steal her property and financial assets, a court hears.</description>

      <body>A wealthy woman was murdered by two "compulsive gamblers" in order to steal her property and financial assets, a court has heard.Carole Waugh, 50, disappeared from her home in Marylebone, central London, in May last year and her remains were found three months later.The Old Bailey heard that Rakesh Bhayani, 41, and Nicholas Kutner, 48, had killed Miss Waugh in order to feed their gambling habit.The pair deny murdering Miss Waugh.Patrick Gibbs QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the men "had a taste for grand and expensive things and were gripped by the same compulsion to gamble".Miss Waugh's body was found in the boot of a car in a garage in New Malden in August 2012.Tests showed she had been stabbed in the neck.Mr Gibbs told the court that "the Crown cannot say whose hand was on the weapon"."But whoever struck the fatal blow, we say that Mr Bhayani and Mr Kutner planned it, and were responsible for it, and having taken her life, they then systematically took all her worldly goods as well."The prosecution claim that the men had a history of tricking and defrauding people.The court heard that once Miss Waugh was dead, Mr Bhayani got a number of women to impersonate the former accounts clerk on the telephone.He then "rehearsed" the women so they could strip Miss Waugh of her assets in shops and banks by using her credit cards.After her death, Miss Waugh's identity was also used to buy gold bullion and Krugerrands, the jury was told.Mr Gibb said the women would not be on trial as the prosecution would focus on the murder of Miss Waugh and the concealment of her murder.He said Miss Waugh had not had a regular job, but had worked as an accounts clerk in Libya in the oil industry and was "a woman who had plenty of money"."That was to prove her undoing," he said."She owned her flat, worth more than £600,000, she had savings, shares, jewellery and a cash income from working as an amateur escort."He told the court that Miss Waugh had known Mr Bhayani for a while, had visited him in prison and lent him £40,000."It seems that she had been intimate with him at one time or another in the past [and] may have first met him through an advertisement of herself as an escort that she had placed on the internet."Like everyone else that has met Mr Bhayani, she was taken in by him."She thought that he was her friend, but you may decide by the end of this trial that Mr Bhayani doesn't really do friends."He said that Mr Bhayani had been released from prison, "knowing how much she had, he planned that she should die".He add that Miss Waugh had known Mr Kutner less well and had not been intimate with him.The trial continues.</body>

      <title>Gaddafi top spy to be tried in Libya</title>
      <description>The International Criminal Court has ruled that Libya's Gaddafi-era intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi, can be tried in Libya.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24493885</url>
      <date>1381497985</date>
      <body>The International Criminal Court has ruled that Libya's Gaddafi-era intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi, can be tried in Libya.The decision means that the ICC will no longer demand that Mr Senussi be sent to The Hague to stand trial.The former military intelligence boss was indicted by the ICC in 2011 for war crimes allegedly committed during the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi.Mr Senussi was extradited to Libya from Mauritania last year.The ICC does not carry out proceedings against a suspect if it deems they are receiving a fair trial in a domestic court.A pre-trial chamber at the ICC decided that "Libya is willing and able genuinely to carry out" investigations into Mr Senussi, the court said in a statement.It said the decision had "no bearing on the case against Saif al-Islam Gaddafi".The late leader's son was also indicted by the ICC for war crimes, and is a co-defendant, along with 36 others, of Mr Senussi in the domestic case.The ICC said Libya had failed to show it had collected more than "a few sparse items of evidence" against Mr Gaddafi and had yet to secure him legal representation.A court in Tripoli is to decide on 24 October whether to indict Mr Gaddafi and Mr Senussi, among 20 figures of the former regime charged with the 2011 killings of protesters, Agence France-Presse reported.Saif Gaddafi is being held by a militia in the western town of Zintan. Last month the militiamen refused to deliver him to a court in Tripoli to appear at a pre-trial hearing alongside Mr Senussi and the other defendants in that case.He is facing trial in Zintan on a separate charge of trading information threatening Libya's national security. That case has been adjourned until 12 December.The ICC said its decision not to try Mr Senussi - Col Gaddafi's brother-in-law and said to have been one of his closest aides - could be appealed against if it later decides the trial is unfair.Mr Senussi has been implicated in an infamous Libyan massacre in 1996, in which more than 1,000 inmates were killed at the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli.In 1999 Mr Senussi was tried in absentia in France and sentenced to life imprisonment for the shooting down of a UTA airliner over Niger a decade earlier.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both campaigned for the immediate transfer of Mr Senussi and Mr Gaddafi to the ICC.Amnesty said Libya still needed to improve security and rebuild the country's justice system to ensure fair impartial trials.Libya has been beset by security problems since the 2011 uprising, during which Col Gaddafi was captured and killed while trying to hide from rebels.Earlier this week, the country's prime minister, Ali Zeidan, was kidnapped for several hours by armed militiamen.</body>

      <body>The remains of two people have been found in a back garden in Nottinghamshire, police have confirmed.Officers said human remains were found in the garden of a property in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, on Thursday.Police said they were led to the address after information came to light about an "incident" alleged to have taken place in the late 1990s.A neighbour said an elderly couple had lived in the property in the 1990s but had disappeared.The 51-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, said the couple were living at the house when she moved in 18 years ago.She said: "They never had any visitors. I never saw anyone coming or going."My friend and I always used to say, 'I wonder what happened to that couple'. They just disappeared. We thought they had emigrated."Nottinghamshire Police said it could not comment on the claim.Insp Mark Webster said it could be "several weeks or months" before the bodies were formally identified.He said the current owners of the house were not part of the investigation at this time and confirmed no arrests had been made.A post-mortem examination to establish the causes of death was being carried out on Friday.Mr Webster appealed for anyone with information on the discovery to come forward but said residents should not be fearful."We don't believe that there is any risk of any harm coming to the community," he added."People are clearly going to be concerned when an incident of this nature happens and we would like to reassure them."The property remains cordoned off while forensic examinations are carried out.</body>

      <title>Total gay blood ban 'is irrational'</title>
      <description>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge rules</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24494371</url>
      <date>1381502282</date>
      <body>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge has ruled.He also held that Health Minister Edwin Poots breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive.The judge gave the verdict in a challenge brought by an unidentified homosexual man.The complete ban, put in place during the 1980s, was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.It was replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago.The 12-month deferral was left in place following a Government Advisory Committee report.It identified a much shorter period during which infection with blood-borne viruses could not be detected.Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety.But a gay man granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability launched a judicial review challenge to Mr Poots' position on blood donation.The judge heard claims that the minister displayed apparent bias that went beyond religious beliefs and into the realms of prejudice.It was revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.Attorney General John Larkin QC, the chief legal adviser to the Stormont Executive, questioned the legitimacy of the challenge.He claimed the challenge was a waste of time because the applicant had previously had sex for money.Mr Larkin rejected arguments that the issue required full executive approval and questioned whether the minister had made a decision to maintain the current ban.However, the judge said that in continuing the lifetime deferral policy the minister had deviated from the position taken in England, Scotland and Wales.He said the decision was made against the secretary of state's recommendation that the report from the advisory committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) should be followed.The judge held that the additional risk from deferring donation for 12 months, instead of permanently, was very minimal.He said: "The minister has decided that MSM (males who have sex with other males) behaviour creates such a high risk of infection to the donor that such donors must be permanently deferred with the result that such blood cannot enter the Northern Ireland blood stock."Importing blood from other places which do accept MSM donors, even in limited quantities, leaves the door open for MSM blood to do just that."There is clearly a defect in reason here."Applying different standards to imported blood defeats the whole purpose of a permanent deferral, he added.Declaring the decision irrational, he said: "If there is a genuine concern about the safety of MSM donated blood such that the blood stock must be protected absolutely from such blood then the security of that blood must actually be maintained absolutely."Dealing with the alleged breach of the ministerial code, the judge said the lifetime ban was both controversial and cross-cutting, taking in equality issues."As such the minister had no authority to act without bringing them to the attention of the Executive Committee which he failed to do."In doing so the minister breached the ministerial code and... had no legal authority to take a decision in breach of the ministerial code."</body>

      <title>National Trust 'failing' tenants</title>
      <description>National Trust tenants across the country claim they are being badly treated, pushed out of their homes and left thousands of pounds out of pocket by the organisation, the BBC finds.</description>

      <body>The High Peak area of Derbyshire forms a beautiful rugged landscape. Like so much of Britain's uplands, it is countryside preserved and protected by the National Trust.Many of the traditional stone cottages dotted across the hills are Trust owned, providing homes for some of its 6,500 tenants.But according the the National Trust's own tenants' association, it too often fails in its basic duty as a landlord.One of the cottages has been home to the Dean family since last year. Carl and Wendy Dean say moving to the picturesque property with their four children was a dream come true.But in a few weeks, they will be required to pack up and move out.It's a bitter blow, especially after they've just spent £6,000 improving the property. They've fitted a new kitchen, new flooring and redecorated.No-one is saying the National Trust is breaking the law, or even the rules.The Deans did only sign an initial six-month contract, but they expected it to be extended.They say they were told by a National Trust representative that being able to stay long term was "standard practice" if they were good tenants - an assurance the Trust say was never made.Standing in their front room Wendy is sobbing: "It's appalling. We are devastated. It's made me feel ill. We are not expecting them to change their minds. We know we are going but we don't want this to happen to somebody else."Her husband says: "We are being moved out like you would move cattle around. They don't care that we are a family, they've just said, 'Right, your time is up.'"The Tenants' Association of the National Trust (TANT) says there are growing problems across the country, with their helpline taking calls about poor repairs, rising rents - and, increasingly, tenancy disputes.Andrew Turner Cross is a long-time Trust tenant. He is also chairman of TANT."What we're looking for is a fair deal for tenants, we're getting all too many calls on our helpline to do with the same old problems - leases, repairs and rental increases… some of those cases are quite heartbreaking."Of course, thousands of tenants live happily in National Trust properties, and it says it simply doesn't recognise reports of widespread discontent.Clearly, caring for and maintaining old, sometimes ancient housing stock is difficult and costly.Mary Marshall has been a Trust tenant in West Wycombe for more than two decades. She describes it as a first-class landlord.And she says her fellow tenants should make allowances for the fact they live in such desirable properties."I think you have to accept that you are moving into a part of history," she says."You are part of the history of the country and the buildings. And it is a privilege to live in a place like this. You need to accept that the Trust are doing everything in their power to conserve it."But the BBC has seen an internal report that suggests there is also some serious dissatisfaction.The survey - commissioned by the National Trust itself - concludes that although 72% of tenants are happy, there is a "disconnect between tenants' and landlords' expectations".It also says: "The National Trust falls short of the 'special' expectations of them but also of the basic expectations of a landlord."The National Trust's rural enterprise director, Patrick Begg, says: "It's not a damning indictment. I don't think it's universal, I think the vast majority of what we do, we get right, in places we don't."I can't say enough times, I don't recognise that picture. We stand behind our role as a professional and fair landlord. We are always striving to do better, of course, but with a track record of success."But among the significant number of National Trust tenants who are unhappy is hill farmer Neil Priestly.When land next to his existing National Trust farm came up for rent, he jumped at chance to grow his business, paying out thousands for sheep especially suited to this hard landscapeAgain, he was on a fixed contract. Again, he says he was told it would be renewed after 12 months as a formality.But the Trust denies this and now requires him to move on."If they'd come and from the start said this is what the plan is going to be, but a total lack of communication and a lack of regard for my own personal financial well being or anything like that, they've just ploughed on, on this road that they've set off down, with total disregard for local people," he said.The National Trust is among our best loved, best supported charities. The uncomfortable message from some of its tenants is that it is better at conserving buildings and landscapes than looking after the people who rely on it for their homes.</body>

      <title>Driving test age rise considered</title>
      <description>Teenagers could have to wait a year longer before being allowed to take their driving test under proposals being considered by the government.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24485792</url>
      <date>1381493119</date>
      <body>Teenagers could have to wait a year longer than currently before they are allowed to take their driving test.The government is considering issuing only 12-month probationary licences at the age of 18 in a bid to cut accidents involving young motorists.New drivers would also face a curfew between 22:00 and 05:00 unless a passenger aged over 30 was in the car.Ministers are due to publish a Green Paper this year after considering the Transport Research Laboratory's report.It recommends a one-year "learner stage" beginning at 17, during which drivers would have to total at least 100 hours of daytime and 20 hours of night-time practice under supervision.Learners can then take their test at 18 and, if they pass, will get a probationary licence and have to display a green "P" plate.During this stage, drivers will face the curfew and all those under 30 will be banned from carrying any passengers also under 30.Other proposals under consideration for young drivers are a ban on all mobile phone use, including hands-free phones, and a lower alcohol limit.After the 12-month probationary period, drivers will automatically graduate to a full licence and unrestricted driving.Statistics show that more than a fifth of deaths on British roads in 2011 involved drivers aged 17-24.The report suggests implementing this new system could cut annual casualty numbers by 4,471 and save £224m.A Department for Transport spokesman said: "Young drivers drive around 5% of all the miles driven in Britain but are involved in about 20% of the crashes where someone is killed or seriously injured."We are committed to improving safety for young drivers and reducing their insurance costs - that is why we are publishing a Green Paper later in the year setting out our proposals."This will include a discussion about how people learn to drive."The research report has been produced by the Transport Research Laboratory under commission by the Department for Transport and it, amongst other things, has informed the Green Paper."Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation motoring research charity, welcomed the proposals.He said: "Young people are four times more likely to die in a road accident than as a result of drink or drugs."Yet, as a society we seem to turn a blind eye to the carnage. If this was any other area of public health there would be an outcry."This is about ensuring their long-term safety and mobility. Not curtailing it."Edmund King, president of motoring organisation the AA, said the proposals were addressing the problem of young drivers in the "wrong way"."You should prepare young drivers to be safe when they get their licence rather than give them their licence and then restrict them," he told BBC's Breakfast.He said he would like to see mandatory lessons on motorways, in rural areas and in bad weather, and warned of the problems of policing the restrictions such as carrying young passengers.Julie Townsend, of road safety charity Brake, welcomed the report, saying it was further recognition of the compelling case for graduated driver licensing.She urged the government to act "swiftly and decisively" to commit to the system to help reduce the danger young drivers posed to themselves and others.Currently drivers in England, Scotland and Wales need to pass a theory test, then a practical test before they can apply for a full driving licence. The minimum age to hold a full car licence is 17, or 16 for some people claiming mobility benefit.Your commentsMy son is 12-years-old and has had five lessons with a young drivers school. Why doesn't the government promote these in school? They give kids the chance to learn at a early age to drive sensibly. These school are run throughout the country but even after taking lessons they don't get any credit from insurance companies. Let's look at this instead of increasing the age of driving. Rod Peart, Carlisle, CumbriaI think it is great to raise the age, set out curfews and limit the amount of hours that these kids need to practice before taking their test. My son is now 18-years-old, but he had a lot of practice on the road and passed second time round. He seems very aware of the dangers. But not all his peers are the same - at least three of them have had accidents during their first few weeks of driving - at least two of those accidents were because they were showing off to each other. Go on - raise the age and add some curfews. Gael Atkinson, SussexI am 17-years-of-age and have been learning for the past four months and I am almost ready to take my test. Whilst on my driving lessons my instructor and I see countless people over the age of 30 driving dangerously. Age is not the problem, maturity is. My family have been in few collisions where people over the age of fifty haven't looked or couldn't control their car. Where are the limitations for them?Reanne, Exeter, DevonMy 19-year-old son has recently passed his test and my 17-year-old will be wanting lessons at some point. We live in a rural area where there is little public transport. This suggestion would mean that my 17-year-old son would not be able to take up a night shift job to support himself or drive to school. Rather than fiddle about with difficult to enforce curfews, etc. for young drivers, would it not be better to have a more rigorous driving test, involving motorways, rural roads and night driving?John Hall, Steeple Bumpstead, EssexAs a driving instructor I welcome these proposals. We need to get people talking about how we can improve the skills of new drivers. The statistics for accidents involving young drivers are horrific. The probationary licence for new drivers sounds like a good idea in theory although we kind of have that at the moment, as if you accrue six points in your first year of driving you will have to resit your test. I myself would be in favour of a longer test with all the manoeuvres and motorway driving looked at. Steve Kirk, Bolton, Greater ManchesterIt should be raised to the age of 21. This would reduce accidents, free up roads, increase use of public transport, make young people walk or cycle thereby promoting health and energy, ensure that some maturity and responsibility in life was achieved prior to driving, and would reduce insurance costs for all. I have three sons, all aged over 23, only one drives having passed his test at the age of 22. Gary Stapleton Harrogate, North YorkshireBy the time teenagers learn to drive they are expected to take contract buses into college, or get public transport to work or apprenticeships. The price of these go up way higher than the rate of inflation and it's clearly forcing everyone onto the road. It's not just teenagers who are being involved in accidents! A lot of colleagues at school will have to take more money from their parents to be able to pay for transport. They will be even more dependent on their parents. I, myself, haven't learned to drive yet, I am 18 and am starting driving lessons soon. I just think that these sort of measures are driving the country into some Orwellian Police State.Miles, Fareham</body>

      <date>1381492399</date>
      <body>Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.He added: "She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'"The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.He added: "I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages."The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.The existence of the so-called "God particle", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: "How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming."An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.Prof Higgs added: "In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime."But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there".Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: "I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern."I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels."Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive."But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists."Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960."Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: "It's very nice to be right sometimes."</body>

      <body>Asda has withdrawn an offer that inadvertently promised a £50 discount.Hundreds of people took advantage of the online voucher, which gave the discount if you spent as little as a penny over £50.The supermarket said the problem was the result of a "rogue code", and that it would not honour outstanding orders made with the voucher.Asda told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours: "We're aware of a glitch with our e-vouchering, and are addressing it."Some shoppers reported using codes more than once to buy electrical goods. Others have been contacted to say their orders have been cancelled.Nick Devine, 23, from Leeds was sent the instructions by a friend, and tried to take advantage of a deal that seemed to offer practically free shopping.He said: "I logged on, entered the code a few times because it didn't work at first. You could tell there was maybe a glitch in the system."I bought two-and-a-half litres of vodka and three bottles of mixer, checked out and it came to zero."I said I'd pick it up from Asda so I didn't have to pay the delivery costs, but I've woken up to a text message this morning to say it's been cancelled."The supermarket told the BBC: "We've removed the glitch, which has prevented customers from using the rogue voucher and we apologise for any confusion caused."Asda added that its terms and conditions state that it reserves "the right to withdraw or cancel any of its e-vouchers at any time".</body>

      <body>The Vatican has withdrawn from sale 6,000 copies of a new papal medal on which the name of Jesus was misspelt.In an inscription around the edge of the coin, Jesus was spelt with an L instead of a J.Keen-eyed experts snapped up a handful of the coins, which were struck in gold, silver and bronze by the Italian mint, before the mistake was noticed.Vatican coins and medals bearing the face of Pope Francis are bought by collectors all over the world.A few collectors may make a fortune because of the scarcity value of the flawed medals, the BBC's David Willey reports from Rome.New medals are struck when every new pope is elected and they provide a useful source of income for the Vatican, which is undergoing a major spending review under the leadership of Pope Francis, our correspondent says.As news of the mistake travelled, social media users cracked jokes about this new religious figure, "Lesus" Christ. "I blame the Lesuits," went one tweet while another had "Let us prey Lesus".</body>

      <title>I was offered £20K to fix - O'Sullivan</title>
      <description>World snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will be asked to explain claims he rejected a £20,000 offer to fix a match.</description>

      <body>World champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will be asked to explain claims he rejected a £20,000 offer to fix a Premier League snooker match about 10 years ago."Someone rang me and said he'd like to meet me over in the forest and have a walk through the woods," O'Sullivan, 37, wrote in his new autobiography."What they were offering, 20 grand," he added, "I could get for a couple of nights' work."Snooker's governing body said he would be asked to clarify his claims."We are aware of what has been said in his book and we will be writing to Ronnie O'Sullivan to ask him to explain his comments," said Nigel Mawer, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's disciplinary committee.O'Sullivan, who won his fifth world title in May after taking a six-month break from the sport, said the meeting - in Epping Forest, Essex - lasted about 15 minutes."If anyone could get away with it, I could. I could just play one-handed or left-handed, or just put a towel over my head, and pretend I was going nuts," he said."But it's not something I would or could do. I couldn't live with myself; I'd feel that was robbing somebody."The revelation comes less than a month after former world top-five player Stephen Lee was handed a 12-year ban after being found guilty of seven match-fixing charges. He is appealing against the verdict.In an interview with BBC Sport, O'Sullivan was asked whether he had ever considered throwing a match."I can't do it. I enjoy playing - snooker's given me a great life," he said."You put all of that on the line. Without snooker you'd lose friends and family."You're not just taking the money, but jeopardising relationships with people, the sport, and the opportunity to embrace great things that being a professional snooker player can give you."O'Sullivan recently backtracked on a claim he made that Lee was not the only player guilty of match-fixing.The Essex player, nicknamed 'The Rocket', had originally tweeted: "I've heard there's many more players who throw snooker matches."I suppose Steve Lee was just caught out."No need to worry if you got nothing to hide. But plenty of people have got loads to hide. That's why there is no free speech. They're hiding."World Snooker boss Barry Hearn reacted by stating O'Sullivan's comments were "unacceptable and damaging".O'Sullivan later said he had "no concrete evidence of match-fixing in snooker", but hinted players were aware of who might be involved.</body>

      <title>FA panel members pointless - Lineker</title>
      <description>Former England captain Gary Lineker says most members of a new FA commission on the England team are "utterly pointless".</description>

      <date>1381495433</date>
      <body>Former England captain Gary Lineker says most members of a new Football Association commission to improve the national team are "utterly pointless".Eight people have been named on a group set up by new FA chairman Greg Dyke."No wonder they announced Glenn Hoddle early on. Most of the others are utterly pointless. Expected better from Greg Dyke," said Lineker on Twitter. Dyke says the line-up of the commission is not yet complete.He is joined by former England manager and player Hoddle, ex-England defender Danny Mills, former Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson and FA vice-chairman Roger Burden.Football League chairman Greg Clarke, new Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman Ritchie Humphreys and Crewe director of football Dario Gradi have also been named on the panel.Its focus is to increase the number of England-qualified players appearing for the country's top clubs and improve the England national team.Lineker, the BBC's Match of the Day presenter, indicated former internationals Chris Waddle, John Barnes and Gary Neville would be "apt" choices for the panel.The PFA's representative, Chesterfield striker Humphreys, said he hoped to draw on the experience and diversity of the association's members."We would be daft not to tap into that wide variety of knowledge," the 35-year-old former Sheffield Wednesday and Hartlepool player told BBC Radio 5 live."We have a common ground. We are a very diverse organisation and just want the national team to improve."Last month, Dyke set England targets of reaching the Euro 2020 semi-finals and winning the World Cup in 2022.English footballers account for less than a third of all the minutes played in the Premier League, according to a State of the Game study published by BBC Sport on Thursday.The figure for home country players - 32.26% - is down from 35.43% in 2007-08 and is significantly lower than all other major European leagues according to football statisticians Opta.Lineker was joined by former England striker Stan Collymore in criticising the FA panel's make-up."The FA commission. Dario Gradi should have been asked 20 years ago but he's 72 now. Wilkinson 70. Is that really vibrant and fresh?" said ex-Liverpool and Nottingham Forest striker Collymore on Twitter. Meanwhile, former England defender Sol Campbell has criticised the lack of diversity, with eight white men on the panel."I wouldn't mind if they had some black players in there, black players who have actually done something for club and country," Campbell told BBC Sport.Hoddle has suggested a nationality quota system should be employed in the Premier League - an idea backed by PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor - and called for all concerned to be "ruthless" in the quest to improve chances of success at international level.The Premier League says it will help the commission, but has so far rejected the chance to have an official representative on the panel.Everton's chief executive Robert Elstone has insisted top clubs are not the source of all England's failings, but rather a strength.He argued the number of foreign players in the English top flight meant youngsters had to raise their game to compete at an elite level with the world's top players - so the system was producing better young players."How many great players do we actually need to win a World Cup? The Belgians might do it with 15? Maybe it's time to think quality and not quantity?" wrote Elstone in a blog on the club's website. "Our English talent looks over its shoulder every day. They have players from all over the world chasing their livelihoods. Where better to get the 20, 30 or 40 players we need to fight with the best in the world at a national level?"He cited the Premier League's Elite Player Performance Plan in bringing through players such as Everton and England midfielder Ross Barkley.</body>

      <title>Heineken Cup pool-by-pool guide</title>
      <description>Who are the contenders for the knockout stage as Europe's showpiece tournament gets under way?</description>

      <date>1381499065</date>
      <body>Much of the focus ahead of the 19th edition of the Heineken Cup has been on the battles off, rather than on, the field.English and French clubs' long-standing issues over money and qualification for the competition have grown to a full-scale rebellion, with plans for a breakaway Rugby Champions Cup for 2014-15 putting the tournament's future in serious doubt.But while the political wrangling continues behind the scenes, the on-pitch power struggles begin on Friday.After winning their first Heineken Cup in May, Toulon are again likely to face a stiff challenge from Clermont Auvergne, while Saracens could be the pick of the English challengers.Once again there are 24 teams in six pools of four and the pool winners, plus two best runners-up, progress to the quarter-finals.Former England centre Jeremy Guscott, who won the tournament with Bath in 1998, gives his assessment on who will make it into the knockout phase.Heineken Cup pedigree - last year: third in Pool Four, best: semi-finals in 01-02Star player: Second row Richie GrayCoach: Matthias RollandPosition in Top 14 in 2012-13: 4th (champions). Current: 11thHeineken Cup pedigree - last year: second in Pool Five, best: champions 08-09, 10-11 and 11-12Star player: Centre Brian O'DriscollCoach: Matt O'ConnorPosition in Pro12 League in 2012-13: 2nd (champions).

Current: 3rdJeremy Guscott's view: "This is a great pool in terms of the quality of the teams involved but it also goes a good way to showing us that the seeding is not right."Castres and Leinster are Top 14 and Pro12 champions respectively and there's no way they should be in the same group."Leinster and Saints would be my favourites to qualify from this group unless Ospreys buck a Welsh region trend and find some form in this competition."I don't think Castres will compete in the Heineken Cup this season, they're under new coaches and will concentrate on domestic survival. This competition will be a distraction for them."There's quite a bit of uncertainty at Leinster, it's legendary centre Brian O'Driscoll's last year, former coach Joe Schmidt has gone and Matt O'Connor has come in from Leicester."Add in speculation about a few players possibly going to France, and the camp is not as settled as it has been in recent times."Despite all that going on behind the scenes they do have a high-calibre roster and they are more than capable of winning the competition again."Saints have a lot to prove to themselves - can they deliver on the biggest stage at long last? With the likes of George North and Tom Wood in their ranks, they have the players to do well."The big matches will be 7 and 14 December when Northampton and Leinster meet on consecutive weekends."If Saints lose the first one at home it will be nigh on impossible to qualify."Leinster to go throughHeineken Cup pedigree - last year: third in Pool Six, best: runners-up in 95-96Star player: Flanker Sam WarburtonCoach: Phil DaviesPosition in Pro12 in 2012-13: 9th.

Current: 1stGuscott's view: "Defending champions Toulon will be massive favourites to move on from this pool and into the knockout stages."Glasgow's league form is very good but Europe has not been the happiest hunting ground for them."Exeter never give anything short of 100% home or away, and they almost beat Leinster in their competition debut last season."Cardiff have three British and Irish Lions superstars in Sam Warburton, Leigh Halfpenny and Alex Cuthbert, plus enough national talent to do some damage, but because of Welsh regions' past poor history, I'm not holding my breath for them to come through."If the superstars of Toulon think this pool is easy, that's a big mistake, I believe these teams on their day could beat most teams so they cannot afford to mess around by sending second teams to away matches, expecting a comfortable win."After seeing South Africa wing Bryan Habana score his brilliant second try against the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship decider last week, I can't wait to see him in action for Toulon."The big matches look like the two meetings between the superstars of Cardiff and the galacticos of Toulon but I don't think those two clashes will be the decider. Toulon are far better than the rest of the pool."Toulon to go throughHeineken Cup pedigree - last year: third in pool three, best: third in pool 12-13Star player: Fly-half Dan ParksCoach: Pat LamPosition in Pro12 in 2012-13: 8th.

Current: 10thGuscott's view: "Toulouse have become a bit of a forgotten force in this competition, despite having won it four times before."It's about time they showed up and proved their pedigree.

      <title>Lewis Hamilton: Savouring the Suzuka magic</title>
      <description>Mercedes driver and 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton talks about the magic of the Suzuka track in his latest BBC Sport column</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24487478</url>
      <date>1381477818</date>
      <body>I went to Tokyo after the Korean Grand Prix to prepare for this weekend's race in Japan, which is one of the best of the year.I trained for a couple of days, made sure I had good food, had a wander around and enjoyed the culture, and then headed down to Suzuka. It's always a trip you make with excitement and anticipation.Suzuka is one of the older-school circuits. I remember watching Ayrton Senna racing here when I was growing up, so it has a historical resonance for me and it's cool that I'm doing the same now.For the drivers it is such a challenging circuit. It's unique in that it is the only figure-of-eight layout in the calendar, and it has such a good combination of corners.It is balanced left to right, in that the tyres wear equally on both sides of the car, which helps, and it is very fast from the get-go on the lap.You have to have a very good and high-downforce package and a very stiff set-up, so the car reacts quickly and feels more alive.The track has loads of undulations - up out of Turn Two to Turn Seven, then back down into the double left-hander called Spoon, then up again to 130R, which is a cool corner at nearly 200mph.That's super-fast, obviously, but we have a lot of downforce in Formula 1, so we probably don't notice it as much as you would think.The first sector is my favourite: the left-right-left-right-left through the Esses and into Dunlop is so challenging.The entry into the first left is at more than 150mph and you have to be so accurate with your turn-in point.If you get that wrong, you miss the apex - the mid-point of the corner we try to hit - and because the corners all follow on one from the other that screws you up for the next corner and the next one and the next one. It all starts from the first turn-in point for Turn Three. It's a real neat section of corners.You learn a lot from the different drivers you race with. My old team-mate Jenson Button had a different technique from me through there when we were at McLaren.I would use my aggressive style and he would have a slightly different approach and I am going to adapt some of the approach he had and combine it with my own style this year to try to make my overall performance better.But it's not just the track that makes Suzuka special. The whole ambience of the Japanese Grand Prix is great - and a lot of that is down to the fans.They are so enthusiastic - thousands of people were sitting in the grandstand opposite the pits even on Thursday, when nothing was happening. It's great to see.The fans were allowed out on the circuit on Thursday and I know some of the other drivers met them when they were doing their track walk - when you do a lap on foot with your engineer.I don't do them any more. I used to, all the way through Formula Three, GP2 and my first four years in F1. Then it got to a point when I wasn't gaining anything from it.The point of a track walk is to see anything new about the track that might be useful, but we do an 'out lap' at the start of first practice, and you take it real easy, so you see everything you need to see then.So the only real benefit of a track walk is it is a period of time you can talk with your engineer, but you can do that in the office in the paddock in a much more relaxed environment, and you're not all sweaty.I'm optimistic that my Mercedes team could have a good weekend in Japan.We were very quick in the middle sector in Korea last weekend, and that is the part of that track which is all medium- and high-speed flowing corners, a bit like Suzuka.In the past few years, the first sector has been the one where Red Bull have beaten everyone, just because they have more outright downforce than anyone else.This week, I was watching one of Sebastian Vettel's on-board laps from a year or so ago and it was fascinating. His line was interesting, to say the least, in the Esses - certainly not the one I would have chosen - and he was still so rapid through that sector.It's critical to have a real steady ride-height through there. So if we can be quick there on Friday we should be set for the weekend. We need to be competing with Red Bull through there, and I'm hopeful that will be the case after Korea.I haven't been able to win since Hungary and that's simply because Red Bull have done such a good job with their car.We won in Hungary, but we were on pole there and that makes it so much easier to win.People don't realise that the driver behind can be affected by the disturbed - or 'dirty' - air coming off the car in front even if they're as much as four seconds behind.We won Hungary on merit, but not because we were the quickest. We were in the right place at the right time, and Sebastian was stuck in traffic for a lot of the race.Since then, there is no doubt Red Bull have done a great job with their aerodynamic package.Sebastian was on the front row with me in Spa - and passed me on the first lap because the car was so much quicker - and he has been on pole in Italy, Singapore and Korea.That's what made the difference.I had high tyre wear in Korea but we've figured out why I was causing that to happen and hopefully we can take the fight to Red Bull this weekend.Just finally, I wanted to say a big thank you for the responses I got to the last column. The fans don't realise how much they mean to me and it's really good to have that support.Lewis Hamilton was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson</body>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel headed Mark Webber in a Red Bull one-two in Friday practice at the Japanese Grand Prix.Vettel, who had been third behind the two Mercedes cars in the first session, outpaced Webber by 0.168 seconds.Mercedes' Nico Rosberg was third fastest, 0.262secs off Vettel, and ahead of Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean.Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton was sixth and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso 10th after a spin at the Degner corners.Minutes before the end of the second session, it emerged that former Marussia test driver Maria de Villota had been found dead in her hotel room in Seville.Suzuka lived up to its reputation as one of the most difficult tracks in the world, catching out even the best drivers, with Vettel, Alonso, Hamilton and Raikkonen all having moments of varying severity."The balance is decent," said Vettel. "I think we can still improve the car, especially looking after the tyres, which will be crucial for the race."It's tricky. We've seen a lot of drivers struggling, it's a difficult track."Alonso, who must finish eighth or better on Sunday if Vettel wins to prevent the German from winning the title, promised on Thursday that he would "attack" for the rest of the season now his title hopes were all but over and he had an uncharacteristically messy day.He ran wide at both the Hairpin and Spoon Curve in the first session and then had a spin on his first flying lap on the faster 'medium' tyre, ensuring he did not set a representative time and ended the session 0.389secs slower than team-mate Felipe Massa.It was a sobering day for Alonso, for a glance at the times suggests that finishing eighth may not be that easy.That is the position where Massa ended up - behind the Red Bulls, the Mercedes, the Lotuses and the surprise Toro Rosso of Daniel Ricciardo.Alonso's struggles appeared to confirm the impression that Ferrari have slipped backwards in the last few races.Hamilton and Vettel joined Alonso in having incidents.The Englishman got his Mercedes on to the exit kerb at Degner Two but rescued the car, while Lotus's Romain Grosjean had a very similar moment a few minutes later.And Vettel had a brief off-track excursion at Spoon Curve before rejoining.Others were not so lucky.Raikkonen got in his medium tyre qualifying simulation run but then spun in the middle of the fast Dunlop Curve and beached the car in the gravel during his race-simulation run.Both McLaren's Sergio Perez and Williams's Pastor Maldonado crashed early in the session, and missed out on both their qualifying and race-simulation runs.Maldonado lost his car at the tricky Degner Two corner, where Marussia's Jules Bianchi and Caterham's Giedo van der Garde had both crashed in the first session.Perez then spun at the entry to Spoon Curve after letting his outside wheels stray partially off the track as he turned in at about 120mph.The McLaren hit the barrier heavily side-on but Perez, who is under pressure because he has still not had his contract renewed for next season, was unhurt."On the entry I put a wheel on the asphalt and I lost the back end," said Perez. "There is not much room so I went straight into the wall."McLaren managing director Jonathan Neale said "internal discussions" were still taking place over Perez's future, but confirmed that Button, who was ninth, was under contract.Full second practice results.</body>

      <title>Barclays to join Help to Buy scheme</title>
      <description>Barclays has become the latest bank to announce it is signing up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <body>Barclays has become the latest bank to announce it is signing up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.This means about two-thirds of lenders in the UK's mortgage market have said they will sign up to the project.The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.The move leaves Nationwide Building Society as the UK's only major mortgage lender yet to decide whether to join.Barclays has not yet published details of any rates or timing of mortgage products that fall under the Help to Buy umbrella."We are pleased to confirm that Barclays will participate in the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme," a spokesman for the bank said.Under the latest phase of the scheme, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is up to 0.9% of the original loan level. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Borrowers who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.Products are already on the market from RBS/NatWest and the Halifax, with Santander, HSBC, Virgin Money, Lloyds, TSB and Aldermore all saying that they will start offering products by the start of January.The government has said that the scheme will correct a problem in the market that locks out a number of tenants paying high rents and unable to save enough for a deposit, even though they could afford mortgage repayments.But Labour said the focus should be on house building, to correct a lack of supply of affordable homes.The latest news of Barclays' participation comes as mortgage lenders reported that the number of first-time buyers was already growing quickly from a low base.The Council of Mortgage Lenders said that the number of loans approved for first-time buyers rose by 33% in August compared with the same month a year earlier.</body>

      <title>Plaid's pledge to cut energy bills</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, addressing the party conference, announces plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24457978</url>
      <date>1381503345</date>
      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has announced plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.Energy Wales would buy gas and electricity at wholesale prices and sell direct to consumers and firms, she told the Aberystwyth conference.Surpluses would be spit between protecting customers and expanding energy efficiency measures.Ms Wood said the firm would work as an arms-length company like Welsh Water."When Labour's energy price freeze begins to thaw and prices begin to spike again, Plaid Cymru would have enabled the building of our cheaper, permanent, people-powered Welsh alternative," she said.In her second annual conference speech since being elected party leader, she said Plaid would recruit 1,000 extra doctors if it won the assembly election in 2016.This would be financed by a sugary drink levy of up to 20p per litre, she said.She also announced radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales over the next assembly term.Ms Wood also announced an "alternative way forward" on hospital reorganisation plans.Labour has accused her of blocking a controversial shake-up of some specialist services without suggesting alternatives.Welsh Labour ministers have insisted closing some hospitals and moving some core services from smaller to larger hospitals are essential to make the NHS safe and sustainable.Some of the most controversial have been in south Wales, with opposition to proposals to move key specialist care from Llantrisant's Royal Glamorgan hospital as part of changes at five health boards.Ms Wood said Plaid was committed to delivering a better Welsh NHS with 1,000 extra doctors."We will provide more doctors so these services can stay open and stay safe," she said.Money would be raised by levy of up to 20p a litre on sugary drinks."If a thousand extra doctors sounds over-ambitious consider this."With them, Wales would only be brought up to the UK average - so we must have those extra doctors."She told party members this would help provide a more efficient NHS, as would plans to better integrate hospitals and social care "to get patients out of hospital and back into their own home".The Plaid leader said funding to begin this integration had already been won as part of a package of measures the party had this week announced with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers in a deal on the Welsh budget.Ms Wood said there was a "crisis of obesity and diabetes that was killing us as a nation."She also unveiled radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales, over the next assembly term.Plaid has said previously Wales can learn from how Norway, Germany and Denmark have offered modern hospital care without centralisation.The party has argued planning the NHS workforce more effectively and better recruitment practices would help reduce some of the strains on the health service.Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru was the only party addressing people's big concerns at the 2016 assembly election and that "Wales is better than this".Ms Wood started her speech by saying Plaid would build on recent momentum.She said this would "carry us forward over the finishing line" to win the assembly election in 2016."It isn't a sprint but a marathon and I'm firing the starting pistol here today."She said she was committed to Plaid being the next government of Wales "so we can build Wales up, turn around the economic situation, stand on our own two feet."Plaid Cymru also points to the budget deal it signed with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers earlier in the week which put more money into treating patients in the community as a way of both improving services and keeping more patients out of hospital.All party members who attend the two-day conference will be able to vote on the motions debated. Until now that was reserved for delegates representing various sections of the party.The change is part of internal reforms brought in following Plaid Cymru's disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election.Ms Wood promoted plans to cut business rates for smaller firms on the opening day of the two-day Aberystwyth event.Firms would qualify for reduced business rates if their rateable values was below £15,000, rather than £12,000 under the current regime.A rateable value below £10,000 would mean paying no business rates, rather than the £6,000 ceiling at present.Ms Wood has also defended her party's election performances since devolution.With the SNP in government in Scotland, she was asked on BBC Radio Wales why the Scottish nationalists had moved so much further on than Plaid."I think it reflects the different settlement that Wales has had compared to Scotland," said Ms Wood."Scotland is so much further ahead in terms of the devolution settlement and Wales is in a different place."Our settlement is much weaker as is our economic situation and that's why I've said since I've become the leader of Plaid Cymru that the economy and job creation should be our number one priority."I would argue that Scotland has got a government that puts Scotland first and Scottish communities first at every opportunity and Wales needs a government now that will do that and I would argue that a Plaid Cymru government after 2016 is what the country needs now."SNP MP Pete Wishart urged Plaid activists to join in with the campaign.To enthusiastic applause, he told the conference: "We will win, because independence is the aspiration...that puts the future of Scotland in the hands of the people who live and work in Scotland."</body>

      <title>Vitamin D 'no effect' on the healthy</title>
      <description>Healthy adults do not need to take vitamin D supplements, suggests a study in The Lancet which found they had no beneficial effect on bone density, a sign of osteoporosis.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24473156</url>
      <date>1381448556</date>
      <body>Healthy adults do not need to take vitamin D supplements, suggests a study in The Lancet which found they had no beneficial effect on bone density, a sign of osteoporosis.But experts say many other factors could be at play and people should not stop taking supplements.University of Auckland researchers analysed 23 studies involving more than 4,000 healthy people.The UK government recommends children and over-65s take a daily supplement.The New Zealand research team conducted a meta-analysis of all randomised trials examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density in healthy adults up to July 2012.The supplements were taken for an average of two years by the study participants.Bone mineral density is a measure of bone strength and measures the amount of bone mineral present at different sites in the body. It is often seen as an indicator for the risk of osteoporosis, which can lead to an increased risk of fracture.The trials took place in a number of different countries including the UK, the US, Australia, Holland, Finland and Norway.Although the results did not identify any benefits for people who took vitamin D, they did find a small but statistically significant increase in bone density at the neck of the femur near the hip joint.According to the authors, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.Prof Ian Reid, lead study author, from the University of Auckland, said the findings showed that healthy adults did not need to take vitamin D supplements."Our data suggest that the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare."Writing about the study in The Lancet, Clifford J Rosen from the Maine Medical Research Institute agrees that science's understanding of vitamin D supports the findings for healthy adults, but not for everyone."Supplementation to prevent osteoporosis in healthy adults is not warranted. However, maintenance of vitamin D stores in the elderly combined with sufficient dietary calcium intake remains an effective approach for prevention of hip fractures."The Department of Health currently recommends that a daily supplement of vitamin D of 10 micrograms (0.01mg) should be taken by pregnant and breastfeeding women and people over 65, while babies aged six months to five years should take vitamin drops containing 7 to 8.5 micrograms (0.007-0.0085mg) per day.Dr Laura Tripkovic, research fellow in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Surrey, said the study was important but very specific."I'm not surprised they didn't find any evidence of the effects of vitamin D on bone density because there are so many other factors involved in osteoporosis, like genes, diet and environment."To pin it all on vitamin D... it's difficult to do that."Dr Tripkovic said it was no good taking vitamin D supplements if people didn't also maintain a healthy, balanced diet containing calcium and take plenty of exercise.She said most healthy people should be able to absorb enough vitamin D naturally, through sunshine and diet."But if people are worried about their vitamin D levels then a multi-vitamin tablet would do. If you have bone pain and muscle aches then you should go and see your GP and discuss it."We get most of our vitamin D from sunlight on our skin, but it is also found in certain foods like oily fish, eggs and breakfast cereals.However, taking too much vitamin D in the form of supplements can be harmful because calcium can build up and damage the kidneys.Experts advise taking no more than 25 micrograms (0.025mg) a day.The UK guidance is currently being reviewed.</body>

      <description>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.</description>

      <date>1381492741</date>
      <body>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.The National Secular Society (NSS) says some groups are holding assemblies and bible clubs in schools in England.The NSS has written to the Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for national guidance on external visitors, particularly from religious groups.The government said it had not seen any evidence to support the claims and had not received any complaints.The report says there has been "a marked increase in the number of parents contacting the National Secular Society with concerns about external visitors to schools exposing their children to unwelcome and wholly inappropriate religious evangelism and proselytisation".It added: "We have investigated this and found an abundance of material showing that the parents' concerns were not isolated instances."The report says that in many cases, evangelical Christian organisations offer to provide religious education and school worship.It claims that the legal obligation on schools to provide religious education and a daily act of worship has provided "a foot in the door" to some organisations with evangelistic intentions.The report suggests that shortfalls in religious education provision, recently highlighted in a report from Ofsted, are leading head teachers to accept help from external religious groups and adds that some heads are "insufficiently discerning about the external groups they are allowing into their schools".The letter also asks the Department for Education to ensure that guidance to schools on visits from religious groups "makes clear that schools must not offer opportunities to groups seeking to evangelise".The NSS says its investigation was prompted after it was contacted by parents, some of whom had themselves written to the schools and to the Department for Education about their concerns.One parent said he had become aware "quite by chance" of regular visits by an evangelical group to his child's non-religious primary school in Sheffield.He complains that the group "adheres to a profoundly conservative and avowedly missionary agenda".Another complained that his child had been told the creation story from Genesis was "factual" during visits to a primary school in the West Midlands from a local minister.Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "Religious education must be clearly delineated as such."A line is crossed when religious positions such as creationism are taught as scientific theories for example. Neither are schools places for proselytisation without the explicit and informed consent of parents."A spokeswoman for the DfE said if parents had concerns about visitors to their child's school they should make a formal complaint to the school."State schools cannot teach creationism as scientific fact," added the spokeswoman."They must offer a broad and balanced curriculum and meet their obligations under equalities legislation. Schools have a responsibility under law to ensure children are insulated from political activity and campaigning."Schools are required to safeguard the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils."Ofsted inspections include a focus on this to enable them to identify any inappropriate practice."</body>

      <description>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley has said.He said it could shift the "whole landscape of e-commerce" if it bought, for example, eBay.He said it should ignore the wishes of activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants the company to buy back stock."Apple's about building great products, building and shaping markets," Mr Sculley said."Carl Icahn has suggested to [Apple chief executive] Tim Cook, 'Why don't you buy more stock back or make a bigger dividend?'"I'd rather see Apple continue to invest in building... even make big acquisitions that were strategic, as opposed to buying more stock back, or giving more dividends."Mr Sculley was the chief executive of Apple between 1983 and 1993.During his tenure, he famously engineered the "forcing out" of Steve Jobs from the company - a decision he later said was due to his own inexperience in appreciating Mr Jobs' vision for future products.Traditionally, Apple has not acquired large scale companies - instead buying smaller companies with specific technologies, and folding them into the business.One recent example of this is Siri, a company Apple acquired in 2010 when it wanted to provide an integrated personal assistant on its iPhone and iPad products.Mr Sculley said that while he had "no insider knowledge" of the firm he left in 1993, he said he now wonders if it is time for Apple to change its growth strategy."Apple's never been an acquirer of big companies before, and when you look at the [Apple digital ticket system] Passbook, and fingerprint recognition - what would it mean if Apple went out and bought eBay? And they had PayPal, and integrated that?"My guess is you'd suddenly see the whole landscape of e-commerce shift."You have Amazon, which is on the fast-track to dominate every aspect of e-commerce - suddenly the game, the landscape, would change."Mr Sculley was in London ahead of the UK launch of the latest product he is working on - the Misfit Shine, a wearable device that monitors various aspects of a person's health."The future of wearable products has the potential to have a huge impact on healthcare," he said.He also, at the age of 74, offers his services as a mentor to up and coming Silicon Valley chief executives - something he said he wished he had while at Apple."When you're dealing in industries where there's such a thin line between success and failure, having another set of trusted eyes can be a real nice advantage."Mr Sculley also offered warm words for the soon-to-be-departing Microsoft boss, Steve Ballmer."Here's a man who has spent 33 years at Microsoft, loves the company," he said. "He really did not get enough credit for what he did accomplish."I can't name a CEO who didn't make some mistakes in the hi-tech industry."I think Ballmer has a lot he ought to be proud of. So he didn't get everything right - not many people do."He added: "I think it's important the CEOs do move on."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <title>Dead star eats water-rich asteroid</title>
      <description>Astronomers detect the tell-tale signs of a shattered asteroid being eaten by a dead star, or white dwarf.</description>

      <date>1381489170</date>
      <body>Astronomers have detected the tell-tale signs of a shattered asteroid being eaten by a dead star, or white dwarf.The Hubble telescope spotted the event some 150 light-years from Earth.The researchers tell Science Magazine that the chemical signatures in the star's atmosphere indicate the asteroid must contain a lot of water.This makes it the first time both water and a rocky surface - key components for habitable planets - have been found together beyond our Solar System.The dead star is called GD 61. It has long since burnt through its nuclear fuel and has shrunk down to a dimly glowing ember.But its gravity is still intense, and it is shredding rocky objects in its vicinity and pulling the debris into its outermost layers.Hubble and the Hawaiian Keck observatory record how this inflow of material taints the star's atmosphere.They detect elements such as magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen - the chemical ingredients of rock minerals.But what piques the scientists' interest is the abundance of oxygen.This is far too high to be explained just from the in-fall of rock, and indicates that whatever is being dragged on to the dwarf must also contain a lot of water.The team's calculations point to the source body being an asteroid at least 90km across and composed of perhaps 26% by mass of water.This is very similar to Ceres, the largest asteroid in the main belt of our Solar System and the target of a Nasa probe next year.By way of comparison, the Earth is a very dry object, containing just 0.02% by mass of water, and much of this was probably delivered by comets and asteroids.The astronomers - from the universities of Cambridge and Warwick, UK, and from Kiel, Germany - speculate that a similar water-delivery system could also have occurred in the GD 61 system, which is very likely to have had rocky planets in its heyday.Lead author Dr Jay Farihi told the BBC's Science In Action programme: "The reason that we can say that is that the planet-formation process starts with things as small as dust grains. They grow into things as big as pebbles and boulders and then as large as asteroids. Once you get to things as big as asteroids, planets are essentially inevitable - it's a runaway process; you simply cannot stop it."Having asteroids and no planets is logically possible but it's very likely physically implausible. So, we know there were rocky planets [in GD 61] because we can see the rocky building blocks; and we know there was the potential to deliver water to their surfaces because we've seen at least one very water-rich and large asteroid."Of the 1,000 planets so far identified beyond our Solar System, none has been definitively associated with the presence of water.For most of these objects, all that is known is a few details such as distance, size, density and the time taken to orbit the host star. The Hubble-Keck observations therefore represent the first time water has definitively been put in immediate contact with a far-off rocky surface, says Dr Farihi.The GD 61 system also gives us a glimpse of what is likely to occur one day in the vicinity of our own star - the Sun. Billions of years into the future, it too will burn out and shrink into a white dwarf, consuming asteroids and other debris."I think alien astronomers would then be getting pretty similar information to what we're getting on GD 61," Dr Farihi, from the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy, explained."I guess it would depend on what time they looked and which asteroid they were lucky enough to catch. But we know of water-rich asteroids in the outer main belt and I think there would be a good chance that they would see a signature of something like the asteroid Ceres. And in that case, if the alien astronomers speculated about habitable planets - well, if they're looking back at our system, in that case they'd be correct."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Yeti classic among Doctor Who trove</title>
      <description>The discovery in Nigeria of nine lost episodes of 1960s Doctor Who includes the classic story The Web of Fear, in which Patrick Troughton's Doctor battles robot yeti in the London Underground.</description>

      <body>Nine missing episodes of 1960s Doctor Who have been found at a TV station in Nigeria, including most of the classic story The Web of Fear.The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground.Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World.It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades."It's thrilling," said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who."Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible."The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s.However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes.In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos.The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive.Mr Morris said: "The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria. I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who. When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special."He said it had been a "lucky" find given the high temperatures in the African country. "Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition."Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive. The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story.Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever. Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered.Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday.The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97.One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm.Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield.Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton).The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea.The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system."It's the quintessential Doctor Who story," said Gatiss. "It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location."He said it showed Troughton "at the height of his powers".Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret.The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers.Recalling Troughton's "wonderful sense of humour" on set, Watling said: "We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle. We had a chemistry and I think it showed."How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? "I couldn't quite believe it. There had been hoaxes before. I thought it was just another hoax."Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991.Hines said: "This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork."The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.</body>

      <title>Sunday v Dimanche</title>
      <description>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle.</description>

      <body>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle. But how has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society and do the French really have anything to fear?In November 1993, protesters from across much of the UK (although not Scotland) were confident they could keep big shops closed on Sundays.Outside Parliament they raised placards reading "Don't give in to supermarket greed" and "No government can change the laws of God".Things always appeared very different across the Channel. The French had always seemed to grasp the notion of work-life balance - in British imagination at least, reserving their weekends for red wine and serene lunches.Not everybody in the UK shared that desire for a day of rest, however. "About 50 years ago Sundays were completely dead," says Joe Moran, a cultural historian.Once, pubs had to close between 3-7pm on a Sunday, and theatres and cinemas were closed altogether. Those rules were steadily relaxed in the years that intervened, but by the early 90s most shops were still banned from trading on Sundays.Michael Schluter, founder of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wanted to keep it that way, and lobbied MPs to support his movement. In December 1993, a vote in the House of Commons saw Schluter's vision defeated by just 18 votes. The following year all restrictions were removed from small shops, and those "over 280 square metres" in size were allowed to trade for six hours each Sunday.Today you only need to stand in a DIY superstore in a desolate retail park on a Sunday morning to see how things have changed. Customers gather in the store in the half-hour "browsing time" before the tills open, glancing over expectantly, ready to pounce. Their day is built around a visit to a big shop."It's fairly obvious that Sunday is a huge trading day in this country in spite of the fact that it's limited to six hours," says Richard Perks of market research firm Mintel.The British Retail Consortium says it is second only to Saturday for footfall and total sales - and is the biggest day in terms of hourly sales, as customers try to squeeze their shopping into the six hour window.While the UK has opened its shops on Sunday since 1994, the French have managed to keep most of theirs closed.It's easy to conjure up a vision of a stereotypical French Sunday and imagine families hiking through the Fontainebleau forest, cycling to the Bois de Boulogne park, or rounding off their poulet roti with a freshly baked tarte aux fraises.But now 20 years after the British battle was settled, a similar quarrel is bubbling in France, where different groups of workers take to the streets of Paris to argue both sides of the case. Its tangled web of regulations has been dubbed a "millefeuille" by the press - after the intricate, multi-layered, French pastry of the same name.Shops in designated tourist zones can open, as can garden centres and small owner-operated shops. Those selling food are permitted half a day's trading. For the most part, though, major retailers are forced to close all day, which has angered many business leaders, and some of their workers too.Castorama and Leroy Merlin - two major French DIY chains - have chosen to defy the ban, opening their doors to shoppers on the day of rest, and their employees have backed them. They have held "Yes Weekend" demonstrations to argue for their right to work.In the UK, there seems to be a particular link between Sunday leisure and home improvement.On a typical British Sunday, streams of family cars wait patiently for a space beneath IKEA's blue and yellow facade, trundling out hours later with open boots tied down by rope.It isn't just shopping that has turned Sundays upside down. The proliferation of televised sport has also contributed to a steady erosion of the distinction between the first and second days of the weekend. Schluter is convinced that the UK has lost something along the way, however.Besides small shops that have suffered from increased competition, family ties have been damaged too, he says. "There's a psychological shift which is hard to pin down or measure… towards an attitude that is less about the value of people and relationships and more about material goods."But the example of the British reforms is an inspiration to some French campaigners. Jerome Dubus of MEDEF, a consortium of French business leaders, says that reforms are overdue. "We are one of the last countries that haven't allowed Sunday work, we are behind as usual. I was a student in England 30 years ago. On Sundays everything was closed, there was nothing going on, we didn't know what to do, and the English were attached to it. But now it has changed a lot."Of course, the unions disagree. Christophe Le Comte, of Force Ouvriere, says that the move is just another example of employers trying to exploit their staff. "They are increasing the length of the working day, they are pushing back the age of retirement," he says. Le Comte bemoans the lack of employment protection in the UK and says Sunday trading had "disastrous consequences" for small businesses in the UK.Some change looks likely. The French government has now commissioned a review into the regulations, but whether it will endorse wholesale reform or add more layers to the pastry is difficult to know.Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French columnist for the British Daily Telegraph, thinks the unions are projecting a romantic notion of life in the country that is essentially a fiction."They describe a kind of idealised France of the 1950s in which everybody has got 2.3 children, and a dog, and a little house, and the children organise Sunday lunch for all members of the family."But half the households in large cities are single person households… so what they're describing is something that doesn't exist anymore."Trish Deseine, a food writer in Paris, has a very different outlook, and the city she describes will still sound appealing to the UK's Keep Sunday Special campaigners, who are still campaigning."If you walk by Montparnasse, you will see big family reunions in the restaurants," she says. "There is a definite distinction between Sunday and the rest of the week. There is a sense of occasion. It is quieter and more family oriented. I really hope it stays this way."She does not think the restrictions can last forever, but seems determined that change should at least be delayed."Eventually France will have to come around. The French are dragging their heels into a modern way of life, but I think it is a good thing that we are standing against it."Should France follow the UK and allow shops to open on Sundays? How has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society? Do the French really have anything to fear?Comment using the form below, on Facebook or on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Man died after eating caffeine mints</title>
      <description>A coroner is writing to the government with concerns over a high-energy mint, after a Black Country man died from a caffeine overdose caused by eating too many of them.</description>

      <body>A man died from a caffeine overdose after eating too many high-energy mints, an inquest heard.John Jackson was found dead at his home in Wednesbury, West Midlands, on 2 May after eating Hero Instant Energy Mints.The 40-year-old had twice the recommended adult daily caffeine intake in his blood.Coroner Robin Balmain, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, said he would contact the Department of Health to see if action should be taken.Mr Jackson's daughter, Rebecca Court, 23, said her father had treated the energy products "like they were any other mint"."There is a warning on them, but it's tiny and in the shops they're sold next to all the other mints," she said."It's scary. I think they should be sold behind the counter."Speaking after the inquest, Mr Balmain said: "I think the public need to know about these mints."Each one contains as much caffeine as the leading energy drink."There are people who constantly chew on sweets."If they eat these mints, they might ingest a huge amount of caffeine without knowing it."Mr Jackson, from Walsall Road, had a liver condition which was a contributory factor in his death.However, the cause of death was given as caffeine toxicity.Mr Balmain said he had never come across caffeine overdose as a cause of death before.He could not say how many of the sweets Mr Jackson had eaten before his death, or whether the deceased man was aware of their high caffeine content."He may not have have been aware of the dangers - I think there's a strong possibility of that," Mr Balmain said."These mints cost £4 for a packet of 12 but, nevertheless, they are mints and people may treat them as sweets."A spokesperson for Hero Energy said they were shocked at the news of Mr Jackson's death.He said the company was very vocal about the associated risks of caffeine consumption."We have many satisfied customers and their health and safety is very important to us," he said."We will continue to strive for greater levels of consumer education, so customers can make informed decisions about all caffeinated products."</body>

      <body>A man from Port Glasgow has been formally arrested in Pakistan along with three other men in connection with the murder of his wife.Abdul Sattar's wife Mumtaz was killed in Pakistan on 21 September.Mr Sattar, 40, claimed the couple were drugged, attacked and thrown out of a taxi shortly after arriving in Lahore.They had been on their way to see his parents in Punjab. Mrs Sattar later died and was buried in Shahkot.Her husband has been detained in custody by police.The announcement was made at a media conference in Glasgow held by relatives of Mrs Sattar and the family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar.Mr Anwar said: "I can advise that Abdul Sattar has now been formally arrested and is presently in custody."I was advised by the investigating officer yesterday evening that all of Mumtaz Sattar's property, including her jewellery, as well as Mr Sattar's credit cards, passport and £3,500, were recovered yesterday. Included in the items was Mumtaz's diary."Mr Anwar said police in Pakistan had found a white car which Mr Sattar had said was a taxi used to transport him and his wife from outside the security perimeter of the airport in Lahore.The police had confirmed the vehicle was not a taxi, Mr Anwar said. He added that Mr Sattar had been seen on CCTV greeting males from the white car.He added: "Three other suspects in the murder have also been formally arrested. These men, who were on the run following the recovery of the white car on Sunday, are allegedly linked to the white car and to Abdul Sattar."Mr Anwar said he expected all four accused men to appear in court on Saturday, with bail likely to be opposed by the police.Scottish police have been helping the Pakistani authorities with their investigation.Last weekend the governor of the Punjab region, former Glasgow MP Mohammad Sarwar, assured Mrs Sattar's relatives that "justice will be done".</body>

      <body>A man who murdered a pensioner in his own home in West Lothian has been jailed for life.Keiryn Nisbet had denied killing Robert Simpson, 67, known as Ronnie, in Mayfield Drive, Armadale, on 6 October 2012.Nisbet, 22, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years before being eligible for parole.Sentencing Nisbet, judge Norman Ritchie QC said: "You are a danger to the public."He added: "This was a horrific and sustained attack on an old man in his own home."Nisbet entered the flat of Mr Simpson, who was a complete stranger, and repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on his head and body.He also struck Mr Simpson on the head with a blunt instrument and dragged him across the floor of his house.Mr Simpson received a number of blows to his head, but died as a result of injuries to his body which included fractured ribs.At the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Ritchie added: "For no known reason you assaulted Mr Simpson. This brutal and senseless attack left Mr Simpson lying dying in the living room of his flat."Mr Simpson had left his front door unlocked and it is thought Nisbet, who had been drinking for 10 hours and taken heroin and cocaine, may have gone inside thinking it was a former girlfriend's home.Once inside he subjected Mr Simpson, who was sitting watching television, to the violent attack.The police were called, but when they arrived they found Mr Simpson's home in darkness and left after seeing no signs of a disturbance.During that time Nisbet was in the flat with Mr Simpson.Judge Ritchie told Nisbet: "You did not get help for him. He either died in front of you or you left him to die alone."Nisbet showed no remorse and later tried to get into a nightclub before heading to a house party.When questioned by police he denied ever being in Mr Simpson's home, but was caught by forensic evidence as palm and fingerprints were found in the flat, along with footwear impressions, blood and DNA.Distinctive fibres from a red hooded top he was wearing that evening were also found while CCTV evidence and witnesses also placed him near the scene.Nisbet, who was on bail at the time, sent a message to a friend on Facebook saying he had attacked a man but could not fully remember what he had done.He continues to insist he is innocent.Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for High Court cases in the east of Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet subjected Robert Simpson, a quiet and frail man who walked with the aid of a walking stick, to a sustained, vicious and unprovoked attack in his own home."Det Ch Insp Robert Cowper, of Police Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet did not know Ronnie Simpson and throughout or enquiries we have been unable to establish any possible motive for this violent attack, which resulted in the 67-year-old's death."He has proven himself to be a cold and callous individual, who has shown no remorse for his actions and the impact they have had on Mr Simpson's family."With Keiryn Nisbet now set to spend a considerable period of time behind bars, I sincerely hope that Mr Simpson's family can put this horrendous ordeal behind them and begin to move on with their lives."</body>

He had suffered 31 bruises to his head that medical experts said were possibly as a result of being punched.The coroner said it was disturbing that nobody had been made amenable.Samantha Bennett, the toddler's mother told the inquest she could not give any explanation as to how he sustained his injuries.She described how she had returned home from a shopping trip to find ambulance crews working on the unconscious child.Her then fiancé, Noel McKeown, had been looking after Liam and the child's older sister at the couple's home in Sunningdale Park.Ms Bennett wept as she described Liam lying on his bed wearing sunglasses earlier on the evening of his death. She had bought them for him as they were planning a trip to Tenerife to see his father.She said at this time he had been "in good form", but that he had cried a little when she took his dummy away at bedtime. She had left to go shopping after ensuring Liam was asleep. Noel McKeown, she said, was on the computer.A short time later, he rang her and told her Liam was not breathing and to "get home quick".Her voice breaking, Ms Bennett said: "Liam was lying in the hall on the floorboards and paramedics were working on him. I was in shock and kept shouting 'what's happened to Liam, what's happened to Liam?'"Mr McKeown had apparently tried to perform mouth to mouth resuscitation, guided by ambulance staff over the phone until they arrived.The coroner asked Ms Bennett if she could give the court any explanation of how Liam had sustained his injuries.Weeping, she replied with a single, almost inaudible, "no".Asked by her own barrister if she had caused those injuries, again she replied "no".Mr McKeown also gave evidence to the inquest via Skype from Australia where he is currently working.The coroner summarised Ms Bennett's evidence and asked Mr McKeown if he accepted this version of events. He said that he did.Technical problems with the connection meant he could not be seen by those in the court. There was total silence as his voice came through the small speaker of a tablet computer.He said Samantha Bennett had told him Liam was in bed and that he was not to disturb him. He said this was an unusually early time for Liam to be put to bed.Mr McKeown also said it was unusual for Ms Bennett to go out shopping at that time on a Saturday night."A short time after Samantha left, I heard a crying noise coming from Liam's bedroom. I went in. His back was totally arched and he was struggling to breathe," he said.He said that when Ms Bennett arrived home, she had been quiet.As with Ms Bennett, Mr McKeown was asked if he had any explanation as to how the injuries had been caused? He replied "no".The coroner asked "Did you cause those injuries?" He replied: "No, I did not."No-one has ever been charged in relation to the death, despite the police having carried out an investigation at the time.A retired detective told the inquest on Thursday that there was not enough evidence to establish who had caused the injuries to Liam.</body>

      <title>Be part of NI success story: Cameron</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron says Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.</description>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has said Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.Mr Cameron was addressing a major investment conference in Belfast.He urged foreign investors to "put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story"."Some people say it's a bit undignified for a prime minster to make a sales pitch, I say nonsense," he said."I'm passionate about the power of business to create jobs and growth and I'm passionate about what Northern Ireland has to offer, and so I'm here today with a very simple message."Put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story because investing in Northern Ireland makes good business sense."Mr Cameron told the conference at Belfast's Titanic Building that Northern Ireland had put on a "great G8" during the summer."What was seen this summer was a new Northern Ireland open for business, ready for investment, strengthening the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity and determined to be defined not by divided past but by shared future," he said."With over 800 foreign investors, Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment, with almost 8,000 jobs from foreign investment in the last three years alone."Mr Cameron also visited the east Belfast factory of the aerospace company Bombardier, which said it will create at least 250 new jobs in the city over the next 12 months.On Thursday, it emerged the company hopes a future research programme will employ an additional 230 people.Speaking at Stormont Castle at the end of the conference, Mr Cameron condemned the murders of two men in Belfast and Londonderry."These murders are despicable and the people responsible should be hunted down prosecuted and convicted, they should face justice," he said.Mr Cameron said that investors believed Northern Ireland was a "safe and secure" place to do business.He said that First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness had taken risks for peace and that they would continue to take risks to ensure there was progress."They come from very different political parties, different traditions but they work together for the people of Northern Ireland," Mr Cameron added.Earlier, the first and deputy first ministers said Northern Ireland has much to offer international investors.Mr Robinson said Northern Ireland has "many of the building blocks in place" to take its economy to a "higher level".Mr McGuinness said the country had a young, educated workforce and offered a high standard of living.Mr Robinson said the key to moving Northern Ireland forward as one community was creating jobs and promoting social inclusion.He said at the heart of the Northern Ireland Executive's programme for government was the creation of a vibrant economy."The reaction we often get from potential investors who take the time to come here is that 'we didn't think that Northern Ireland had so much to offer,'" he said.Mr Robinson also joked that he hoped those attending the conference had enjoyed a traditional healthy, fat-free Northern Ireland breakfast.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness told delegates that Northern Ireland was a "very safe place to invest and to live, with very low crime levels".He said existing inward investors had been impressed with what Northern Ireland had to offer, including its "young educated workforce", excellent telecommunications infrastructure, government support and its location as a "gateway to Europe".Mr McGuinness said people in Northern Ireland had a "strong work ethic" and more than 60% of school leavers continued their studies by taking either further or higher education courses.The deputy first minister also praised the quality of life in Northern Ireland. He told investors that they would never be more than an hour's drive from either the sea or the mountains, and could enjoy first class golfing and fishing facilities.Speaking at the conference on Friday morning, Northern Ireland Economy Minister Arlene Foster said Mr Cameron had fulfilled a commitment he had made during the summer, when the prime minister hosted the G8 summit in County Fermanagh.She said he had promised in June to return to Northern Ireland to promote the role he believes it can play in the wider UK economy, and she added that the business event was part of the "economic legacy of the G8".Ms Foster said she was "very confident that there will be investment after this conference".The economy minister was asked if the murders of Kevin Kearney and Barry McCrory, who were shot dead within 48 hours in Belfast and Londonderry, had overshadowed the event.Ms Foster said: "Obviously those of us who live here are shocked and horrified that those sorts of murders can take place on our streets."However, she added: "We've been focusing on talking to the delegates about the good things in Northern Ireland - that fact that we have such good skills here, and if people invest in Northern Ireland they will definitely get value for money."The conference is the first event of its kind in Northern Ireland, since the global downturn began in 2008.</body>

      <title>Fears autistic pupils 'missing out'</title>
      <description>There are fears some children with suspected autism in Wales are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.</description>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed.Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis.In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis.According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education.But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed.Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties.But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis.His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area."I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn.She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities."When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said."They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space."Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism."I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said."In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well."Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom."It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said."The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas."A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need."We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities."We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD."A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times."The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said."The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner."More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday.</body>

      <title>Migrants drown in Egypt capsize</title>
      <description>At least 12 migrants drown and some 116 are rescued after their boat capsizes off Egypt's coast near Alexandria, security officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 12 migrants have drowned and some 116 were rescued after their boat capsized near the Egyptian port of Alexandria, security officials said.The boat sank early on Friday. The survivors, mostly Palestinians and Syrians, were taken to a naval base.The incident comes a week after at least 311 migrants died when their boat sank off an Italian island.Only 155 people survived the disaster near Lampedusa - divers are still searching for bodies there.Alexandria's security chief, Amin Ezzeddin, told the BBC that the survivors of the latest incident included 40 Syrians, 72 Palestinians and four Egyptians.They were initially taken to a naval base in the Alexandria district of Ras al-Tin and then to a police station.The accident follows another capsizing understood to have happened 10 days ago, also involving Syrians and Palestinians off the coast of Alexandria.More than 3,400 refugees have attempted to make an illegal crossing from Egypt over to Europe since August this year, according to the UNHCR.Many are Syrian and Palestinians escaping conflict in their countries.The Lampedusa incident, in which the boat caught fire and capsized less than 1km (half a mile) from the island's shore has prompted an EU pledge 30m euros ($40m; £25m) to help refugees in Italy.On Thursday the European Union also voted to launch a maritime surveillance system aimed at preventing further migrant disasters.Ministers say the 35m-euros Eurosur programme, which includes plans to share data and use surveillance drones, should speed up the EU response to boats packed with migrants heading for Europe.But opponents insist the bloc needs to provide safer ways for genuine refugees to enter Europe. They say the money would be better spent on increasing physical rescue capabilities.</body>

      <title>Mozambique expels 'thieves' coach</title>
      <description>Mozambique expels the Portuguese football coach of one of its biggest teams after he called Mozambicans "a bunch of thieves".</description>

      <date>1381493729</date>
      <body>Mozambique's Labour Minister Helena Taipo has expelled a Portuguese football coach for insulting the country, a former colony of Portugal.Diamantino Miranda, the coach of the Costa do Sol club in the capital, Maputo, must leave by Saturday.Last month, he was recorded saying that Mozambicans were "a bunch of thieves" after he disputed a refereeing decision.He has apologised and cried at a press conference announcing his expulsion.The coach said he did not realise at first when making the comments that he was talking to a journalist - and that his words had been recorded.In an emotional speech at a press conference called by Costa do Sol, one of the country's biggest teams, he said that he held the Mozambican people close to his heart."I hope that the truth will be restored and that one day I will return to Mozambique," Portugal's Publico newspaper quoted him as saying.Mr Miranda's remarks were made after Costa do Sol lost 1-2 to Vilanculos last month."All here are thieves. You are all a bunch of thieves, you and other journalists can be bought off with a bowl of soup. This country is not serious," he was recorded as saying.Costa do Sol's management said they disagreed with the expulsion and felt it unfair.The club received Ms Taipo's expulsion letter on Thursday, which gave Mr Miranda 48 hours to leave the country.Her letter said he showed "a lack of respect, civility and consideration of the values enshrined in the constitution of the republic as well as legislation in force in our country", Mozambique's O Pais newspaper reports.Some 250,000 Portuguese left Mozambique after independence in 1975, but many are now seeking employment opportunities in the former colony, which has one of the world's fastest-growing economies, in contrast to Portugal.</body>

      <title>Kerry in Afghanistan for key talks</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry begins talks in Afghanistan, which are expected to focus on a stalled security agreement between the two nations.</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has begun talks in Afghanistan, which are expected to focus on a stalled security agreement between the two nations.Mr Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai are discussing the deal which would allow the presence of US troops after the 2014 Nato troop withdrawal.But disagreements remain over key issues, including how much the US would defend Afghanistan if it is attacked.Mr Karzai has accused Nato of failing to bring stability to Afghanistan."On the security front the entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure," he told the BBC Newsnight earlier this week.Mr Kerry began talks with his Afghan counterpart shortly after arriving on an unannounced visit to Kabul on Friday.Washington wants the deal done before Afghanistan's presidential election campaign opens next month."(US) President (Barack) Obama and President Karzai reaffirmed both back in January that the goal here was to complete the BSA (Bilateral Security Agreement) in October," a US state department official travelling with Mr Kerry was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency."Uncertainty about an incomplete BSA could erode the resolve among Nato allies, makes (it) more difficult to plan for the US," the official said.But there is deadlock over how much the US would defend Afghanistan if it is attacked, with Washington not wanting to be committed to defending the mountain passes of the east against infiltration from Pakistan.Meanwhile, Kabul wants an end to raids on its soil and is demanding that the US hand over intelligence instead.During his visit Mr Kerry will hope to bridge what looks like a wide gap between the two sides, the BBC's Afghanistan correspondent David Loyn reports.But he adds that US officials are now talking about the possibility of a "zero option" - no troops in Afghanistan after the end of 2014.Mr Karzai told the BBC's Newsnight this week that he was in no hurry to sign a pact."If the agreement doesn't suit us then of course they can leave. The agreement has to suit Afghanistan's interests and purposes. If it doesn't suit us and if it doesn't suit them then naturally we will go separate ways."He also claimed that Nato had incorrectly focused the fight on Afghan villages rather than Taliban safe havens in Pakistan.Mr Karzai has had troubled relations with his Western backers in recent years for openly criticising Nato, whom he has accused of having no respect for Afghan sovereignty.He is concerned about his legacy, not wanting to be remembered for losing Afghan sovereignty, our correspondent adds.</body>

      <title>Spain probes Hu Jintao 'genocide'</title>

      <body>Spain's top criminal court has decided to hear a case brought by Tibetan rights activists who allege that China's former President Hu Jintao committed genocide in Tibet.Judges ruled that they were competent to handle the case because one of the activists, Tibetan monk Thubten Wangchen, is a Spanish citizen.Hu Jintao was the Communist Party leader in Tibet in 1988-1992, when Chinese troops quelled mass protests.China imposed martial law in Tibet.The remote mountainous territory is an autonomous region ruled by Beijing.In their lawsuit against Hu Jintao the Madrid-based Tibetan Support Committee allege that as Communist leader in the region he was ultimately responsible for actions "aimed at eliminating the uniqueness and existence of Tibet as a country, imposing martial law, carrying out forced deportations, mass sterilisation campaigns, torture of dissidents".The Spanish legal system recognises the universal justice principle, under which genocide suspects can be put on trial outside their home country. But for Spain to hold the trial there is a requirement that at least one victim of alleged genocide must be a Spanish citizen.Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over Tibet, but many Tibetans remain loyal to the exiled Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. He is seen by his followers as a living god, but by China as a separatist threat.Genocide, the gravest crime against humanity, is understood to mean actions aimed at the mass extermination of a whole group of people.</body>

      <body>The head of the Catholic Church in Germany is to raise with Pope Francis a row over a bishop accused of lavish spending and lying under oath.Archbishop Robert Zollitsch said he would meet the pontiff next week to discuss the Bishop of Limburg, Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst.German prosecutors want to fine the bishop for making false affidavits. The bishop has made no immediate comment.Pope Francis has preached frugality since taking office in March.The bishop's name has been plastered across German newspapers all week, the Germany's international broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.There were calls for his resignation after it emerged that the cost of his new residence in Limburg, a town in Hesse near Frankfurt-on-Main, had run to 31m euros (£26m; $42m), more than six times the original estimate.Then, on Thursday, state prosecutors in Hamburg said the bishop had twice lied under oath about a flight he took to India on a trip to visit poor children.He had filed a civil court claim against Der Spiegel magazine, which is based in the northern city, for reporting that he had flown first class on the trip.After being forced to print a retraction, the magazine filed a legal complaint of its own. As evidence, it published mobile phone video (clip in German) of its interview with Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, in which he clearly stated that he had flown business class.Asked by the German daily Bild about the high cost of his new residence, the bishop said: "I understand that the high cost of 31m euros sounds frightening. Those who know me know that I don't have a pompous lifestyle."Archbishop Zollitsch said he had set up a commission to investigate the finances of Limburg diocese."I'm not entitled to judge the request of the Hamburg state prosecutors or the Bishop of Limburg," he told reporters."I am sure that the bishop is dealing with this development thoroughly and with the necessary self-criticism".He said he would "speak to the Holy Father and the relevant people" about the issue in Rome next week.German Catholics pay a hefty compulsory tax to the Church, as part of their income tax, the BBC's Damien McGuinness reports from Berlin.Many are shocked by the allegations of financial waste, which would go against the Pope's aspiration for Church leaders to live simply and modestly, our correspondent says.</body>

      <body>A car bomb has exploded outside the Swedish consulate in Libya's second largest city of Benghazi, with no reported casualties, officials say.The front of the building and nearby houses were damaged in the attack in the upscale district of Fuwayhat.The Swedish mission - one of the few diplomatic offices in Benghazi - was empty during the attack.It is the latest in a series of attacks on foreign embassies as Libya struggles to deal with lawlessness since 2011.The car bomb was detonated by remote control on Friday, according to officials.No staff were injured in the attack as the embassy is usually closed on Fridays, says Swedish foreign ministry spokesman Ursula Ahlen.It comes a day after Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was seized from a Tripoli hotel and briefly held by armed militiamen for undisclosed reasons.Earlier this month, staff from the Russian embassy were evacuated after gunmen attacked its compound in Tripoli.A car bomb was also found outside the Italian embassy in June and the UK withdrew some embassy staff in May over security concerns.The most serious incident occurred last year, when US ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, alongside three other US officials.</body>

      <body>Thirteen inmates have been killed and at least 30 injured in a fight between rival gangs in a prison in Brazil.Riot police say they have regained control of Pedrinhas prison in Sao Luis, in the state of Maranhao, and are searching the jail for illegal weapons.Prison guards said fighting had broken out after they discovered inmates digging an escape tunnel.Brazilian prisons suffer from extreme overcrowding and riots and gang warfare are not unusual.The riot started after guards received a tip-off that 60 inmates were digging a tunnel through which they were planning to escape at dawn, Maranhao state security secretary Aluisio Mendes said."When the guards tried to access the cell in which the entrance to the tunnel was located, the prisoners tried to fight them off," he added.Prisoners started a fire and members of rival gangs took advantage of the confusion to settle scores, officials said.Relatives of inmates gathered outside the prison complex demanding information and threw stones at the guards.Several buses were also set alight by the relatives, local media reported.Pedrinhas is notorious for its gang warfare. Earlier this month, three inmates were killed, one of them decapitated.Another was electrocuted when he got entangled in cables used to light an escape tunnel last month.Brazil's Minister of Justice, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, said last year that Brazil had "a medieval prison system, which not only violates human rights [but] does not allow for the most important element of a penal sanction, which is social reintegration".Officials say that despite building new prisons they have not been able to keep pace with the increasing number of detainees, making it hard for them to improve conditions within the jails.</body>

      <title>UN sued over Haiti cholera epidemic</title>
      <description>The UN faces a claim for compensation by victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti, which victims' lawyers say was caused by peacekeepers.</description>

      <date>1381331536</date>
      <body>Lawyers representing victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti have filed a lawsuit against the United Nations at a court in New York.They say UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010. The disease killed more than 8,000 people and made hundreds of thousands sick.The lawyers are demanding compensation of $100,000 (£62,000) for every person who died and $50,000 for each of those who became ill.The UN says it has legal immunity.Lawyers filed the suit at the US District Court in New York. They said they were left with no other option after the UN had rejected previous claims for compensation."The UN refused to even consider them. We then felt we had no choice but to file in a national court," Brian Concannon, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which is bringing the case, told the BBC.BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle says investigations have pointed strongly to leaking sewage at a camp for UN soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, as the origin of the outbreak in Haiti.No cases of the bacterial infection, which causes diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramps, had been recorded in Haiti for a century until the outbreak in late 2010.Then cases mounted quickly in an area near the camp.Leading cholera expert Danielle Lantagne, who once worked for the UN, said in the past that the outbreak's "most likely source" was the UN camp.In February, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the petition for compensation was "not receivable" under a 1947 convention which grants the UN immunity for its actions.Our correspondent says the UN's position is unlikely to change.</body>

      <body>Rebel forces in Syria killed as many as 190 civilians and seized more than 200 hostages during a military offensive in August, Human Rights Watch says.A report by the US-based group says the deaths occurred in villages inhabited predominantly by members of President Bashar al-Assad's minority Alawite sect near the coastal city of Latakia.It said the findings "strongly suggest" crimes against humanity were committed.The group has previously documented atrocities by pro-government forces.The report calls on the UN to impose an arms embargo on all groups where there is credible evidence of their involvement in war crimes.Human Rights Watch says it conducted an on-site investigation in September and interviewed more than 30 people, including survivors and combatants on both sides.Its 105-page report says that in the early hours of 4 August fighters from several different rebel groups attacked and overran army positions in the Sheikh Nabhan area of the Latakia countryside. A soldier told HRW that about 30 of his comrades were killed in the assault.The rebels then entered the Alawite villages of Barouda, Nbeiteh, al-Hamboushieh, Blouta, Abu Makkeh, Beyt Shakouhi, Aramo, Bremseh, Esterbeh, Obeen, and Kharata."Eight survivors and witnesses described how opposition forces executed residents and opened fire on civilians, sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack, and at other times killing adult male family members, and holding the female relatives and children hostage," the report says.The report names 190 civilians killed by the rebels, including at least 57 women, 18 children and 14 elderly men. The total number of dead is likely higher because many residents remained missing and bodies were buried in mass graves, it adds.Opposition sources say the women and children taken hostage in the attack are still being held. Relatives said many appeared in the background of a video published online.HRW says about 20 opposition groups took part in the offensive and that five were involved in the attacks on civilians - the al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), Jaysh al-Muhajirin wa al-Ansar, Ahrar al-Sham and Suqour al-Izz.None are affiliated to the Western-backed Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army, though SMC chief Gen Salim Idris did say at the time that fighters under his command participated in the assault.The report says ISIS and Jaysh al-Muhajirin are holding the hostages.The government launched an offensive to retake the Sheikh Nabhan area on 5 August, ultimately regaining full control on 18 August.Joe Stork, acting Middle East director at HRW, said the abuses were "not the actions of rogue fighters"."This operation was a co-ordinated, planned attack on the civilian population in these Alawite villages," he said.The report says evidence including witness statements and a review of hospital records showed rebels executed or unlawfully killed at least 67 of the 190 dead civilians who were identified. For the remainder, further investigations are required.A doctor at a hospital in Latakia said several of the bodies had multiple gunshot wounds, stab wounds or had been decapitated. Some were burnt or had their feet bound, he added.The report says the high civilian death toll and the nature of the recorded wounds "indicate that opposition forces either intentionally or indiscriminately killed most of the remaining victims"."The evidence strongly suggests that the killings, hostage taking, and other abuses committed by opposition forces on and after August 4 rise to the level of crimes against humanity."HRW says Islamist rebel groups - which include foreign fighters - are financed by individuals in Kuwait and the Gulf. It calls on the UN to impose an arms embargo on all groups credibly accused of war crimes.The organisation has also accused Syrian government forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country's 31-month long conflict, most recently in a chemical weapons attack in several suburbs of the capital, Damascus, on 21 August.Western nations blamed government forces for the attack, in which hundreds died, but President Assad said rebel fighters were responsible.Experts from the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), are currently overseeing efforts to destroy weapons production equipment in Syria.Earlier this year, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, called on the UN Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC).She said it "would send a clear message to both the government and the opposition that there will be consequences for their actions".More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN.</body>

      <description>Israeli forces detain five Palestinians after an Israeli man is beaten to death at his home in the occupied West Bank.</description>

      <body>Israeli forces have detained five Palestinians after an Israeli man was beaten to death at his home in the occupied West Bank.Sraya Ofer, a retired colonel, was killed after going to investigate noises coming from his garden in the northern Jordan Valley, police say.His wife was injured but escaped and raise the alarm. Checkpoints were set up as security forces scoured the area.Israeli media say the couple had been attacked with iron bars and axes.Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Peter Lerner said the Palestinians had been detained in an investigation "focused on intelligence".The attack took place at around 01:00 (22:00 GMT) at Brosh Habiqa resort, part of the West Bank settlement of Shadmot Mehola.The woman, who escaped through a security fence, told police the attackers were Palestinians.The incident happened in a part of the Jordan Valley which Israel captured in the war of 1967 where the construction of Israeli homes and businesses is widely considered a breach of international law - something Israel does not accept, says the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Jerusalem.The dead man is the third Israeli to be killed in what Israel characterises as "terror attacks" in the last month in the West Bank. Two serving soldiers have also died.Israel security officials quoted in the local media have not appeared to detect a pattern in the sudden increase in the level of violence, but at least one right-wing member of the cabinet has said Israel should respond by ending peace talks with the Palestinians, our correspondent adds.</body>

      <title>Latest US debt crisis talks 'useful'</title>
      <description>US Republicans and the White House say latest talks to avert a looming debt crisis were useful, but they break up without agreement.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24483014</url>
      <date>1381502469</date>
      <body>Republicans in the US House of Representatives and President Barack Obama have met amid efforts to avert a looming debt crisis.Both sides said the 90-minute discussion was useful but no decision was made. They agreed to keep talking.Republicans have offered the president a short-term debt limit increase to stave off default.A new survey suggests the majority of Americans blame the Republicans for the partial shutdown of government.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests 53% of Americans fault Republicans for the crisis, compared with 31% who say the Democrats are responsible."It was a very adult conversation," said Republican Hal Rogers of Thursday afternoon's meeting. "Both sides said they were there in good faith."House Majority leader Eric Cantor called the meeting "very useful" and said the talks were continuing.Mr Obama planned a late Friday morning White House meeting with Republican senators, who said they would present options of their own for ending the budget standoff.Officials have warned the US risks default on 17 October if the nation's $16.7 trillion (£10.5 trillion) borrowing limit is not increased.Republicans have offered to extend the government's borrowing authority beyond the deadline, temporarily putting off a default.In return they want Mr Obama to negotiate on the budget dispute that has partially closed the government - the first such shutdown for 17 years.Earlier, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said: "It's time for leadership. It's time for these negotiations and this conversation to begin."A spokesman for Mr Boehner told reporters the deal offered was a "clean" increase of the debt limit, with no additional policies attached, lasting six weeks - until 22 November.But it is not clear if Republicans are willing to drop entirely their attempts to defund or delay Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare law.Reacting to the offer, White House press secretary Jay Carney told a daily press briefing the president was glad that "cooler heads" seemed to be prevailing in the House.But he added: "He will not pay ransom in exchange for the Republicans in the House doing their job."Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the Senate would "look at anything" the House sent to them, but they would not engage in negotiations with Republicans prior to reopening the government.Rattled US stock markets rebounded on Thursday on news of a possible breakthrough.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been out of work since the shutdown began, and private firms, from arms makers to motels, have begun to lay off workers.About 15,000 private-sector employees have filed for unemployment benefits due to the shutdown, the US labour department said on Thursday.And governors in at least four western states - Utah, South Dakota, Arizona and Colorado - have asked for authority to reopen national parks within their borders because of the economic impact of the closures.On Thursday, Mr Obama signed legislation restoring death benefits to families of US troops who have died since the government closed. The shutdown prevented processing of the payments, typically made within days of the soldier's death.The president met House Democrats at the White House on Wednesday and told them he would prefer a longer-term increase to the nation's debt ceiling, but was willing to accept a short-term fix.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told a Senate hearing that skipping a payment on US debt would trigger financial crisis"chaos".Since the US hit its debt ceiling in May, the treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, Mr Lew has said.</body>

      <title>Coroner denies Ohio captor sex death</title>
      <description>A coroner says there were no signs auto-erotic asphyxiation played in a role in the hanging of Ohio captor, Ariel Castro.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24487839</url>
      <date>1381485849</date>
      <body>The coroner who classified the death of Ohio captor Ariel Castro as a suicide says there were no signs he had been choking himself for sexual pleasure.It follows a state prison report that suggested his death by hanging last month may not have been suicide.It said he was found partially naked in his cell and hinted at accidental death by auto-erotic asphyxiation.Castro was beginning a life sentence for imprisoning, raping and torturing three women in his home for ten years.Details of his death were published by the Ohio Department for Rehabilitation and Correction on Thursday.According to the findings, Castro was found "hanging from a hinge in the window of his cell by a sheet wrapped around his neck. His pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles".The convict left no suicide note.The report said Castro's intentions were unclear, however the facts had been "relayed to the Ohio State Highway Patrol for consideration of the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation" - the act of restricting air supply for sexual pleasure.But Franklin County coroner Jan Gorniak said there were no signs Castro had been sexually stimulated, speaking in a statement to media on Thursday."That's why I called it a hanging suicide," she is quoted as saying by the Plain Dealer newspaper.She suggested his trousers and underwear may have simply fallen down while he was hanging and was not enough evidence to back up the idea of auto-erotic asphyxiation.Ms Gorniak said she had not been consulted by anyone involved in the report over the possible cause of death.The report also found that prison guards had faked logs about their monitoring of Ariel Castro in the hours before he killed himself.Officials found video footage indicating that two guards failed to make checks at least eight times on that day.Castro was supposed to have been checked by guards in his isolation cell in Orient, Ohio, every 30 minutes.The 53-year-old was taken off suicide watch in June after authorities determined he was not at risk of taking his own life.His lawyer, Craig Weintraub, told reporters last month that Castro had been denied permission to receive independent counselling despite previously contemplating suicide and that he was likely to suffer depression after his sentence.The former school bus driver was sentenced in August to life imprisonment without parole plus 1,000 years for the abduction of Michelle Knight, 32, Amanda Berry, 27, and Gina DeJesus, 23, from the Cleveland streets between 2002-04.The three women escaped from Castro's home on 6 May.In an interview soon after his conviction, Castro's lawyers said that he fit the profile of someone with a sociopathic disorder.</body>

      <title>A list for living, not a bucket list</title>
      <description>What 50 experiences would you want before you died?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477163</url>
      <date>1381454569</date>
      <body>Many people now make bucket lists. The BBC's Helen Fawkes explores the experiences people want before they die, and her own "list for living".What would you do if you found out that your time was limited? If you were told that you could be dead within months, you certainly had no more than five years to live?Well, that's the situation which I'm facing. On Christmas Eve last year I found out that I had incurable ovarian cancer. I felt waves of shock, sadness and anger. But I also knew that once I'd come to terms with the devastating news, I was going to make the most of the time I had left.A few days before the diagnosis, as I waited for one of many medical appointments, I thought about the things I might never do. I started to write down some of the stuff in my reporter's notebook. This was the start of my bucket list.Getting a dog, exploring the ancient ruins in Rome, taking a speed boat down the Thames, having my book published, learning to play poker and seeing penguins in the South Pole are just some of the 50 things I want to do.This has become known as a bucket list because it's all the things you want to achieve before you kick the bucket. But I don't like the term. I'd rather focus on the living, not the dying. I prefer to call it my "list for living".This cancer business is so horrific that it can easily take over your identity. Having this gives you something else to focus on and makes you feel like you again. So far I've managed to do 10 of them. I've pulled a pint in my local pub, I went to Paris with a group of friends just for lunch, modelled in a fashion show and zoomed down a zip wire. Next weekend I will present a Radio 4 programme, Pick of the Week, which will mean another big tick.But what's most important to me is right at the top of the list - move to the countryside and live in my own house. This is also what I wrote down in my notepad while I waited at hospital back in the winter. A couple of months ago I finally got my own home in a village. It needs lots of work to coax it out of the 1980s but once its done I'll be able to live there. It's an incredible feeling doing something I've wanted for years.I'm not sure I'll ever get to do everything on my bucket list but Susan Spencer-Wendel, from Florida, is someone who has. Susan is terminally ill with ALS, or motor neurone disease, an incurable condition which destroys the nerves that power her muscles.Susan realised that she had around a year left of relatively good health so she went on all the trips she wanted to with her loved ones. This included going to see the Northern Lights with her best friend and wedding dress shopping in New York with her teenage daughter - something she knew she'd never get to do for real.Susan wrote about her story in Until I say Goodbye: My Year of Living with Joy - A book she tapped out on an iPhone using just one thumb. She told me that her joy came from getting the best possible outcome from the worst of circumstances."I discovered the depth of love I have for the people around me and the depth of love they have for me. I discovered friends I never knew I had. And this lifts me each and every hour."Just like Susan, my list for living is about taking back some control. When you're told that you could die soon, many of your future plans are shattered. Life revolves around tests, treatments and trying desperately to feel well.My bucket list has given me some kind of a structure. There are no excuses anymore. You have to get on and do things rather than thinking you must do it someday. It's almost like giving pleasure a priority, in doing so you create powerful memories. I have one friend who must have spent hundreds of hours at hospital with me so it was really special to be able to do something totally unconnected with cancer and go glass-blowing.My list for living has made me realise that when I'm taking part in something I enjoy I feel so much better. It gives me a real boost. In May, I went to see Stonehenge at sunrise with a friend. As soon as I stood inside the ancient stone circle it was like my chemo fog lifted.For a magical hour, just the two of us watched night turn into day. As we left, the spell was broken. Not long afterwards I felt so chronically ill that I was barely able to walk.This was near to the end of some very toxic treatment. What helped to get me through it all was my plan to recover afterwards on a ridiculously perfect beach. It was so chilly and wet at times that I needed my coat but I had a blissful time in Cornwall. It was number five on my list so this shows you how badly I wanted the holiday. It's so vital to have something to look forward to. I may be fighting a killer disease but I still need some hope in my life.I used to be very sporty and I still crave that adrenalin rush so I picked a few things like sky diving and swimming with sharks just because they would terrify me. I haven't yet been brave enough to do those. But I have been driven very fast around a racetrack. A friend arranged for the ex-Formula 1 star David Coulthard to drive me around Silverstone. The speed was so exhilarating that I couldn't even scream to start with. It's funny how being scared to death can make you feel so alive.One of the reasons I responded to my diagnosis with a bucket list was because of a book I'd recently read, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. Bronnie Ware looked after terminally ill people in Australia. She realised that many of them shared the same concerns. For example, they wished they hadn't worked so hard and they'd allowed themselves to be happy.When I interviewed Bronnie for my documentary she told me that one of her favourite clients was a woman called Grace. She always wanted to travel but didn't because of her husband."She was a lady who spent her life in a very unhappy, dominating marriage. Her husband went into a nursing home because he was ill. She then became terminally ill within a few weeks of gaining the freedom that she had waited 50 or 60 years for. So she actually never got to live any of those dreams and she insisted on me promising her that I would live a life true to myself," Bronnie explained.I'm glad that I don't have any big regrets. This is partly down to another bucket list that I made. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with cancer for the very first time. While I was ill from the evil chemo cocktails I couldn't do anything but think about what I wanted to do once I was well again. I came up with a list of 10 things. Within weeks of finishing treatment I was in Moscow, pursuing my dream of becoming a BBC foreign correspondent.I'm clearly a fan of bucket lists but I understand that they're not for everyone. I wonder whether they create too much pressure to try to cram in everything? Psychotherapist Philippa Perry is worried that some people may have one for the wrong reasons."My first reaction is to think of it in terms of a shopping list. It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It's not about being alive, it's about going through the motions."My aim is not just to have things to tick off but to be left with a whole load of special memories with the people who mean the most to me. I know that when I'm dying and I'm too sick to do anything else they will be at my bedside reminding me about our adventures.Like the time we went to Paris.

      <title>When Danger Mouse ruled the roost</title>
      <description>David Jason finds out what happened to Cosgrove Hall</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24429892</url>
      <date>1381457414</date>
      <body>Thirty years ago children's cartoon Danger Mouse topped the TV ratings, beating even Coronation Street. But what happened to the legendary Manchester animation house Cosgrove Hall Films, which created the rodent secret agent?Voiced by Only Fools And Horses star David Jason, Danger Mouse was the flagship of Cosgrove Hall Films, based in a quirky studio in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy.Vibrant, surreal and deliciously silly, an astonishing 21 million viewers tuned in to watch it in 1983, a record for a children's programme which has yet to be beaten."I used to race home from school to watch it and tape it," remembers comedian Natalie Haynes. "Then I'd watch the tape over and over again."For other people, there was Top of The Pops, for me there was Danger Mouse. If I had kids, I'd be scared to try and introduce them to Danger Mouse, because what if they didn't like it? I could put up with them being noisy and making a mess, but if they didn't like Danger Mouse, I'd hate them."Danger Mouse - who was joined by bumbling sidekick Penfold, voiced by comic actor Terry Scott, as he took on the evil Baron Silas Greenback - has been shown in more than 80 countries.A curiously British cartoon, it parodied James Bond and was influenced by Monty Python's anarchic humour.The titular hero literally lived down the street from Sherlock Holmes - his lair was underneath a post box next to 221b Baker Street.The show's co-creators Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall say the show was modelled on Patrick McGoohan's 1960s TV show Danger Man.In 2006, Hall told the BBC why he thought Danger Mouse was so successful: "The adults watched because of that kind of anarchy. The kids watched it because they just loved the stories and the absolutely stupid gags."Haynes agrees: "Danger Mouse is based on that purely British humour, like Monty Python, that so lacks any of that London-based cosmopolitan pomposity."The people that made it just set out to make kids laugh. It's just the joyous, innocence of the jokes that I love."Things like the Scottish character called Mac the Fork, who's a snake with a forked tongue and who has a brother called Mac the Spoon, and then there's another character called 'Dudley Poison', why wouldn't you enjoy them?"As for the permanently-terrified Penfold, Cosgrove says: "Mark said to me, 'You know what you've done, don't you? You've drawn your brother'. And bless him he was right. It was pretty close."My brother always wore a suit and he was bald and he wore heavy-rimmed glasses. He worked at the Sunday Express in Manchester and they all started calling him Penfold," chuckles the animator.Danger Mouse was the first international hit for Cosgrove Hall, whose animated series also included Count Duckula; Jamie and the Magic Torch; The Wind in the Willows and Cockleshell Bay.The animation studio was a breeding ground for some of Britain's best animators, says Professor Paul Wells, director of the animation academy at Loughborough University,"One of the most important things about Cosgrove Hall is that they really established Manchester as an important centre for British animation production and of course they spawned other companies like Mackinnon and Saunders (The Corpse Bride) and really helped with the careers of internationally renowned animators like Barry Purves."Purves, who later worked at Aardman Animations, and then on Peter Jackson's King Kong movie, says: "From animators I know at Pixar and Disney... many of them have a great fondness, particularly for Danger Mouse, and they very much enjoy its Monty Python, Goodie-esque type silly, surreal British sense of humour"I know they have it in the back of their minds when they are thinking of their own gags."He also recalls an incident when the Israeli embassy complained about another Cosgrove Hall series, Chorlton and the Wheelies.Brian Trueman, who wrote the script, explains: "We were accused of anti-Semitism because (the witch) Fenella Fellorick had a German talking spell book."On the front of the spell book it should have the magic symbol of witchcraft, the pentagram. But the guy who was making the model found that doing two triangles overlaid on one another was a lot easier to make so he slapped the Star of David on the front of it."He giggles as he remembers: "That brought claims that it was an anti-Semitic show. I think they were reassured that it was absolutely nothing of the kind."Cosgrove Hall's back catalogue also includes Roald Dahl's The BFG; Engie Benjy; and Kenny Everett's animated space adventure Captain Kremmen; as well as several animated episodes of Doctor Who.But Danger Mouse remains its most enduring character.Sir David Jason created his voice, imbuing the masked rodent with a high-handed manner that turned the most innocent of phrases - "Good grief!" - into an instant catchphrase.He also played the show's narrator, a character in his own right who became increasingly exasperated with having to say "meanwhile" as he linked the show's scenes.Sir David, now 73, says: "I was first attracted to Danger Mouse by the standard of character animation - I feel very fortunate to have been a part of the creative process of these two fantastic animators."For their adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, I was originally cast as Rat but I really felt that I wanted to offer them a different take on Toad."As manipulative as he was, I always felt that Toad must have a softer side in order to attract such nice friends and so I tried to make him more of a loveable rogue. Brian and Mark listened to my interpretation and thankfully agreed that I should play Toad instead."We always had such a successful working relationship coupled with such fun which we hope came through in the various animations we made together."Sir David is not the only famous alumnus of the studio - Bernard Sumner of Joy Division and New Order worked there from 1976 to 1979; while The Stone Roses guitarist, John Squire, made models for The Wind In The Willows.The company ran into trouble in 1991 when its parent company Thames Television lost its London ITV franchise and was forced to sell it off.Anglia TV bought Cosgrove Hall but it retained only a handful of staff, and began to shift its emphasis.Chris Bowman, a former executive producer, says they began to create animation for other TV productions, like Postman Pat; Fifi and the Flowertots; and Roary the Racing Car, and saw "a second golden age".They were also entrusted by the BBC to make updated versions of Noddy, Andy Pandy and Bill and Ben.Professor Wells says: "They weren't frightened of taking what you might call iconic children's entertainment vehicles like Bill and Ben and remaking them."The company also created the BBC's first cartoon webcast and made the animated ushers who greeted visitors to the Millennium Dome exhibition in London.In 2008, ITV decided to pull the plug on Cosgrove Hall and sell off its studios.Professor Wells says the company was a bit slow to react to the multi-channel world and the growth in imports of US cartoons like Ren and Stimpy.Those "were a little more excessive, a little more adult, looking at a teenage crossover market, and Cosgrove Hall didn't react efficiently enough."When the old Cosgrove Hall studios in Chorlton closed in 2010 dozens of former workers, including Purves, turned up to say goodbye.Hall died of cancer, in 2011, aged 74.By then the studios had been demolished, to make way for retirement flats.But it appears the story is not quite over.Last month, it was announced that Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Entertainment was moving into a business park in Didsbury, Manchester, and taking on 40 animators and graphic designers, with plans for a further 70 jobs.Listen to Crikey DM!

      <description>Acts of kindness provide glimmers in US shutdown gloom</description>

      <body>Thousands of workers sent home, cancer patients denied new drugs and weddings postponed. But the way some individuals have responded to chunks of the US government closing down has lifted the spirits, says Tom Geoghegan.The sight of Chris Cox pushing a lawnmower across Washington's National Mall, a chainsaw hanging from it, was one that warmed the heart of many."If they shut down our memorials, we're still going to take the trash out, we're going to clean the windows, we're going to cut the grass, we're going to pull the weeds, we're going to do the tree work,'' he told a Washington radio station.Cox, who made the trip from South Carolina and was carrying the state flag, says his "memorial militia" crusade was non-political, merely an attempt to keep the area between the Lincoln and World War II memorials tidy before thousands of veterans are due to attend an event on Sunday.His wasn't the only act of altruism to emerge from the wreckage of the partial shutdown. On the same day, the military charity Fisher House announced that it would pay more than $500,000 (£313,000) to cover the death benefits denied to five bereaved families. And a philanthropist billionaire has thrown a lifeline to a pre-school education programme called Head Start, to the tune of $10m.When Adam Brown and Joy Miller learned that their wedding venue in Yosemite National Park was off-limits, a caterer in San Francisco stepped in to supply food while other businesses provided a venue and all the trimmings. "We feel so blessed and honoured that strangers have given so much to make our wedding a reality," Miller told CNN.People all around the world act more altruistically for the common good in times of emergency, says moral philosopher Peter Singer, in circumstances that range from something like this to war and famine. But philanthropy has a strong tradition in the US and there's something distinctly American about the idea that individuals can take over the functions of government."Like the guy mowing the lawn in Washington, the idea that somehow people can step in and you don't really need government, you can do it by charity," he says.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Profile: Chemical weapons watchdog OPCW</title>
      <description>The winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize</description>

      <body>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an independent international body set up in 1997 to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention.The organisation is currently involved in destroying Syria's stockpiles of chemical weapons - the first time the OPCW has worked in a war zone.The OPCW has been awarded the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to stop chemical warfare.It carries out inspections of destruction procedures, as well as evaluating members' own declarations, in order to verify that the convention is being adhered to.It is based in The Hague and has 189 member states, covering around 98% of the world's population, it says. These member nations have agreed to work together to create a world free from chemical weapons.The OPCW employs around 500 people and in 2010 had a budget of 75m euros ($102m, £63m).It is an autonomous organisation with a working relationship with the United Nations.In early October, the head of the organisation, Ahmet Uzumcu, called for a ceasefire in Syria to enable it to destroy the country's stockpiles. He said the deadline for the destruction, under the terms of a UN resolution, was "very tight".An inspections team came under sniper fire in Syria on 26 August, but there have been no reported attacks on inspectors since.The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was adopted by the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva in September 1992.Under its terms the OPCW stringently verifies whether member nations are complying with the CWC.The CWC aims to totally eliminate chemical weapons as a class, and part of the OPCW's mission is to prevent the re-emergence of chemical weapons in a country which has signed up.Egypt, Angola, North Korea and South Sudan are not members of the OPCW.Israel and Burma, also known as Mynamar have signed but not ratified the CWC so are also non-members.Somalia joined in June 2013 and Syria is due to officially become a member shortly.The US and Russia are committed to destroying their arsenals of chemical weapons under the terms of the CWC, but missed a 2012 deadline to complete this process.They were criticised by the Norwegian Nobel committee in their announcement on Friday for missing the deadline.The OPCW says Albania, India and a third country - widely believed to be South Korea - have completed the destruction of their declared chemical weapons.In Libya and Iraq, as well as Syria, Russia and the US, the destruction is ongoing.</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478942</url>
      <date>1381417427</date>
      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <title>Vitamin D 'no effect' on the healthy</title>
      <description>Healthy adults do not need to take vitamin D supplements, suggests a study in The Lancet which found they had no beneficial effect on bone density, a sign of osteoporosis.</description>

      <body>Healthy adults do not need to take vitamin D supplements, suggests a study in The Lancet which found they had no beneficial effect on bone density, a sign of osteoporosis.But experts say many other factors could be at play and people should not stop taking supplements.University of Auckland researchers analysed 23 studies involving more than 4,000 healthy people.The UK government recommends children and over-65s take a daily supplement.The New Zealand research team conducted a meta-analysis of all randomised trials examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density in healthy adults up to July 2012.The supplements were taken for an average of two years by the study participants.Bone mineral density is a measure of bone strength and measures the amount of bone mineral present at different sites in the body. It is often seen as an indicator for the risk of osteoporosis, which can lead to an increased risk of fracture.The trials took place in a number of different countries including the UK, the US, Australia, Holland, Finland and Norway.Although the results did not identify any benefits for people who took vitamin D, they did find a small but statistically significant increase in bone density at the neck of the femur near the hip joint.According to the authors, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.Prof Ian Reid, lead study author, from the University of Auckland, said the findings showed that healthy adults did not need to take vitamin D supplements."Our data suggest that the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare."Writing about the study in The Lancet, Clifford J Rosen from the Maine Medical Research Institute agrees that science's understanding of vitamin D supports the findings for healthy adults, but not for everyone."Supplementation to prevent osteoporosis in healthy adults is not warranted. However, maintenance of vitamin D stores in the elderly combined with sufficient dietary calcium intake remains an effective approach for prevention of hip fractures."The Department of Health currently recommends that a daily supplement of vitamin D of 10 micrograms (0.01mg) should be taken by pregnant and breastfeeding women and people over 65, while babies aged six months to five years should take vitamin drops containing 7 to 8.5 micrograms (0.007-0.0085mg) per day.Dr Laura Tripkovic, research fellow in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Surrey, said the study was important but very specific."I'm not surprised they didn't find any evidence of the effects of vitamin D on bone density because there are so many other factors involved in osteoporosis, like genes, diet and environment."To pin it all on vitamin D... it's difficult to do that."Dr Tripkovic said it was no good taking vitamin D supplements if people didn't also maintain a healthy, balanced diet containing calcium and take plenty of exercise.She said most healthy people should be able to absorb enough vitamin D naturally, through sunshine and diet."But if people are worried about their vitamin D levels then a multi-vitamin tablet would do. If you have bone pain and muscle aches then you should go and see your GP and discuss it."We get most of our vitamin D from sunlight on our skin, but it is also found in certain foods like oily fish, eggs and breakfast cereals.However, taking too much vitamin D in the form of supplements can be harmful because calcium can build up and damage the kidneys.Experts advise taking no more than 25 micrograms (0.025mg) a day.The UK guidance is currently being reviewed.</body>

      <title>Total gay blood ban 'is irrational'</title>
      <description>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge rules</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24494371</url>
      <date>1381502282</date>
      <body>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge has ruled.He also held that Health Minister Edwin Poots breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive.The judge gave the verdict in a challenge brought by an unidentified homosexual man.The complete ban, put in place during the 1980s, was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.It was replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago.The 12-month deferral was left in place following a Government Advisory Committee report.It identified a much shorter period during which infection with blood-borne viruses could not be detected.Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety.But a gay man granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability launched a judicial review challenge to Mr Poots' position on blood donation.The judge heard claims that the minister displayed apparent bias that went beyond religious beliefs and into the realms of prejudice.It was revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.Attorney General John Larkin QC, the chief legal adviser to the Stormont Executive, questioned the legitimacy of the challenge.He claimed the challenge was a waste of time because the applicant had previously had sex for money.Mr Larkin rejected arguments that the issue required full executive approval and questioned whether the minister had made a decision to maintain the current ban.However, the judge said that in continuing the lifetime deferral policy the minister had deviated from the position taken in England, Scotland and Wales.He said the decision was made against the secretary of state's recommendation that the report from the advisory committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) should be followed.The judge held that the additional risk from deferring donation for 12 months, instead of permanently, was very minimal.He said: "The minister has decided that MSM (males who have sex with other males) behaviour creates such a high risk of infection to the donor that such donors must be permanently deferred with the result that such blood cannot enter the Northern Ireland blood stock."Importing blood from other places which do accept MSM donors, even in limited quantities, leaves the door open for MSM blood to do just that."There is clearly a defect in reason here."Applying different standards to imported blood defeats the whole purpose of a permanent deferral, he added.Declaring the decision irrational, he said: "If there is a genuine concern about the safety of MSM donated blood such that the blood stock must be protected absolutely from such blood then the security of that blood must actually be maintained absolutely."Dealing with the alleged breach of the ministerial code, the judge said the lifetime ban was both controversial and cross-cutting, taking in equality issues."As such the minister had no authority to act without bringing them to the attention of the Executive Committee which he failed to do."In doing so the minister breached the ministerial code and... had no legal authority to take a decision in breach of the ministerial code."</body>

      <title>Kissing the key to finding Mr Darcy</title>
      <description>Kissing helps us assess potential partners if, like a Jane Austen heroine, we cannot wait forever for Mr Darcy to come long, a study suggests.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478245</url>
      <date>1381449173</date>
      <body>Kissing helps us assess potential partners if, like a Jane Austen heroine, we cannot wait forever for Mr Darcy to come along, a study suggests.Scientists believe kissing helps people judge the quality of a potential mate through taste, smell and fitness.Once in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around.Women were found to value kissing more highly in long-term relationships.An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly.This suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says.Professor Robin Dunbar, from the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said courtship in humans was complex and involved a whole series of assessments before men and women decided to carry on their relationship."Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in."In choosing partners, we have to deal with the 'Jane Austen problem': How long do you wait for Mr Darcy to come along when you can't wait forever and there may be lots of you waiting just for him? At what point do you have to compromise for the curate?"Prof Dunbar said that Jane Austen, whose works of romantic fiction included Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, realised that people were extremely good at assessing where they were in the "mating market" and pitching their demands accordingly."It depends what kind of poker hand you've been dealt."If you have a strong bidding hand, you can afford to be much more demanding and choosy when it comes to prospective mates," he said,If kissing plays a part in selecting a partner then it also plays an important role before sex in short relationships and at a range of different times in committed relationships, the study found.The study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships.This may be because it plays a role in increasing feelings of affection and attachment among couples, the researchers suggest.Previous research had found that women placed greater value on activities that strengthen long-term relationships because being pregnant and raising children is easier when two parents are present.In another study in Human Nature, researchers from Oxford suggest that women's attitude to romantic kissing also depends on where in their menstrual cycle and their relationship they are.Women valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.</body>

      <title>'Get flu vaccine this winter' plea</title>
      <description>People at most risk from flu this winter should make sure they get vaccinated against the virus, says Public Health England.</description>

      <body>People at most risk from flu this winter should make sure they get vaccinated against the virus, says Public Health England.For the first time, a nasal spray vaccine is being offered to all two- and three-year-old children because they are key "spreaders" of the virus.People over 65, adults and children with long-term health conditions and pregnant women are known to be at risk.Around 800 people were admitted to intensive care with flu last year.A national advertising campaign is being launched by Public Health England to encourage parents of two- to three-year-old children, and other at-risk groups, to take up the offer of a vaccination.This follows research which found that young children's close contact with each other means they are more likely to transmit the virus to other vulnerable people, such as babies and elderly people.The national flu vaccination programme should eventually include annual vaccination of all two- to 16-year-olds.At present the government says it would not be effective for the NHS to vaccinate every healthy person against flu. However people can still pay for the flu vaccine at their local pharmacy.Every each winter hundreds of thousands of people see their GP and tens of thousands are hospitalised because of flu.Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer, said being protected against flu was vital for certain groups of people."Severe winter flu and its complications can make people really ill and can kill - you are eleven times more likely to die from flu if you are in a clinical at-risk group."I urge everyone who is eligible to get the vaccine and help protect themselves and their families this winter."Dr Paul Cosford, medical director and director for health protection at PHE, said flu was unpleasant for the majority of people but could be life-threatening for others."It can be very serious for older people and those groups at risk of developing complications including people with weakened immune systems, as well as those with underlying conditions such as neurological disorders, liver, lung or renal disease, heart problems or diabetes, and pregnant women."Vaccination remains the best way to protect against the potential serious harm from flu this winter."For information on how to get vaccinated, contact your local GP surgery.</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's find is 'turning point'</title>
      <description>A chemical which can stop brain cell death in a neurodegenerative disease could hold the key for treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases, scientists say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24462699</url>
      <date>1381395409</date>
      <body>The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the "turning point" in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other diseases.In tests on mice, the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented.Prof Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimer's was not imminent but: "I'm very excited, it's the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration."The world won't change tomorrow, but this is a landmark study."The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, based at the University of Leicester, focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells.When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a build-up of viral proteins. Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.However, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or "misfolded" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.This process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.However, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: "They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary."What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first."This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start."She said the compound offered a "new pathway that may well give protective drugs" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.Prof Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.Side effects are an issue. The compound also acted on the pancreas, meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight.Any human drug would need to act only on the brain. However, this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point.David Allsop, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as "very dramatic and highly encouraging" but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage."It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."</body>

      <title>Plaid's pledge to cut energy bills</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, addressing the party conference, announces plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24457978</url>
      <date>1381503345</date>
      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has announced plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.Energy Wales would buy gas and electricity at wholesale prices and sell direct to consumers and firms, she told the Aberystwyth conference.Surpluses would be spit between protecting customers and expanding energy efficiency measures.Ms Wood said the firm would work as an arms-length company like Welsh Water."When Labour's energy price freeze begins to thaw and prices begin to spike again, Plaid Cymru would have enabled the building of our cheaper, permanent, people-powered Welsh alternative," she said.In her second annual conference speech since being elected party leader, she said Plaid would recruit 1,000 extra doctors if it won the assembly election in 2016.This would be financed by a sugary drink levy of up to 20p per litre, she said.She also announced radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales over the next assembly term.Ms Wood also announced an "alternative way forward" on hospital reorganisation plans.Labour has accused her of blocking a controversial shake-up of some specialist services without suggesting alternatives.Welsh Labour ministers have insisted closing some hospitals and moving some core services from smaller to larger hospitals are essential to make the NHS safe and sustainable.Some of the most controversial have been in south Wales, with opposition to proposals to move key specialist care from Llantrisant's Royal Glamorgan hospital as part of changes at five health boards.Ms Wood said Plaid was committed to delivering a better Welsh NHS with 1,000 extra doctors."We will provide more doctors so these services can stay open and stay safe," she said.Money would be raised by levy of up to 20p a litre on sugary drinks."If a thousand extra doctors sounds over-ambitious consider this."With them, Wales would only be brought up to the UK average - so we must have those extra doctors."She told party members this would help provide a more efficient NHS, as would plans to better integrate hospitals and social care "to get patients out of hospital and back into their own home".The Plaid leader said funding to begin this integration had already been won as part of a package of measures the party had this week announced with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers in a deal on the Welsh budget.Ms Wood said there was a "crisis of obesity and diabetes that was killing us as a nation."She also unveiled radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales, over the next assembly term.Plaid has said previously Wales can learn from how Norway, Germany and Denmark have offered modern hospital care without centralisation.The party has argued planning the NHS workforce more effectively and better recruitment practices would help reduce some of the strains on the health service.Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru was the only party addressing people's big concerns at the 2016 assembly election and that "Wales is better than this".Ms Wood started her speech by saying Plaid would build on recent momentum.She said this would "carry us forward over the finishing line" to win the assembly election in 2016."It isn't a sprint but a marathon and I'm firing the starting pistol here today."She said she was committed to Plaid being the next government of Wales "so we can build Wales up, turn around the economic situation, stand on our own two feet."Plaid Cymru also points to the budget deal it signed with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers earlier in the week which put more money into treating patients in the community as a way of both improving services and keeping more patients out of hospital.All party members who attend the two-day conference will be able to vote on the motions debated. Until now that was reserved for delegates representing various sections of the party.The change is part of internal reforms brought in following Plaid Cymru's disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election.Ms Wood promoted plans to cut business rates for smaller firms on the opening day of the two-day Aberystwyth event.Firms would qualify for reduced business rates if their rateable values was below £15,000, rather than £12,000 under the current regime.A rateable value below £10,000 would mean paying no business rates, rather than the £6,000 ceiling at present.Ms Wood has also defended her party's election performances since devolution.With the SNP in government in Scotland, she was asked on BBC Radio Wales why the Scottish nationalists had moved so much further on than Plaid."I think it reflects the different settlement that Wales has had compared to Scotland," said Ms Wood."Scotland is so much further ahead in terms of the devolution settlement and Wales is in a different place."Our settlement is much weaker as is our economic situation and that's why I've said since I've become the leader of Plaid Cymru that the economy and job creation should be our number one priority."I would argue that Scotland has got a government that puts Scotland first and Scottish communities first at every opportunity and Wales needs a government now that will do that and I would argue that a Plaid Cymru government after 2016 is what the country needs now."SNP MP Pete Wishart urged Plaid activists to join in with the campaign.To enthusiastic applause, he told the conference: "We will win, because independence is the aspiration...that puts the future of Scotland in the hands of the people who live and work in Scotland."</body>

      <title>NHS 'must seek saving ideas abroad'</title>
      <description>The NHS in England has to look to India and Mexico for saving ideas - or face a large funding shortfall, its regulator says.</description>

      <date>1381366030</date>
      <body>The NHS in England has to look abroad for new ideas - or face a large funding shortfall by the start of the next decade, a health regulator has said.Monitor said the NHS was only likely to reach two-thirds of its £30bn saving target by 2021 if it kept on as it was.Most savings so far have come from keeping wages low and improving productivity.But the regulator said the NHS should be more radical by borrowing ideas from countries such as India and Mexico.Monitor's report cites Aravind Eye Care which runs a network of cataract clinics across India.The report said: "By streamlining the workflow of care to maximise the use of staff skills, Aravind is able to perform 60% of the number of NHS cataract surgeries but at one-sixth of the cost to the NHS and achieve better clinical outcomes."Another scheme highlighted was Medicall Home in Mexico which is a nurse telephone advice service that has had great success in reducing the need for consultations with local doctors."If the NHS were to introduce a similar service and it reduced 50% of first visits to general practice, where patients would otherwise have seen a doctor, we estimate it could free up GP time worth in the region of £0.6bn to £0.8bn, taking into account the cost of nurses to run the phone service," stated the report.Other schemes highlighted include one in Ghana for capturing patient information and images on a mobile phone and sending them "for interpretation by a doctor at a different location".Monitor said using fresh ideas such as these could help the NHS meet its ambitious savings targets.Over recent years the NHS has been working towards saving £15-20bn by 2015 - the so-called "Nicholson challenge".But it is now becoming accepted that the savings drive will need to be extended beyond that and hence a £30bn figure has been put forward for 2021.Monitor chief executive David Bennett said he agreed with that but claimed the combination of wage restraint, productivity improvements and reconfiguration of hospitals services was only likely to save around two-thirds of that and so fresh ideas were needed.He said that could either be achieved by getting new providers from abroad into the NHS to compete or by getting NHS trusts to adopt their ideas.He added: "We are not going to make the numbers add up if we don't have this sort of innovation."We must not rule out letting players outside the NHS from coming in and showing us how to do things differently."British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter questioned how easy it would be to adopt ideas from abroad."Doctors would need to see more detail as to how the changes proposed would work in reality," he said.But he added it was clear the continuing funding crisis meant doctors had to be given the "freedom" to innovate.Monitor, set up in 2004, describes itself as "the sector regulator for health services in England". It exercises a range of regulatory powers under different acts of parliament.</body>

      <title>Depression risk 'starts in the womb'</title>
      <description>Children whose mothers are depressed during pregnancy have a small increased risk of depression themselves, according to a UK study.</description>

      <date>1381372281</date>
      <body>Children whose mothers are depressed during pregnancy have a small increased risk of depression in adulthood, according to a UK study.Medical treatment during pregnancy could lower the risk of future mental health problems in the child, say researchers at Bristol University.The study followed the offspring of more than 8,000 mothers who had postnatal or antenatal depression.The risk is around 1.3 times higher than normal at age 18, it found.The study is published in JAMA Psychiatry. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Pearson told the BBC: "Depression in pregnancy should be taken seriously and treated in pregnancy. It looks like there is a long-term risk to the child, although it is small."She said it was an association, not a causal link, and needed further investigation.Prof Carmine Pariante of King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry said the development of an individual's mental health did not start at birth but in the uterus."The message is clear - helping women who are depressed in pregnancy will not only alleviate their suffering but also the suffering of the next generation."Prof Celso Arango of Gregorio Maranon General University Hospital, Madrid, said stress hormones may affect the child's development in the womb."Women with depression would ideally be treated before getting pregnant, but if they are already pregnant when diagnosed with depression it is even more important that they are treated as it will impact on the mother and child."The researchers think different factors may be involved in antenatal and postnatal depression, with environmental factors such as social support having a bigger impact in postnatal depression.The data comes from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - a long-term health research project, also known as Children of the 90s.More than 14,000 mothers enrolled during pregnancy in 1991 and 1992, and the health and development of their children has been followed in detail since then.</body>

      <body>Northern Ireland's health minister is to meet the Public Prosecution Service over potential prosecutions of health care staff involved in abortions.Edwin Poots has also offered to meet a couple whose unborn twins have a serious abnormality.The babies' mother had urged Mr Poots to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.Mr Poots said: "The circumstances in this case are being fully explored from a legal perspective."The woman, who wanted to be named only as Laura has been told her girls have anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality.She is 22 weeks pregnant. Foetal abnormality is not a ground for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Laura said she felt "let down by her country" at having to leave to have the abortion."I'm not going to be near my family, I'm not going to have any of my family's support," she told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show."I have a hard enough thing to go through at the minute, finding out I have twin girls with the same condition who are going to have absolutely no outcome of life whatsoever."To make that decision in the first place (to have an abortion) was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make in my life."I think it's horrendous the fact that I have to go to a different country where I don't know anybody and have to go through something like that."Laura said she only found out she was expecting twins after her five-month scan; the next day she found out they had anencephaly and would have "absolutely no form of life whatsoever"."I don't think I could ever go full term and have them in your arms for a couple of hours and have to watch them pass away is just something I don't think I could cope with," she said."They only have a heartbeat, that's all they have, the only thing that's keeping them alive is me."She said there was also a strong chance the babies would die in the womb.The twins' father, Chris, added: "We would like to be given the option, like any family in our position, to get the treatment that we require in our own country and have our families around us."In a statement, Mr Poots said: "This couple have my deepest sympathy. This is an extremely traumatic time for them and I want to be assured that they are receiving all the support and care that they need."I can offer my assurances that I will listen to the voices of those affected by such a difficult situation."I am willing to meet with this couple if they so wish and have asked my officials to contact them to offer a meeting."The issue of potential prosecutions for health care staff involved in abortion has been raised, and I will meet with the Public Prosecution Service to discuss this matter".On Wednesday, another woman, Sarah Ewart, contacted the Nolan Show to highlight her experience.She had to travel to England for an abortion because her baby was also diagnosed with anencephaly.On Thursday, Justice Minister David Ford said he was committed to bringing a paper to the Northern Ireland Executive looking at issues around the termination of pregnancy."That arose out of the previous issue on the discussion of the Marie Stopes clinic," he said."I have written to the minister of health suggesting it should be a joint paper, because there are issues of both criminal law and health and social care issues."It seems to me that what we've had highlighted yesterday and today is the need that we perhaps need to widen out that consultation to look at difficult issues like foetal abnormality to see if where the law is currently drawn is in the right place."</body>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients waiting more than nine months for hospital care.More than 13,000 in Wales had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of more than 2,000 in one month.Welsh Conservatives say First Minister Carwyn Jones should intervene personally in "an escalating crisis".Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the NHS in Wales had the same challenge as England but "where we differ is the way we respond and deal with these issues".The Welsh government has previously blamed the severe winter weather for pushing up the 36-week waiting time.Its own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives said they recognised the Welsh government had announced extra cash for the NHS in its draft budget announcement this week but waiting times remained "unacceptably long".Shadow health minister Darren Millar has written to Mr Jones saying the situation was "a crisis that needs immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."He added that he sought assurances the NHS delays would dealt with by Mr Jones personally.Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.Health Minster Mark Drakeford said: "We know there are significant challenges in the NHS. These are exactly the same challenges being faced by the NHS in England."Where we differ is the way we respond to and deal with these issues."As a result of our action, 92% of people in Wales are satisfied with the care they receive from the NHS."</body>

      <date>1381372584</date>
      <body>The self-esteem of teenage girls could be improved by training teachers to deliver classes in body image, a UK study shows.In the pilot study, 261 teenage girls at three secondary schools were given a course of six lessons on body image.This had significant effects on their body image and self-esteem compared with the regular curriculum, say psychologists at King's College London.As many as one in three teenagers say they are dissatisfied with their body.Poor body image has been associated with depression, eating disorders, overuse of cosmetic surgery, obesity and unhealthy weight loss behaviours.Dr Helen Sharpe and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry developed a course on positive body image for teenage girls.The six-part programme focused on ideals of beauty, unhealthy interactions with peers - such as "fat talking", or making negative comments about weight - and practical measures for boosting mood and self-esteem.The course was delivered by teachers in three state-funded girls' schools.Dr Sharpe told the BBC: "We have tested whether a series of lessons being delivered by teachers to students in school are helpful in improving body esteem - we found this was the case."She said the research, published in The British Journal of Psychiatry, showed promise in being able to tackle problems caused by low body esteem, such as eating disorders."We're hopeful that as we continue with this research we'll be able to make the programme even more effective and that it could then go on to be effective in reducing disordered eating - things like binge eating and unhelpful weight loss," said Dr Sharpe.Interventions delivered by teachers would have wide reach and be of minimal cost, said the researchers.Some schools were relying on programmes that were not evidence-based and could be harmful, they added.Last year, MPs recommended that all schoolchildren should take part in compulsory body image and self-esteem lessons.An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image heard evidence that more than half of the public had a negative body image.Girls as young as five now worried about how they looked, the MPs' report said, while cosmetic surgery rates had increased by nearly 20% since 2008.</body>

      <title>Madagascar bubonic plague warning</title>
      <description>Madagascar faces a bubonic plague epidemic unless it slows the spread of the disease, especially in its rat-infested prisons, aid groups warn.</description>

      <date>1381377616</date>
      <body>Madagascar faces a bubonic plague epidemic unless it slows the spread of the disease, experts have warned.The Red Cross and Pasteur Institute say inmates in the island's rat-infested jails are particularly at risk.The number of cases rises each October as hot humid weather attracts fleas, which transmit the disease from rats and other animals to humans.Madagascar had 256 plague cases and 60 deaths last year, the world's highest recorded number.Bubonic plague, known as the Black Death when it killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, is now rare.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva and the Pasteur Institute have worked with local health groups in Madagascar since February 2012 on a campaign to improve prison hygiene."If the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town. The prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town," said the institute's Christophe Rogier.The ICRC said the 3,000 inmates of Antanimora, the main prison in the heart of the capital Antananarivo, live with a huge rat population which spreads infected fleas through food supplies, bedding and clothing.The ICRC's Evaristo Oliviera said this could affect not only inmates and staff, but others they come into contact with."A prison is not a sealed place, first of all the staff themselves who work in the prison are at risk, and they go home at the end of the day, already perhaps being a vector of the disease," he told the BBC."Also the rats themselves, they can go in and out of the jail and also propagate the disease."And the prisoners do have visitors who can be also infected, and the prisoners eventually go out as well so we have many many ins and outs for the disease to spread."The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the eradication project undertaken by the ICRC is tricky because simply killing the rats is not enough.To prevent their infected fleas transferring to another host, possibly a human, the insects must be destroyed as well as the rodents, she says.Mr Oliviera said the disease could be treated with antibiotics if detected early, but a lack of facilities and traditional shame over the disease made this tricky in outlying parts of Madagascar.Experts say that Africa - especially Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo - accounts for more than 90% of cases worldwide.However in August a 15-year-old herder died in Kyrgyzstan of bubonic plague - the first case in the country in 30 years - officials saidDuring the last 20 years, at least three countries experienced outbreaks of human plague after dormant periods of about 30-50 years, experts say.These areas were India in 1994 and 2002, Indonesia in 1997 and Algeria in 2003.According to the World Health Organization, the last significant outbreak of bubonic plague was in Peru in 2010 when 12 people were found to have been infected.</body>

      <body>Lawyers representing victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti have filed a lawsuit against the United Nations at a court in New York.They say UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010. The disease killed more than 8,000 people and made hundreds of thousands sick.The lawyers are demanding compensation of $100,000 (£62,000) for every person who died and $50,000 for each of those who became ill.The UN says it has legal immunity.Lawyers filed the suit at the US District Court in New York. They said they were left with no other option after the UN had rejected previous claims for compensation."The UN refused to even consider them. We then felt we had no choice but to file in a national court," Brian Concannon, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which is bringing the case, told the BBC.BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle says investigations have pointed strongly to leaking sewage at a camp for UN soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, as the origin of the outbreak in Haiti.No cases of the bacterial infection, which causes diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramps, had been recorded in Haiti for a century until the outbreak in late 2010.Then cases mounted quickly in an area near the camp.Leading cholera expert Danielle Lantagne, who once worked for the UN, said in the past that the outbreak's "most likely source" was the UN camp.In February, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the petition for compensation was "not receivable" under a 1947 convention which grants the UN immunity for its actions.Our correspondent says the UN's position is unlikely to change.</body>

      <body>NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights, a new watchdog body says.Healthwatch England, which heads up a network of 152 local patient bodies, urged the public to become "savvy consumers" rather than "grateful patients".To help, the watchdog set out eight core rights for patients.It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in five had experienced poor care - but of those, 54% had not complained.Healthwatch England was created under the shake-up of the NHS earlier this year.It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients' champion, carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern.This is its first report to Parliament, and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers, insisting on our right to safe, dignified and high quality care."To help achieve that, the organisation has set out its list of rights:Ms Bradley added: "Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street, but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system."Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative."Without real and meaningful input from patients, it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future," he added.</body>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <title>HMRC 'failed' on tobacco smuggling</title>
      <description>MPs warn that HM Revenue and Customs initiatives to fight tobacco smuggling are not working.</description>

      <date>1381394576</date>
      <body>MPs have warned that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) initiatives to fight tobacco smuggling are not working.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the UK economy lost £1.9bn a year through tobacco smuggling, equal to 20% of all tax collected on cigarettes.Some tobacco firms oversupply other European countries and the surplus enters the UK tax-free, the PAC said.The HMRC says it has more than halved the size of the illicit market in cigarettes.But the PAC report said the HMRC was "in the dark" about how effective its enforcement strategy was.PAC chair Margaret Hodge said she was concerned that three out of five new HMRC initiatives to tackle smuggling had produced nothing by March 2013."The Department and Border Force have been painfully slow in taking forward new proposals to improve performance," she said.She added the two government agencies had failed to make a realistic assessment of what could be achieved and by when.Ms Hodge also said the HMRC had "failed to challenge properly those UK tobacco manufacturers who turn a blind eye to the avoidance of UK tax by supplying more of their products to European countries than the legitimate market in those countries could possibly require"."The tobacco then finds its way back into the UK market without tax being paid," she added. "The supply of some brands of hand-rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240%."HMRC must be more assertive with these manufacturers. So far it has not fined a single one of them," she said.An HMRC spokesman said the customs body had more than halved the size of the illicit cigarette market, highlighting the seizure of nearly 3.6bn cigarettes and more than 1,000 tonnes of rolling tobacco since 2011."Disrupting criminal businesses is at the heart of HMRC's strategy to clamp down on this illicit trade," he said."The tobacco smuggling gangs are constantly adapting to the huge downward pressure HMRC puts them under. This pressure has caused the long-term decline of this illegal trade."</body>

      <title>Plane noise 'link' to heart disease</title>
      <description>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas which have a lot of aircraft noise, researchers have found.</description>

      <date>1381277391</date>
      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <description>The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust faces a large fine after it pleaded guilty to safety breaches over the death of a diabetic patient.</description>

      <body>The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust is facing a large fine after it pleaded guilty to safety breaches over the death of a diabetic patient.Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital in April 2007 after two nurses failed to give her insulin.Ann King was struck off and Jeannette Coulson was cautioned after a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found them guilty of misconduct in July.The trust will be sentenced at Stafford Crown Court at a later date.It had pleaded guilty at Stafford Magistrates' Court to failing to properly manage and organise hospital services including its systems for record keeping and sharing patient information between staff members.Magistrates ruled their sentencing powers for the offence were insufficient because they could only impose a maximum fine of £20,000.They decided the trust should be sentenced at the Crown Court, where it will face an unlimited fine.Chairman of the bench Ian Jones told the court: "The defendant's actions fell well short of the expected standards over a substantial period of time."The bench have considered both the public interest arguments and the financial arguments put forward."The court heard that the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust was running an annual operating deficit of about £11m.It became the first foundation trust to go into administration in April.The NHS Litigation Authority, which provides indemnity cover for legal claims against NHS Trusts, said Mid Staffordshire's insurance would not cover a fine from the HSE.It said it would have to find the money from its own budget.Ms Astbury, from Hednesford, Staffordshire, died after going into a diabetic coma on 11 April 2007 while being treated for fractures to her arm and pelvis.In a statement released after the hearing, her full-time carer Ron Street said the prosecution afforded a "small measure of justice to Gillian."He said: "The financial fine of the trust is not the issue, as whatever the level of the fine it will only hinder the hospital which is otherwise trying to get back on its feet."My overwhelming concern is that the senior members of the trust board, who were responsible for implementing this system of unsafe work at the hospital whilst Gillian was in their care, have never been held to account."Today's acknowledgement of guilt by the trust does little by way of justice against those individuals who permitted such unsafe practices to continue for so long."The criminal prosecution was brought by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) three years after an inquest jury ruled that Ms Astbury's death was caused by low staffing levels and a failure to provide adequate nursing facilities.The inquest also found that the failure by nurses to administer insulin amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care.Peter Galsworthy, from the HSE, said Ms Astbury's death was "entirely preventable".He said: "The trust's failure to implement a robust and consistent process cost the life of a vulnerable patient in the trust's care....and it will now be for a Crown Court judge to determine sentence."The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust said it "fully accepted the decision" to refer the case to the higher court.Chief Executive Maggie Oldham said: "Our thoughts remain with the friends and family of Gillian Astbury and we apologise for the dreadful care Ms Astbury received at Stafford Hospital in April 2007."Although of little consolation to Ms Astbury's family, we can assure them we have done everything we can to put those things right which went so very wrong in 2007 and that the standard of care now provided at the hospital has improved considerably over the last few years as has been recognised by many independent organisations and individuals."</body>

      <body>"Ancient humans" used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth has revealed.A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia - the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.Writing in PNAS, the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth.The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors.Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been, but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles, or jaws.Ani Margvelashvili, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual's age."Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species," she told BBC News."The individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this area, if you place a toothpick it goes through."The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world.The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa."It's not very often you have one site with four mandibles. It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before," explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum.This included horizontal scratches on a lesion, visible on the root surface of one of the teeth."Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species. Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics. It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is," Prof Lordkipanidze, co-author of the work, told BBC News.It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were. Experts once believed it was Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tall-standing and big-brained H. erectus. Instead, the Dmanisi individuals were short, long-armed, small-brained and thin browed. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum, London, said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania."This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation."Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas, US, said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils."Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period, but this clinical, forensic approach is new and potentially useful."Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been more-or-less limited to anatomically modern humans, and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology," Prof Ungar added.</body>

      <title>Microscopic 'bacterial zoos' made</title>
      <description>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages has been built out of jelly by US researchers.</description>

      <date>1381194157</date>
      <body>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages built out of jelly has been constructed by US scientists.Their findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could transform understanding of how bacteria behave in communities.The bugs have different properties, which can make infections hard to treat, when they form colonies.UK researchers said bacterial communities were poorly understood and the technology could lead to progress.Big groups of bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance where lone bacteria would be vulnerable. The nature of a community can affect how serious an infection becomes in open wounds or in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis.Scientists have been growing bacteria in Petri dishes in the laboratory for more than a century.But they do not replicate all the conditions inside the body and they cannot be used to manually build colonies of bacteria, one bacterium at a time.A team of researchers at the University of Texas have used 3D printing to build colonies.They mixed bacteria with a special form of gelatin and let it set so the bacteria were suspended like cocktail fruit in jelly.They then fired a laser at the gelatin-bacteria mix.The structure of the gelatin was altered at the point the laser beam was focused. The targeted gelatin proteins hooked up to each other so that when the rest of the gelatin was washed away it left the "cage".It allowed the researchers to build cages around individual, or small groups of bacteria in whatever shape they chose. By building up a number of cages, they could eventually build a "zoo", with every bacterium exactly where the researchers wanted it.The walls of the cage were able to keep the bacteria in place, but allow nutrients and signals to pass between cages.Prof Jason Shear, from the University of Texas, said experiments had shown that one species of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, could become more antibiotic resistant when growing with another Pseudomonas aeruginosa.He told the BBC that the new technology could start to tackle questions about bacterial communities: "If a cluster develops antibiotic resistance, how large does it have to be, how many cells, what density is needed, is a low oxygen environment key?"We're starting to see that it really does matter how cells arrange themselves, it affects how antibiotic resistant a colony is, so it may ultimately inform therapies."Prof Ross Fitzgerald, from the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: "I think it is safe to say we know very little about bacterial communities."There are millions of bacteria in the gut, but we don't know much about how they function or relate to each other and infectious diseases are often caused by more than one pathogen, co-infection is more common that we'd thought in the past."I think this technology does provide an opportunity to simulate better in the laboratory various bacterial communities that can be present in an infection."</body>

      <title>Does reality TV help the NHS?</title>
      <description>Fly-on-the wall TV programmes may not be showing us the real National Health Service, warns Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23687320</url>
      <date>1376622383</date>
      <body>Reality TV finds its way into all areas of our lives - including our hospitals. In this week's Scrubbing Up column, Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, asks if the picture it reflects is distorting our idea of how the NHS works.There has been an increasing range of reality shows focusing on NHS services in recent years: One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in AandE, Keeping Britain Alive, and Junior Doctors, to name just a few.These programmes provide amazing insights into the tireless work of NHS staff and the joys and heartaches of patients and their families.They show a health service that many of us as professionals are proud to work in and are determined to improve despite the increasing pressures on it, a service that is a source of great pride.But as more NHS reality shows appear on our screens, do they really give us a representative view of everything that the health service can and does do?In particular, is there too much fixation on the hospital model, the wonder services and miracle drugs breaking new barriers, and not enough on the care outside hospitals that provides just as essential a purpose?And does this bias the public's view of what we think the "right" kind of healthcare looks like, and inhibit our acceptance of change?The NHS is a complex system, and most of us would agree that many modern treatments are unrecognisable from the original service set up in 1948.Yet the very success of improving health outcomes for the postwar big killers is resulting in a new challenge - people living longer but developing more long-term diseases in older age.To meet these challenges we need to move the emphasis away from hospitals and towards community services.I fear that reality shows, as great as they are, may inadvertently reinforce the public view that hospitals, regardless of their standards, are best, without considering the alternatives.The reality is that hospitals are only one part of the modern NHS story.Many core health services may not have the TV wow factor of pioneering treatment carried out by our big teaching hospitals, or be as thrilling as the trauma care that saves lives in the most horrific of situations.But many community-based services are life-saving - such as falls services, which have been shown to reduce death rates by as much as by 50%.And although they are not glamorous they do save lives and, importantly, allow people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. After all, there is no place like home.Services such as these are a critical part of ensuring that people receive the right care.They relieve pressure on hospitals so those who do need treatment can be seen more quickly.And they reduce the likelihood of people having to stay in hospital because the support they need to be cared for at home or in the community is not there.We have seen how the pressures grow on our AandE departments when these other services are not available.Like any other industry, if the NHS is to retain its core purpose and principle - to meet the needs of everyone and remain free at the point of delivery - and in a safe affordable and sustainable way, it has to move with the times. And we need to let it do so.We have seen many improvements across a wide range of areas, with people spending less time in hospital, so it makes sense to have fewer hospital beds and more support in the community.Similarly, by concentrating the skill and expertise needed to deliver round-the-clock specialist care for patients, we are reducing the number of places it is allocated.By improving stroke services in London, care is now located at eight sites rather than 30 sites, with hundreds of lives - and money - saved each year.These changes may seem daunting, and I have no doubt the NHS needs to do more to engage the public in debate.Often we have not explained the benefits of change well enough.Instead, we have tended to engage with communities after we have come up with a preferred solution, and so have found ourselves in long, drawn-out battles over proposals deemed to be without proper foundation or evidence.So what, you might ask, does reality TV have to do with this?TV shows are there to entertain us, and we should not knock the opportunity to improve our knowledge and insight of various aspects of medicine.But TV also provides a useful mirror that reflects society - our prejudices, fears and hopes.And if our hope is to care for everyone in the right way and in the right place, TV needs to start reflecting that.The future I describe is already a reality in many parts of the NHS, but not evenly distributed.So how about a reality series looking at the amazing work that goes on in the community?After all, that is where life really happens. Is reality TV a help or hindrance to the NHS?</body>

      <title>App aims to improve death records</title>
      <description>How mobile phones are helping register deaths</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24164824</url>
      <date>1379723133</date>
      <body>Two thirds of deaths worldwide go completely unrecorded, making it impossible to know if public health money is being spent in the right places. But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478942</url>
      <date>1381417427</date>
      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <title>A list for living, not a bucket list</title>
      <description>Helen Fawkes explores 50 things she wants to do before she dies</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477163</url>
      <date>1381454569</date>
      <body>Many people now make bucket lists. The BBC's Helen Fawkes explores the experiences people want before they die, and her own "list for living".What would you do if you found out that your time was limited? If you were told that you could be dead within months, you certainly had no more than five years to live?Well, that's the situation which I'm facing. On Christmas Eve last year I found out that I had incurable ovarian cancer. I felt waves of shock, sadness and anger. But I also knew that once I'd come to terms with the devastating news, I was going to make the most of the time I had left.A few days before the diagnosis, as I waited for one of many medical appointments, I thought about the things I might never do. I started to write down some of the stuff in my reporter's notebook. This was the start of my bucket list.Getting a dog, exploring the ancient ruins in Rome, taking a speed boat down the Thames, having my book published, learning to play poker and seeing penguins in the South Pole are just some of the 50 things I want to do.This has become known as a bucket list because it's all the things you want to achieve before you kick the bucket. But I don't like the term. I'd rather focus on the living, not the dying. I prefer to call it my "list for living".This cancer business is so horrific that it can easily take over your identity. Having this gives you something else to focus on and makes you feel like you again. So far I've managed to do 10 of them. I've pulled a pint in my local pub, I went to Paris with a group of friends just for lunch, modelled in a fashion show and zoomed down a zip wire. Next weekend I will present a Radio 4 programme, Pick of the Week, which will mean another big tick.But what's most important to me is right at the top of the list - move to the countryside and live in my own house. This is also what I wrote down in my notepad while I waited at hospital back in the winter. A couple of months ago I finally got my own home in a village. It needs lots of work to coax it out of the 1980s but once its done I'll be able to live there. It's an incredible feeling doing something I've wanted for years.I'm not sure I'll ever get to do everything on my bucket list but Susan Spencer-Wendel, from Florida, is someone who has. Susan is terminally ill with ALS, or motor neurone disease, an incurable condition which destroys the nerves that power her muscles.Susan realised that she had around a year left of relatively good health so she went on all the trips she wanted to with her loved ones. This included going to see the Northern Lights with her best friend and wedding dress shopping in New York with her teenage daughter - something she knew she'd never get to do for real.Susan wrote about her story in Until I say Goodbye: My Year of Living with Joy - A book she tapped out on an iPhone using just one thumb. She told me that her joy came from getting the best possible outcome from the worst of circumstances."I discovered the depth of love I have for the people around me and the depth of love they have for me. I discovered friends I never knew I had. And this lifts me each and every hour."Just like Susan, my list for living is about taking back some control. When you're told that you could die soon, many of your future plans are shattered. Life revolves around tests, treatments and trying desperately to feel well.My bucket list has given me some kind of a structure. There are no excuses anymore. You have to get on and do things rather than thinking you must do it someday. It's almost like giving pleasure a priority, in doing so you create powerful memories. I have one friend who must have spent hundreds of hours at hospital with me so it was really special to be able to do something totally unconnected with cancer and go glass-blowing.My list for living has made me realise that when I'm taking part in something I enjoy I feel so much better. It gives me a real boost. In May, I went to see Stonehenge at sunrise with a friend. As soon as I stood inside the ancient stone circle it was like my chemo fog lifted.For a magical hour, just the two of us watched night turn into day. As we left, the spell was broken. Not long afterwards I felt so chronically ill that I was barely able to walk.This was near to the end of some very toxic treatment. What helped to get me through it all was my plan to recover afterwards on a ridiculously perfect beach. It was so chilly and wet at times that I needed my coat but I had a blissful time in Cornwall. It was number five on my list so this shows you how badly I wanted the holiday. It's so vital to have something to look forward to. I may be fighting a killer disease but I still need some hope in my life.I used to be very sporty and I still crave that adrenalin rush so I picked a few things like sky diving and swimming with sharks just because they would terrify me. I haven't yet been brave enough to do those. But I have been driven very fast around a racetrack. A friend arranged for the ex-Formula 1 star David Coulthard to drive me around Silverstone. The speed was so exhilarating that I couldn't even scream to start with. It's funny how being scared to death can make you feel so alive.One of the reasons I responded to my diagnosis with a bucket list was because of a book I'd recently read, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. Bronnie Ware looked after terminally ill people in Australia. She realised that many of them shared the same concerns. For example, they wished they hadn't worked so hard and they'd allowed themselves to be happy.When I interviewed Bronnie for my documentary she told me that one of her favourite clients was a woman called Grace. She always wanted to travel but didn't because of her husband."She was a lady who spent her life in a very unhappy, dominating marriage. Her husband went into a nursing home because he was ill. She then became terminally ill within a few weeks of gaining the freedom that she had waited 50 or 60 years for. So she actually never got to live any of those dreams and she insisted on me promising her that I would live a life true to myself," Bronnie explained.I'm glad that I don't have any big regrets. This is partly down to another bucket list that I made. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with cancer for the very first time. While I was ill from the evil chemo cocktails I couldn't do anything but think about what I wanted to do once I was well again. I came up with a list of 10 things. Within weeks of finishing treatment I was in Moscow, pursuing my dream of becoming a BBC foreign correspondent.I'm clearly a fan of bucket lists but I understand that they're not for everyone. I wonder whether they create too much pressure to try to cram in everything? Psychotherapist Philippa Perry is worried that some people may have one for the wrong reasons."My first reaction is to think of it in terms of a shopping list. It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It's not about being alive, it's about going through the motions."My aim is not just to have things to tick off but to be left with a whole load of special memories with the people who mean the most to me. I know that when I'm dying and I'm too sick to do anything else they will be at my bedside reminding me about our adventures.Like the time we went to Paris. How we ended up at a beautiful cocktail bar in the middle of the afternoon after a long lunch. Another customer remarked that we sounded like we were having a lot of fun and asked me what we were celebrating. After an embarrassing moment, I told her we were celebrating life.Helen's list for living: 1) Live in my own house (almost done), 2) Move to the country (almost done), 3) Get a dog, 4) Play a netball game, again, 5) Recover from chemo on a ridiculously perfect beach (done), 6) See penguins in the South Pole, 7) Go to Paris by Eurostar just for lunch (done), 8) Visit Pompeii and drive along the Amalfi coast, 9) Explore the ancient ruins in Rome, 10) Snorkel on a coral reef, 11) Trek in Nepal, 12) Go to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, 13) See the Northern Lights, 14) Ride a camel across a desert, 15) Drink a mojito in Cuba, 16) See Stonehenge at sunrise (Done), 17) Go into space, 18) Get married, 19) Get my book published, 20) Present a BBC Radio 4 programme, 21) Hold an exhibition of my cow photographs, 22) Do voluntary work, 23) Run a 5K, 24) Skydive, 25) Go gliding, 26) Ride a horse through Hyde Park, 27) Try kite surfing, 28) Zoom down a zip wire (done), 29) Surf somewhere hot, 30) Go coasteering somewhere cold, 31) Take a speed boat down the Thames, 32) Swing on a trapeze, 33) Fly in a hot air balloon, 34) Take a private jet over London, 35) Fly in a stealth airplane, 36) Be driven very fast around a race track in a sports car (done), 37) Sleep under the stars, 38) Get a tattoo, 39) Have a henna crown painted on my baldy head once the hair falls out, 40) Grow my hair long, again, 41) Be a model and work the catwalk (done), 42) Learn to play poker, 43) Pull a pint in a proper pub (done), 44) Hold a party in a castle, 45) Go glass-blowing (done), 46) See puffins in UK, 47) Swim with sharks, 48) Sail alongside a pod of dolphins at sea, 49) Catch fireflies in a jar, 50) Drink champagne in one of the best bars in the world just before Christmas to celebrate still being alive.Helen Fawkes shares her list for living on BBC World Service at 08:06 GMT (09:06 BST on) on Monday 14 OctoberFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</title>
      <description>Is there any scientific basis for drinking two litres of water a day?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24464774</url>
      <date>1381393552</date>
      <body>Drinking eight cups or two litres of water a day is longstanding advice. But is there any scientific basis for it, asks Dr Chris van Tulleken.You know those ads that remind us that even a small drop in hydration levels can massively affect performance so you need to keep hydrated with whatever brand of isotonic super drink they're selling?They seem pretty scientific don't they? Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.Well earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before (British Journal of Sports Medicine, September 2013, Current hydration guidelines are erroneous: dehydration does not impair exercise performance in the heat, Wall BA).This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after dehydration. So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.Then their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.So far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.This is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate psychological relationship with water consumption.Remarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to "drink to thirst" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.Perhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous. In simple terms, being too watery is as bad for you as being too concentrated.But what about the rest of us who aren't cycling around the desert in Western Australia?There is a very well accepted idea that we should drink about eight cups of water per day (two to three litres) in addition to our food and other drinks.We are awash with positive messages about the healing properties of water and how it will improve everything from our brains to our bowels. And we know that without it we will die in days.It's a short leap of logic to think that if a lack of water is bad for for you then hydration must be good - purifying, cleansing water washing through your organs must be beneficial, detoxifying. It surely improves your skin, helps you think, reduces your risk of kidney stones and turns your urine a lovely light, straw/champagne colour rather than the fetid orange syrup you produce at the end of a long day where you haven't had time to drink.So I've looked through the literature and I found a review article saying all of this and more. It was written by a group of respected physicians from American and French hospitals and it clearly supported the widely held belief that you should drink two to three litres of water a day.It said that people with a high urine output have a lower rate of kidney stone disease, that the flushing action of the water may reduce the risk of a urinary tract infection (especially in women after sex). Perhaps most importantly, they referenced a surprising study which showed that paradoxically an increased intake of water increased the risk of bladder cancer. But only tap water. And there's the clue.A footnote at the end of the article explained that what you thought was a scientific article in a scientific journal is in fact a supplement, sponsored by a major mineral water manufacturer. All of the authors received honoraria from this company, which also provided medical writing assistance. So this isn't research, it's marketing.And this is one of the reasons we're even discussing this - because increasingly drinking water doesn't just come out of our taps for free. It's sold to us by the same clever people that sell us yoghurts with bacteria in them that probably don't do us much good, something I look at separately in the television series I've been making. And these companies pretty consistently recommend two to three litres of water per day.So where did that number come from and is there any reason to think it correct?Well the grain of truth is this - people in temperate climates who are not doing sustained physical exercise do need around six to eight cups per day but that can be contained in food, alcohol or caffeinated beverages.Yes, beer and coffee do not dehydrate you to any noticeable extent (there's a nice paper where some medical students got to drink quite a lot of beer and had their urine studied - British Medical Journal (Clin Res Ed), December 1982, Acute biochemical responses to moderate beer drinking, Gill GV).There is no evidence that adding the eight cups of water to everything else you drink will do you any good and it could do you harm (American Journal of Physiological - Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, November 2002, Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Really? Is there scientific evidence for "8x8"? Valtin H).But the great thing is that just like a top-level athlete you don't need to worry about exactly what that total daily requirement is because your body will sort it all out for you.If you drink too much you pee it out. If you drink too little you get thirsty and pee less. It's all exquisitely well-controlled in the same way that your intake of oxygen is well-controlled.Saying that you should drink more water than your body asks for is like saying that you should consciously breathe more often than you feel like because if a little oxygen is good for you then more must be better.Like most things in life there's a Goldilocks amount - not too little and not too much. With this in mind, next week I'll deal with the health benefits of porridge and how to avoid being eaten by bears.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Does it matter why we help others?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24457645</url>
      <date>1381360309</date>
      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>How much can an extra hour's sleep change you?</title>
      <description>How much can a bit of extra sleep change you?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444634</url>
      <date>1381307042</date>
      <body>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the years.This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what caffeine is for - to jolt you back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen, rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours of sleep.The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina Wulff.The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be lost.You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that during the night my brain went through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep."This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. But the eye muscles are not paralysed, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain, noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It allows us to remain calm while our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional events.We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly, your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious. Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in your body.Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment. What we wanted to see was the effect switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or vice versa, would have on our volunteers.Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep, but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep."We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which were going up, and some which were going down."What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>What's behind the idea of banning 10-packs of cigarettes?</title>
      <description>Why are packs of 10 cigarettes being banned?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24441618</url>
      <date>1381251231</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to ban the sale of packs of 10 cigarettes as part of a general tightening of the law. Why?Public health campaigners are now focusing some of their effort on trying to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking.In the UK, cigarettes are commonly sold in shops in either packs of 10 or 20. But in much of the rest of the EU the smaller pack size is banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. Now, if the draft directive passes its final stages 10-packs will be illegal across the EU.The health campaigners describe packets of 10 as "kiddy packs" because they argue they are more affordable out of pocket money. Official figures estimate that 4% of children in England between the ages of 11-15 years old are smoking at least once a week."The thing we know about the pricing of cigarettes is that if the price is kept high through taxation that that works as a measure to help smokers to quit and also as a deterrent to young people," says Amanda Sandford research manager at Action on Smoking and Health (ASH)."If the minimum size of pack people can buy is 20 they are going to have to fork out at least £6 and £8 for a premium brand."The Republic of Ireland changed the law to make the minimum pack size 20 in 2007. Research in the run-up to the ban had suggested three-quarters of young people who smoked bought 10-packs.The number of smokers in the 10-17-year-old age group fell from 21.2% in 1998 to 18.6% in 2002, 15.3% in 2006 and 12% in 2010.But the 10-pack ban was just one of a catalogue of anti-smoking measures including a ban on in-store display and advertising, restrictions on self-service vending machines. Enhanced warnings on packets and higher prices came later.Tobacco industry-funded campaign group Forest, which describes itself as "the voice and friend of the smoker", says around two million people in the UK buy their cigarettes in packs of 10, because that's what they can afford, or they want to cut down. It argues that forcing people to buy bigger packets of 20 won't help reduce smoking.But campaigners argue that tobacco displays have used 10-packs prominently to make cigarettes seem cheaper, thereby drawing in younger smokers. A number of brands in the UK also sell 14-packs which again have been attacked by campaigners."Newsagents were stopped from selling single cigarettes many years ago by law because they are accessible to children," says Sandford. "A 10-pack is within the pocket money range."There is an argument that someone cutting down might be helped by the availability of smaller packs, but Sandford argues that smaller packs also provide an easier route for a lapsing person to return to smoking.Reporting by Branwen Jeffreys and Finlo Rohrer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414.</body>

      <title>Face blindness: Seeing but not seeing</title>
      <description>What is it like to live with face blindness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24385650</url>
      <date>1381047931</date>
      <body>Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother, your partner, your child. You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions.That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness.David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions."I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there," says David."But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her."David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them.He remembers when he realised there was a problem."I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways."On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: "'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'"What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. "My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality".After that, he discovered he was face blind.There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer.Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: "Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,."It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region."David said: "I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody".He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment."We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her."David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them.He now tells clients: "If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you."Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment.She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness.Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity."Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful," she says.She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind."If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who."I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces."But she says: "Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me."Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra.He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day,Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases.This condition has no cure. "In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem," he said."With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off."Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.Dr Jansari says: "Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!"</body>

      <title>Awake under the knife</title>
      <description>Can you be conscious but feel no pain under the knife?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24357476</url>
      <date>1380930754</date>
      <body>Having a general anaesthetic is a routine part of many operations. But what happens if you are still conscious after you close your eyes?You are in the operating theatre. Anaesthetic has been administered and the countdown to unconsciousness begins.For most people, the next thing they will remember is being roused from a deep sleep.But in a small minority of cases, complete unconsciousness never comes.Being awake during surgery and not being able to do anything about it is every patient's worst nightmare.But according to one of the country's leading anaesthetists, it may not be as simple as saying that someone is either asleep or awake.Prof Jaideep Pandit, consultant anaesthetist at the Oxford University Hospitals, believes there is an alternative "third state" of consciousness somewhere between sleeping and waking that patients under general anaesthetic can and do experience."I call it dysanaesthesia," he explains. "A type of awareness where the patient is aware of the surgery but is neither conscious nor unconscious."Despite being used around the world on a daily basis, no-one is exactly sure how a general anaesthetic acts upon the body.Anaesthesia is a complicated business requiring many years of training and a proper understanding of which drugs to give, and how much.However in general, a patient can be expected to receive an anaesthetic to make them unconscious and a painkiller to numb the pain.A specialist doctor will then monitor a whole host of measurements throughout the operation to make sure that the patient really is out for the count.Even so, in an estimated 1 in 15,000 surgeries patients experience what is known as accidental awareness where they remember aspects of their surgery after waking. Around a third of those will feel pain.The question whether someone is conscious or not is mind-bogglingly complex.But Professor Pandit is investigating something that goes one step further - a twilight state that lies between conscious and unconscious states - and one that his experiments show happens much more frequently than accidental awareness.He has been able to show this through the use of something known as the Isolated Forearm Technique.Before the advent of carefully calibrated monitoring equipment, anaesthetists were able to use this technique during surgery to check whether someone was fully unconscious.The method uses a tourniquet to prevent any muscle relaxants from paralysing the forearm. This means that if the patient becomes conscious during surgery, they can move their arm to alert the surgeon.Professor Pandit has used the technique to show some fascinating aspects to human awareness.In repeated tests, one third of patients who are seemingly unconscious are able to squeeze the experimenter's fingers on command using their non-paralysed forearm. But none of them will move spontaneously to show that they are awake or in pain during surgery."To all extents and purposes, these patients are unconscious," says Prof Pandit. "But they are clearly in a state where they can respond to some stimuli like verbal commands but not to others like the surgery, possibly because they are not distressed by it."According to Prof Pandit, this suggests there is a third level of consciousness.But analysing the concept remains extremely difficult."Mainly when patients come round they will have no recall of the event or if they do they do it's just vague memories. They're unable to remember anything with clarity," he told the BBC.One way doctors frequently explain general anaesthesia to patients is to compare it to being asleep. But that is technically inaccurate says Dr Emory Brown, a professor of anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School."What we need to do to safely and humanely operate on you - to perform a procedure which is indeed, very invasive and certainly traumatic - is to put you in a state which is a coma that we can readily reverse," he told the BBC.This coma-like condition potentially protects the patient from pain and memory of the surgery. But it also helps the surgeons to operate by keeping the patient still and maintaining bodily functions at a stable level.However, what's happening in the brain as it slips from conscious into unconsciousness is still uncertain.In 2011, a research team at Manchester University were able to watch for the first time the effects on a human brain as it lost consciousness under anaesthetic.Using a novel method of brain imaging, they were able to construct real-time 3D images of the brain - rather than the 2D slices of standard brain scans.It enabled them to see how electrical activity in the brain changed as the patients went under.Interestingly, activity in the brain appeared to hot up as the patient became unconscious. This suggests that rather than switching off, the brain works hard to dampen down or inhibit consciousness while they are under the influence of anaesthetic.But scientists are still a long way off from understanding the impact on the brain as unconsciousness occurs."We are still unable at this time to define what human consciousness is, so trying to find a box of tricks that's going to monitor its absence is difficult," says Dr Kevin Fong, a consultant in anaesthesia at University College London Hospitals."But awareness during anaesthesia is something we've learnt to guard against through layers and layers of monitoring. We check surrogates of awareness such as heart rate, blood pressure and rates of respiration, and also constantly monitor the exact concentration of drugs in the blood."Indeed having memory of your surgery is one of the most important complications that both anaesthetists and patients wish to avoid.Although a national survey this year found the risk of waking up under the knife was extremely low, the effects for patients who do experience it can be acutely traumatic.For Prof Pandit, the ultimate aim of understanding human unconsciousness is to prevent such episodes from occurring."The risk of experiencing pain or distress during accidental awareness is very low at around 1 in 45,000," he explains. "But when it does happen it can have a very bad effect on the individual.""So it's not just the numbers that are driving us to research dysanaesthesia, but also the impact."</body>

      <title>Clegg and Cable 'split' over leaks</title>
      <description>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.</description>

      <body>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.Mr Cable said the newspaper performed a "very considerable public service" by publishing details of documents leaked by Edward Snowden.But Mr Clegg reaffirmed his belief it was "not good at all" and said the information could "help terrorists".Downing Street said the security services' review system works well.A spokesman, however, said the prime minister is ready to listen to ideas for improving the system.He was speaking as Mr Cable also called for "proper political oversight of the intelligence services".Earlier, Sir David Omand, a UK security expert and former No 10 advisor described the leaks by Mr Snowden as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".In May, Mr Snowden leaked information to the Guardian about mass surveillance programmes such as the US National Security Agency's Prism and GCHQ's Tempora operations.The Guardian has defended its decision to publish documents leaked by the former US intelligence worker, who was granted asylum in Russia, and has vowed to publish more.Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4' Today programme: "I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service."I think Mr Snowden's contribution is two-fold. One is a positive one - the whistleblowing - the other is more worrying which is a large amount of genuinely important intelligence material does seem to have been passed across."We do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now."But Mr Clegg told the BBC: "My view is that publishing information, technical information which can help terrorists work out how to do harm to us, of course, that is not good at all."But of course there is a legitimate, wider debate, an ongoing debate, about how do you make sure, as both the intelligence agencies and those who wish to do us harm, use these considerable new powers at their disposal in information technology, how do we make sure that all of that is held properly to account."Earlier this year, the Justice and Security Act 2013 gave the government's Intelligence and Security committee greater powers to scrutinise the work of the security services.Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be no review of the oversight of the security services, despite Guardian reports that Mr Clegg was to start conversations in government about one.The prime minister said on Thursday "a good legal framework" already existed.A spokesman said Mr Cameron "thinks the current system is a good one and it works well," but "if others have ideas he is prepared to listen to them".Mr Clegg responded to the question of more oversight of the security services on Friday saying the government had already "significantly strengthened the powers of oversight".But he added that "many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified".Former Home Secretary Jack Straw also hit out at the Guardian saying its stance was "indulgent irresponsibility" which did not help protect the public.His comments come in an interview to be broadcast on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales.He said the Guardian had a "sense of power of having these secrets and excitement... about these secrets has gone to their heads"."They are blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are - are or not - likely to damage the national interest," said Mr Straw.Sir David, who is also a former head of the UK's communications surveillance centre GCHQ, told The Times there needed to be a difference acknowledged between whistleblowing to spark a debate and "the stealing of 58,000 top-secret British security documents" which he called "seriously, seriously damaging"."The assumption the experts are working on is that all that information or almost all of it will now be in the hands of Moscow and Beijing," he added.Nigel Inkster, who was director of operations and intelligence at MI6, and is now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told BBC Radio 4 programme The World at One he agreed with Sir David.He said terrorists would have a better awareness of how vulnerable it was to communicate with each other "via any one or any group of communications options that are available to them".He added that in terms of state-on-state espionage, "some of the reach and sophistication of the systems and capabilities developed by NSA and GCHQ have now been compromised".</body>

The value rose £1.1bn after trading began.At midday, the shares had eased back to 435p, 31.8% up. Private investors received 227 shares each.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Business Secretary Vince Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <description>A wealthy London woman was murdered by two "compulsive gamblers" in order to steal her property and financial assets, a court hears.</description>

      <body>A wealthy woman was murdered by two "compulsive gamblers" in order to steal her property and financial assets, a court has heard.Carole Waugh, 50, disappeared from her home in Marylebone, central London, in May last year and her remains were found three months later.The Old Bailey heard that Rakesh Bhayani, 41, and Nicholas Kutner, 48, had killed Miss Waugh in order to feed their gambling habit.The pair deny murdering Miss Waugh.Patrick Gibbs QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the men "had a taste for grand and expensive things and were gripped by the same compulsion to gamble".Miss Waugh's body was found in the boot of a car in a garage in New Malden in August 2012.Tests showed she had been stabbed in the neck.Mr Gibbs told the court that "the Crown cannot say whose hand was on the weapon"."But whoever struck the fatal blow, we say that Mr Bhayani and Mr Kutner planned it, and were responsible for it, and having taken her life, they then systematically took all her worldly goods as well."The prosecution claim that the men had a history of tricking and defrauding people.The court heard that once Miss Waugh was dead, Mr Bhayani got a number of women to impersonate the former accounts clerk on the telephone.He then "rehearsed" the women so they could strip Miss Waugh of her assets in shops and banks by using her credit cards.After her death, Miss Waugh's identity was also used to buy gold bullion and Krugerrands, the jury was told.Mr Gibb said the women would not be on trial as the prosecution would focus on the murder of Miss Waugh and the concealment of her murder.He said Miss Waugh had not had a regular job, but had worked as an accounts clerk in Libya in the oil industry and was "a woman who had plenty of money"."That was to prove her undoing," he said."She owned her flat, worth more than £600,000, she had savings, shares, jewellery and a cash income from working as an amateur escort."He told the court that Miss Waugh had known Mr Bhayani for a while, had visited him in prison and lent him £40,000."It seems that she had been intimate with him at one time or another in the past [and] may have first met him through an advertisement of herself as an escort that she had placed on the internet."Like everyone else that has met Mr Bhayani, she was taken in by him."She thought that he was her friend, but you may decide by the end of this trial that Mr Bhayani doesn't really do friends."He said that Mr Bhayani had been released from prison, "knowing how much she had, he planned that she should die".He add that Miss Waugh had known Mr Kutner less well and had not been intimate with him.The trial continues.</body>

      <body>Two Britons arrested after a Greenpeace protest at an offshore oil drilling rig have been denied bail in Russia.A court in Murmansk ruled that Kieron Bryan, from London, and Philip Ball, of Oxfordshire, should remain in pre-trial detention until 24 November.The pair were among six Britons on board the organisation's boat Arctic Sunrise held on 18 September.Greenpeace has called from the release of Mr Bryan on the basis he was a journalist working alongside activists.All 30 people on the vessel have been accused of piracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.Four earlier bail applications from Russians - including another journalist - were also refused.Freelance video journalist Mr Bryan, 29, appeared in court behind a glass screen, wearing a green checked shirt.Russia's Interfax news agency quoted him as saying he did not have journalistic accreditation and intended to sell his footage after returning from the Arctic."I had just verbal contracts. Verbal agreements with many leading TV companies that I would provide them with footage afterwards," Bryan told the court.Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said the court's decision "flies in the face of all reason".He added: "The decision of the court to refuse bail looks increasingly like the Russian authorities are meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment even before any trial."In the case of Kieron Bryan, he is a professional journalist, travelling on the Greenpeace ship, witnessing a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean."He has committed no crime and should be released immediately."The BBC's Moscow Correspondent Daniel Sandford reports that lawyers for the two men argued that the Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya oil platform is more like an island than a ship, so piracy charges should not apply.Sergey Golubuk, a lawyer for Greenpeace International, said the detainees were denying the charge of piracy - defined by international law as "violent attack with personal gain in mind" at sea.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "All these basic indefensible elements of piracy are obviously lacking in all people on board Arctic Sunrise, without exception."Mr Bryan's brother said his family had not been able to speak to him since his arrest and were finding the situation difficult.The 32-year-old, originally from Shebbear in north Devon, has only been able to contact his family through a single letter, written nearly two weeks ago.Russell Bryan told Today: "Mum and Dad are finding it very hard, and myself as well. We haven't heard from Kieron in almost three weeks now, in terms of phone calls."It's been very hard not being able to speak to him."Kieron is a freelance journalist. He is not a Greenpeace member or a Greenpeace activist. This is not something that Kieron would have anticipated at all."A spokesman for Vladimir Putin denied the Russian President had put pressure on the investigation by declaring on 25 September that the protesters had violated international law.Russia's Investigative Committee has said the charges against some of those detained might change because drugs - thought to be poppy straw and morphine - were found on the boat.Poppy straw, or raw opium, can be used to produce morphine or heroin.The committee also said investigators were trying to establish which detainees were responsible for "deliberately ramming" Russian coastguard boats in the Arctic.Greenpeace said any suggestion illegal drugs were found was a "smear" and "fabrication" as its ships only carry medical supplies required under maritime law.The UK government, meanwhile, has raised the case of the six detained Britons with the Russian authorities.Those being held with activist Mr Ball and Mr Bryan are logistics co-ordinator Frank Hewetson from London, activist Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales, communications officer Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon and 2nd engineer Iain Rogers, from Exeter.</body>

      <body>The remains of two people have been found in a back garden in Nottinghamshire, police have confirmed.Officers said human remains were found in the garden of a property in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, on Thursday.Police said they were led to the address after information came to light about an "incident" alleged to have taken place in the late 1990s.A neighbour said an elderly couple had lived in the property in the 1990s but had disappeared.The 51-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, said the couple were living at the house when she moved in 18 years ago.She said: "They never had any visitors. I never saw anyone coming or going."My friend and I always used to say, 'I wonder what happened to that couple'. They just disappeared. We thought they had emigrated."Nottinghamshire Police said it could not comment on the claim.Insp Mark Webster said it could be "several weeks or months" before the bodies were formally identified.He said the current owners of the house were not part of the investigation at this time and confirmed no arrests had been made.A post-mortem examination to establish the causes of death was being carried out on Friday.Mr Webster appealed for anyone with information on the discovery to come forward but said residents should not be fearful."We don't believe that there is any risk of any harm coming to the community," he added."People are clearly going to be concerned when an incident of this nature happens and we would like to reassure them."The property remains cordoned off while forensic examinations are carried out.</body>

      <title>Barclays to join Help to Buy scheme</title>
      <description>Barclays has become the latest bank to announce it is signing up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <date>1381488610</date>
      <body>Barclays has become the latest bank to announce it is signing up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.This means about two-thirds of lenders in the UK's mortgage market have said they will sign up to the project.The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.The move leaves Nationwide Building Society as the UK's only major mortgage lender yet to decide whether to join.Barclays has not yet published details of any rates or timing of mortgage products that fall under the Help to Buy umbrella."We are pleased to confirm that Barclays will participate in the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme," a spokesman for the bank said.Under the latest phase of the scheme, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is up to 0.9% of the original loan level. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Borrowers who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.Products are already on the market from RBS/NatWest and the Halifax, with Santander, HSBC, Virgin Money, Lloyds, TSB and Aldermore all saying that they will start offering products by the start of January.The government has said that the scheme will correct a problem in the market that locks out a number of tenants paying high rents and unable to save enough for a deposit, even though they could afford mortgage repayments.But Labour said the focus should be on house building, to correct a lack of supply of affordable homes.The latest news of Barclays' participation comes as mortgage lenders reported that the number of first-time buyers was already growing quickly from a low base.The Council of Mortgage Lenders said that the number of loans approved for first-time buyers rose by 33% in August compared with the same month a year earlier.</body>

      <title>Firefighters confirm new strike date</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage a five-hour strike on 19 October amid a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage a second strike on 19 October amid a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said.The five-hour strike by union members will take place from 18:30 until 23:30.The government plans to make firefighters work up to 60 and argues that the pension offer is generous.But FBU general secretary Matt Wrack says the late-50s is too old to be fighting fires and rescuing families and is not ruling out further strikes.Firefighters in Scotland will not strike after they voted in a consultation that Scottish government proposals were sufficient to prevent a strike, the FBU says.Mr Wrack said: "We had hoped our first strike was enough to show government that firefighters could not be more serious about protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions."No firefighter wants to strike, and it's desperately disappointing that governments in Westminster and Cardiff continue to deny reality over pensions costs and the need for a pension scheme that reflects the job firefighters do."Firefighters simply cannot be expected to fight fires and rescue families in their late 50s and into their 60s."We hope this second strike will mean both governments will be willing to discuss the full range of concerns that firefighters and the general public have expressed."However, more strikes cannot be ruled out if that's what it takes to protect public and firefighter safety from these ludicrous attacks."During the first strike on 25 September, 32,000 union members walked out for four hours, according to the FBU.Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-unionised fire crews and bringing in private contractors.The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work.No major incidents were reported during the strike, which was the first national walkout for a decade.</body>

      <body>Three prisoners are holding a roof-top protest at HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton.A spokeswoman for G4S, which runs the prison near Wolverhampton, said: "We can confirm that an incident involving three prisoners is taking place at HMP Oakwood."The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has been alerted, she added.The Chief Inspector of Prisons has criticised the prison for failing to tackle drug issues.The report published on Tuesday found inmates said it was easier to obtain drugs than soap at the prison.The Prison Ombudsman, Nigel Newcomen QC, has also criticised the emergency response by prison staff when one of its inmates stopped breathing.Edward Ham, 54, was declared dead in his cell in February.Mr Newcomen said his treatment had been "unacceptably poor" and a summary of his report found staff could not access a defibrillator as it was locked away.HMP Oakwood opened in April 2012 and houses about 1,600 inmates.In July it was one of two private prisons to receive the Ministry of Justice's lowest rating.The MoJ declined to comment on Friday's protest.</body>

      <title>Total gay blood ban 'is irrational'</title>
      <description>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge rules</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24494371</url>
      <date>1381502282</date>
      <body>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge has ruled.He also held that Health Minister Edwin Poots breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive.The judge gave the verdict in a challenge brought by an unidentified homosexual man.The complete ban, put in place during the 1980s, was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.It was replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago.The 12-month deferral was left in place following a Government Advisory Committee report.It identified a much shorter period during which infection with blood-borne viruses could not be detected.Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety.But a gay man granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability launched a judicial review challenge to Mr Poots' position on blood donation.The judge heard claims that the minister displayed apparent bias that went beyond religious beliefs and into the realms of prejudice.It was revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.Attorney General John Larkin QC, the chief legal adviser to the Stormont Executive, questioned the legitimacy of the challenge.He claimed the challenge was a waste of time because the applicant had previously had sex for money.Mr Larkin rejected arguments that the issue required full executive approval and questioned whether the minister had made a decision to maintain the current ban.However, the judge said that in continuing the lifetime deferral policy the minister had deviated from the position taken in England, Scotland and Wales.He said the decision was made against the secretary of state's recommendation that the report from the advisory committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) should be followed.The judge held that the additional risk from deferring donation for 12 months, instead of permanently, was very minimal.He said: "The minister has decided that MSM (males who have sex with other males) behaviour creates such a high risk of infection to the donor that such donors must be permanently deferred with the result that such blood cannot enter the Northern Ireland blood stock."Importing blood from other places which do accept MSM donors, even in limited quantities, leaves the door open for MSM blood to do just that."There is clearly a defect in reason here."Applying different standards to imported blood defeats the whole purpose of a permanent deferral, he added.Declaring the decision irrational, he said: "If there is a genuine concern about the safety of MSM donated blood such that the blood stock must be protected absolutely from such blood then the security of that blood must actually be maintained absolutely."Dealing with the alleged breach of the ministerial code, the judge said the lifetime ban was both controversial and cross-cutting, taking in equality issues."As such the minister had no authority to act without bringing them to the attention of the Executive Committee which he failed to do."In doing so the minister breached the ministerial code and... had no legal authority to take a decision in breach of the ministerial code."</body>

      <title>Driving test age rise considered</title>
      <description>Teenagers could have to wait a year longer before being allowed to take their driving test under proposals being considered by the government.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24485792</url>
      <date>1381493119</date>
      <body>Teenagers could have to wait a year longer than currently before they are allowed to take their driving test.The government is considering issuing only 12-month probationary licences at the age of 18 in a bid to cut accidents involving young motorists.New drivers would also face a curfew between 22:00 and 05:00 unless a passenger aged over 30 was in the car.Ministers are due to publish a Green Paper this year after considering the Transport Research Laboratory's report.It recommends a one-year "learner stage" beginning at 17, during which drivers would have to total at least 100 hours of daytime and 20 hours of night-time practice under supervision.Learners can then take their test at 18 and, if they pass, will get a probationary licence and have to display a green "P" plate.During this stage, drivers will face the curfew and all those under 30 will be banned from carrying any passengers also under 30.Other proposals under consideration for young drivers are a ban on all mobile phone use, including hands-free phones, and a lower alcohol limit.After the 12-month probationary period, drivers will automatically graduate to a full licence and unrestricted driving.Statistics show that more than a fifth of deaths on British roads in 2011 involved drivers aged 17-24.The report suggests implementing this new system could cut annual casualty numbers by 4,471 and save £224m.A Department for Transport spokesman said: "Young drivers drive around 5% of all the miles driven in Britain but are involved in about 20% of the crashes where someone is killed or seriously injured."We are committed to improving safety for young drivers and reducing their insurance costs - that is why we are publishing a Green Paper later in the year setting out our proposals."This will include a discussion about how people learn to drive."The research report has been produced by the Transport Research Laboratory under commission by the Department for Transport and it, amongst other things, has informed the Green Paper."Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation motoring research charity, welcomed the proposals.He said: "Young people are four times more likely to die in a road accident than as a result of drink or drugs."Yet, as a society we seem to turn a blind eye to the carnage. If this was any other area of public health there would be an outcry."This is about ensuring their long-term safety and mobility. Not curtailing it."Edmund King, president of motoring organisation the AA, said the proposals were addressing the problem of young drivers in the "wrong way"."You should prepare young drivers to be safe when they get their licence rather than give them their licence and then restrict them," he told BBC's Breakfast.He said he would like to see mandatory lessons on motorways, in rural areas and in bad weather, and warned of the problems of policing the restrictions such as carrying young passengers.Julie Townsend, of road safety charity Brake, welcomed the report, saying it was further recognition of the compelling case for graduated driver licensing.She urged the government to act "swiftly and decisively" to commit to the system to help reduce the danger young drivers posed to themselves and others.Currently drivers in England, Scotland and Wales need to pass a theory test, then a practical test before they can apply for a full driving licence. The minimum age to hold a full car licence is 17, or 16 for some people claiming mobility benefit.Your commentsMy son is 12-years-old and has had five lessons with a young drivers school. Why doesn't the government promote these in school? They give kids the chance to learn at a early age to drive sensibly. These school are run throughout the country but even after taking lessons they don't get any credit from insurance companies. Let's look at this instead of increasing the age of driving. Rod Peart, Carlisle, CumbriaI think it is great to raise the age, set out curfews and limit the amount of hours that these kids need to practice before taking their test. My son is now 18-years-old, but he had a lot of practice on the road and passed second time round. He seems very aware of the dangers. But not all his peers are the same - at least three of them have had accidents during their first few weeks of driving - at least two of those accidents were because they were showing off to each other. Go on - raise the age and add some curfews. Gael Atkinson, SussexI am 17-years-of-age and have been learning for the past four months and I am almost ready to take my test. Whilst on my driving lessons my instructor and I see countless people over the age of 30 driving dangerously. Age is not the problem, maturity is. My family have been in few collisions where people over the age of fifty haven't looked or couldn't control their car. Where are the limitations for them?Reanne, Exeter, DevonMy 19-year-old son has recently passed his test and my 17-year-old will be wanting lessons at some point. We live in a rural area where there is little public transport. This suggestion would mean that my 17-year-old son would not be able to take up a night shift job to support himself or drive to school. Rather than fiddle about with difficult to enforce curfews, etc. for young drivers, would it not be better to have a more rigorous driving test, involving motorways, rural roads and night driving?John Hall, Steeple Bumpstead, EssexAs a driving instructor I welcome these proposals. We need to get people talking about how we can improve the skills of new drivers. The statistics for accidents involving young drivers are horrific. The probationary licence for new drivers sounds like a good idea in theory although we kind of have that at the moment, as if you accrue six points in your first year of driving you will have to resit your test. I myself would be in favour of a longer test with all the manoeuvres and motorway driving looked at. Steve Kirk, Bolton, Greater ManchesterIt should be raised to the age of 21. This would reduce accidents, free up roads, increase use of public transport, make young people walk or cycle thereby promoting health and energy, ensure that some maturity and responsibility in life was achieved prior to driving, and would reduce insurance costs for all. I have three sons, all aged over 23, only one drives having passed his test at the age of 22. Gary Stapleton Harrogate, North YorkshireBy the time teenagers learn to drive they are expected to take contract buses into college, or get public transport to work or apprenticeships. The price of these go up way higher than the rate of inflation and it's clearly forcing everyone onto the road. It's not just teenagers who are being involved in accidents! A lot of colleagues at school will have to take more money from their parents to be able to pay for transport. They will be even more dependent on their parents. I, myself, haven't learned to drive yet, I am 18 and am starting driving lessons soon. I just think that these sort of measures are driving the country into some Orwellian Police State.Miles, Fareham</body>

      <title>We have problem with women - Tory MP</title>
      <description>Male Conservatives must rethink their attitudes and behaviour towards women, says Tory MP Bernard Jenkin.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24491440</url>

      <body>Male Conservatives must rethink their attitudes and behaviour to women or be "left behind", a Tory MP has said.Writing in the House magazine, Bernard Jenkin said many Tory men feel "women's issues" should be left to women "so men can get on with running the country".The lack of women in the upper reaches of government and the party was proof of the culture change needed, he added."We have perhaps yet to understand what change in the Conservative Party really means," he claimed.Monday's coalition reshuffle was seen as an attempt to boost the proportion of female ministers in government and to promote more women to senior positions.Among those to get promotions were Esther McVey, Jane Ellison and Nicky Morgan.Anna Soubry broke new ground by becoming the first ever female defence minister - after complaining that she had been given her previous role as public health minister because David Cameron thought only a woman could do a "soft bloody girly" job.Mr Cameron has said he wants a third of ministers to be women by the end of the Parliament 2015.But of the 32 ministers entitled to attend Cabinet, currently only five are women.Opinion polls have suggested the government's popularity among female voters has fallen sharply since 2010 although a recent Ipsos-Mori survey suggested the three main party leaders could all do more to address women's concerns.Mr Cameron has come under fire from Labour critics in the past for allegedly sexist attitudes towards female MPs, particularly after he told shadow minister Angela Eagle to "calm down, dear," during prime minister's questions.But the prime minister has always rejected claims he and his party have a problem with attracting women voters.Labour has used all-women shortlists to boost its number of female MPs and leader Ed Miliband has said his aim is to have a shadow cabinet that is 50% woman.The Conservatives have always resisted all-women shortlists, arguing that they unfair and patronising - and that women should be promoted on merit rather than gender.The Lib Dems, who have the smallest percentage of female MPs among the three main parties, just seven out of 57 MPs, are understood to be considering all-women shortlists.But Mr Jenkin suggested the problem lay at the top of government, such as the all-male "quad" of David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, who make the key coalition decisions.And it was a question of ingrained attitudes within the Conservative Party."Many of us Tory men tend to feel that 'women' can deal with 'women's issues', so men can get on with running the country."The Quad are all men. The National Security Council is overwhelmingly men. The Tory high command (David Cameron, George Osborne and Lynton Crosby) are all men."Only three out of 25 on the Party Board are women. Most of the advisers and policy wonks are men."And of course, most MPs will continue to be men. It is going to take a long time to change all this, so what else must we change? We should look at how we all behave."An MP since 1992, Mr Jenkin was once in charge of efforts to make the Conservative parliamentary party more diverse, by getting more female and ethnic minority candidates elected. He now chairs the public administration select committee.All men were guilty of "unconscious slights to women", Mr Jenkin added, but women voters "see it and feel it" when senior politicians do it."A business change programme would involve zero tolerance of such behaviour. We have perhaps yet to understand what "change" in the Conservative Party really means.""It is not something the leadership does, or women can do for us. Every man in the Conservative Party needs to change or be left behind. The leadership needs to be on this 24-7-365, not just at reshuffle time."Labour said the Conservatives were simply "out of touch" with the challenges facing women in the current financial climate."It is a problem which goes right up to David Cameron and has seen women disproportionately affected by his government's cost of living crisis," said shadow equalities minister Gloria De Piero."While nearly half of Labour's shadow cabinet are women, David Cameron has only four women in his top team of 22. That says it all."However, former home secretary Jacqui Smith recently criticised the absence of a woman in Labour's 2015 general election planning team.</body>

      <title>Plaid's pledge to cut energy bills</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, addressing the party conference, announces plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.</description>

      <date>1381503345</date>
      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has announced plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.Energy Wales would buy gas and electricity at wholesale prices and sell direct to consumers and firms, she told the Aberystwyth conference.Surpluses would be spit between protecting customers and expanding energy efficiency measures.Ms Wood said the firm would work as an arms-length company like Welsh Water."When Labour's energy price freeze begins to thaw and prices begin to spike again, Plaid Cymru would have enabled the building of our cheaper, permanent, people-powered Welsh alternative," she said.In her second annual conference speech since being elected party leader, she said Plaid would recruit 1,000 extra doctors if it won the assembly election in 2016.This would be financed by a sugary drink levy of up to 20p per litre, she said.She also announced radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales over the next assembly term.Ms Wood also announced an "alternative way forward" on hospital reorganisation plans.Labour has accused her of blocking a controversial shake-up of some specialist services without suggesting alternatives.Welsh Labour ministers have insisted closing some hospitals and moving some core services from smaller to larger hospitals are essential to make the NHS safe and sustainable.Some of the most controversial have been in south Wales, with opposition to proposals to move key specialist care from Llantrisant's Royal Glamorgan hospital as part of changes at five health boards.Ms Wood said Plaid was committed to delivering a better Welsh NHS with 1,000 extra doctors."We will provide more doctors so these services can stay open and stay safe," she said.Money would be raised by levy of up to 20p a litre on sugary drinks."If a thousand extra doctors sounds over-ambitious consider this."With them, Wales would only be brought up to the UK average - so we must have those extra doctors."She told party members this would help provide a more efficient NHS, as would plans to better integrate hospitals and social care "to get patients out of hospital and back into their own home".The Plaid leader said funding to begin this integration had already been won as part of a package of measures the party had this week announced with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers in a deal on the Welsh budget.Ms Wood said there was a "crisis of obesity and diabetes that was killing us as a nation."She also unveiled radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales, over the next assembly term.Plaid has said previously Wales can learn from how Norway, Germany and Denmark have offered modern hospital care without centralisation.The party has argued planning the NHS workforce more effectively and better recruitment practices would help reduce some of the strains on the health service.Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru was the only party addressing people's big concerns at the 2016 assembly election and that "Wales is better than this".Ms Wood started her speech by saying Plaid would build on recent momentum.She said this would "carry us forward over the finishing line" to win the assembly election in 2016."It isn't a sprint but a marathon and I'm firing the starting pistol here today."She said she was committed to Plaid being the next government of Wales "so we can build Wales up, turn around the economic situation, stand on our own two feet."Plaid Cymru also points to the budget deal it signed with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers earlier in the week which put more money into treating patients in the community as a way of both improving services and keeping more patients out of hospital.All party members who attend the two-day conference will be able to vote on the motions debated. Until now that was reserved for delegates representing various sections of the party.The change is part of internal reforms brought in following Plaid Cymru's disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election.Ms Wood promoted plans to cut business rates for smaller firms on the opening day of the two-day Aberystwyth event.Firms would qualify for reduced business rates if their rateable values was below £15,000, rather than £12,000 under the current regime.A rateable value below £10,000 would mean paying no business rates, rather than the £6,000 ceiling at present.Ms Wood has also defended her party's election performances since devolution.With the SNP in government in Scotland, she was asked on BBC Radio Wales why the Scottish nationalists had moved so much further on than Plaid."I think it reflects the different settlement that Wales has had compared to Scotland," said Ms Wood."Scotland is so much further ahead in terms of the devolution settlement and Wales is in a different place."Our settlement is much weaker as is our economic situation and that's why I've said since I've become the leader of Plaid Cymru that the economy and job creation should be our number one priority."I would argue that Scotland has got a government that puts Scotland first and Scottish communities first at every opportunity and Wales needs a government now that will do that and I would argue that a Plaid Cymru government after 2016 is what the country needs now."SNP MP Pete Wishart urged Plaid activists to join in with the campaign.To enthusiastic applause, he told the conference: "We will win, because independence is the aspiration...that puts the future of Scotland in the hands of the people who live and work in Scotland."</body>

      <body>The "dark web" services used by criminals will continue to evolve in an attempt to evade authorities, the UK's cybercrime boss has warned.Last week, notorious drugs market place the Silk Road was shut down after a lengthy investigation.Andy Archibald, interim head of the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), said officers identified individuals who were using the site.But he said new methods were needed to keep up with the threat."[Online anonymity service] Tor evolves, and will resecure itself," Mr Archibald told the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones."The success we've had may not necessarily mean that by the same routes and same approaches we can get into other criminal forums."We have to continually probe and identify those forums and then seek to infiltrate them and use other tools."It's not simply a case of because we were able to infiltrate Tor on this occasion that we'll be able to do it next time around as well."Mr Archibald's comments came as the NCCU announced its first conviction. Twenty-seven-year-old Olukunle Babatunde received a five years and six month prison sentence.The man, from Croydon, south London, pleaded guilty to using "phishing" scams in an attempt to defraud banks, financial institutions and their customers.</body>

      <body>Output in the construction industry fell slightly in August, although house-building was up, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).UK construction output slipped 0.1% in August, the ONS said. House-building picked up 1.6%, but activity in new public projects and repairs fell.The figures mark a sharp slowdown from July, when construction output rose by 2.8%.However, the August figure still means output is up 4% on the year.That it is the strongest annual increase since December 2011.Construction activity accounts for about 6.3% of the economy.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the August figures point to construction providing a strong boost to the economy in the third quarter."The turnaround so far this year has been quite remarkable," he said. "Having been contracting at an annual rate of 12.4% last December, the industry is now growing at a rate of 4%."The increasingly broad-based upturn (in construction) suggests that companies are beginning to increase their capital investment, which bodes well for the sustainability of the economic recovery."The government has been trying to encourage more house-building and says its Help to Buy scheme will bolster supply as well as demand.A private sector survey last week suggested that growth in the construction sector was stronger in the third quarter. The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index hit a near six-year peak in August before easing slightly in September.</body>

      <title>Man died after eating caffeine mints</title>
      <description>A coroner is writing to the government with concerns over a high-energy mint, after a Black Country man died from a caffeine overdose caused by eating too many of them.</description>

      <body>A man died from a caffeine overdose after eating too many high-energy mints, an inquest heard.John Jackson was found dead at his home in Wednesbury, West Midlands, on 2 May after eating Hero Instant Energy Mints.The 40-year-old had twice the recommended adult daily caffeine intake in his blood.Coroner Robin Balmain, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, said he would contact the Department of Health to see if action should be taken.Mr Jackson's daughter, Rebecca Court, 23, said her father had treated the energy products "like they were any other mint"."There is a warning on them, but it's tiny and in the shops they're sold next to all the other mints," she said."It's scary. I think they should be sold behind the counter."Speaking after the inquest, Mr Balmain said: "I think the public need to know about these mints."Each one contains as much caffeine as the leading energy drink."There are people who constantly chew on sweets."If they eat these mints, they might ingest a huge amount of caffeine without knowing it."Mr Jackson, from Walsall Road, had a liver condition which was a contributory factor in his death.However, the cause of death was given as caffeine toxicity.Mr Balmain said he had never come across caffeine overdose as a cause of death before.He could not say how many of the sweets Mr Jackson had eaten before his death, or whether the deceased man was aware of their high caffeine content."He may not have have been aware of the dangers - I think there's a strong possibility of that," Mr Balmain said."These mints cost £4 for a packet of 12 but, nevertheless, they are mints and people may treat them as sweets."A spokesperson for Hero Energy said they were shocked at the news of Mr Jackson's death.He said the company was very vocal about the associated risks of caffeine consumption."We have many satisfied customers and their health and safety is very important to us," he said."We will continue to strive for greater levels of consumer education, so customers can make informed decisions about all caffeinated products."</body>

      <body>A blind golfer has a hit a hole-in-one during a tournament.Jim O'Brien, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, achieved the feat on the sixth hole at the Peter Alliss Eye2Eye Challenge at Surrey's Hindhead Golf Club on Wednesday.The 71-year-old, who is fully blind and has been playing for 16 years, said, to his knowledge, he was only the third blind golfer to land such a shot.Chris Donovan, the club's secretary, said it was an "amazing achievement".Mr O'Brien said: "It's every golfer's dream, to do a hole-in-one especially if you're totally blind."When I teed off, I hit the ball nicely. The only thought I had in my head was, 'Let's hope it makes the green'."After a few seconds, the guys I was with said 'It's in the hole'. It was a great feeling - it's unbelievable."The England and Wales Blind Golf Association has been holding the one-day tournament at the club for a number of years.The blind players are helped by a sighted caddie or guide, who lines them up for shots.Mr O'Brien, who has been unable to see since he was a child, was helped by his guide John Grindal.Mr Donovan said the odds of a fully-sighted golfer hitting a hole-in-one were between 12,000 and 14,000-to-one."It's an amazing achievement for any amateur golfer, even more so for a blind player," he said.Neil Baxter, chairman of the England and Wales Blind Golf Association, said that he knew of three totally blind members of the association who had hit holes-in-one, although others had also done it."There was a chap in Birmingham who got one earlier this year but we're not sure whether he was totally blind," he said."It's very, very rare and Jim is totally blind. We're all delighted about it."</body>

      <title>Robbie Williams 'gutted' by R1 snub</title>
      <description>The singer admits he is jealous of younger pop stars, like One Direction, who are guaranteed airplay on the BBC network.</description>

      <body>Pop star Robbie Williams says he is "gutted" that BBC Radio 1 no longer plays his records."I'm very ambitious," he told BBC Radio 4's Mastertapes programme. "So when Radio 1 goes and is taken away from you, a huge bit of your arsenal goes.""It's your main oxygen to get your stuff out there."Radio 1 failed to put Williams' number one single Candy on their playlist last year, but his recent collaboration with Dizzee Rascal did make it on the air.The star's new swing album, Swings Both Ways, is unlikely to be a fixture on the station.Radio 1's breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw previously said Williams, 39, was "not relevant" to his target audience of 15-29 year olds."I liked Take That when I was little, but I'm not little anymore," he told Five news."I don't know if he's now for a Radio 1 audience."The station's head of music has also said rock groups Green Day and Muse may have outgrown the station."The last Green Day project simply wasn't good enough," George Ergatoudis told trade magazine Music Week.Muse, meanwhile "are approaching a crossroads" - their last single was the first one not playlisted by Radio 1 in a decade."The door remains open to them but we'll have to think carefully about their next album."'Over-sensitive'Speaking to John Wilson, Williams admitted he was jealous of the younger pop stars who are guaranteed airplay, including One Direction's Harry Styles."He's talented, he's good looking. He could have it away," said Williams."And I'll be sat here saying 'damn him'.But, he continued, "everybody who's anybody has been competitive and over-sensitive and a bit silly"."Look at Paul McCartney, look at Elton John. They're jealous of Justin Timberlake. I'm sure they were jealous of me when I was in my imperial phase."The Mastertapes series looks at a classic album in depth - in this instance Life Thru A Lens, Williams' debut record.Released in 1997, the album featured the hit singles Angels and Let Me Entertain You.In the wide-ranging interview, he discussed how the album was recorded in the depths of the alcohol-fuelled depression that followed his exit from Take That.Co-writer Guy Chambers recalled how Williams was often "too drunk to make it" to recording sessions."We were often trying to get him to do the vocal for Angels," he said. "That went on for weeks."Williams also revealed that he could no longer take to the stage without a lyric sheet, after forgetting the words to Angels on a live edition of The X Factor in 2009."It caused a chink in the armour," he admitted.The third series of Mastertapes will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in November.Other guests include David Crosby, discussing his solo debut If I Could Only Remember My Name, and Soul II Soul, on 1989's influential Club Classics Vol 1.Edwyn Collins and Natalie Merchant also take part.Recorded at the BBC's Maida Vale studios, each artist also plays live tracks from the album under discussion.Mastertapes: Robbie Williams A-Side will be broadcast on Monday, 11 November at 23:00, the B-Side programme will follow on 12 November at 15:30.</body>

      <body>A coroner has said she will send the file on the death of a toddler to the Public Prosecution Service.She was speaking after recording a verdict of non-accidental death in the case of Liam Gonzales Bennett from Ballymena, County AntrimThe 20-month-old boy died in February 2009. He had suffered 31 bruises to his head that medical experts said were possibly as a result of being punched.The coroner said it was disturbing that nobody had been made amenable.Samantha Bennett, the toddler's mother told the inquest she could not give any explanation as to how he sustained his injuries.She described how she had returned home from a shopping trip to find ambulance crews working on the unconscious child.Her then fiancé, Noel McKeown, had been looking after Liam and the child's older sister at the couple's home in Sunningdale Park.Ms Bennett wept as she described Liam lying on his bed wearing sunglasses earlier on the evening of his death. She had bought them for him as they were planning a trip to Tenerife to see his father.She said at this time he had been "in good form", but that he had cried a little when she took his dummy away at bedtime. She had left to go shopping after ensuring Liam was asleep. Noel McKeown, she said, was on the computer.A short time later, he rang her and told her Liam was not breathing and to "get home quick".Her voice breaking, Ms Bennett said: "Liam was lying in the hall on the floorboards and paramedics were working on him. I was in shock and kept shouting 'what's happened to Liam, what's happened to Liam?'"Mr McKeown had apparently tried to perform mouth to mouth resuscitation, guided by ambulance staff over the phone until they arrived.The coroner asked Ms Bennett if she could give the court any explanation of how Liam had sustained his injuries.Weeping, she replied with a single, almost inaudible, "no".Asked by her own barrister if she had caused those injuries, again she replied "no".Mr McKeown also gave evidence to the inquest via Skype from Australia where he is currently working.The coroner summarised Ms Bennett's evidence and asked Mr McKeown if he accepted this version of events. He said that he did.Technical problems with the connection meant he could not be seen by those in the court. There was total silence as his voice came through the small speaker of a tablet computer.He said Samantha Bennett had told him Liam was in bed and that he was not to disturb him. He said this was an unusually early time for Liam to be put to bed.Mr McKeown also said it was unusual for Ms Bennett to go out shopping at that time on a Saturday night."A short time after Samantha left, I heard a crying noise coming from Liam's bedroom. I went in. His back was totally arched and he was struggling to breathe," he said.He said that when Ms Bennett arrived home, she had been quiet.As with Ms Bennett, Mr McKeown was asked if he had any explanation as to how the injuries had been caused? He replied "no".The coroner asked "Did you cause those injuries?" He replied: "No, I did not."No-one has ever been charged in relation to the death, despite the police having carried out an investigation at the time.A retired detective told the inquest on Thursday that there was not enough evidence to establish who had caused the injuries to Liam.</body>

      <title>Be part of NI success story: Cameron</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron says Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.</description>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has said Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.Mr Cameron was addressing a major investment conference in Belfast.He urged foreign investors to "put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story"."Some people say it's a bit undignified for a prime minster to make a sales pitch, I say nonsense," he said."I'm passionate about the power of business to create jobs and growth and I'm passionate about what Northern Ireland has to offer, and so I'm here today with a very simple message."Put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story because investing in Northern Ireland makes good business sense."Mr Cameron told the conference at Belfast's Titanic Building that Northern Ireland had put on a "great G8" during the summer."What was seen this summer was a new Northern Ireland open for business, ready for investment, strengthening the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity and determined to be defined not by divided past but by shared future," he said."With over 800 foreign investors, Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment, with almost 8,000 jobs from foreign investment in the last three years alone."Mr Cameron also visited the east Belfast factory of the aerospace company Bombardier, which said it will create at least 250 new jobs in the city over the next 12 months.On Thursday, it emerged the company hopes a future research programme will employ an additional 230 people.Speaking at Stormont Castle at the end of the conference, Mr Cameron condemned the murders of two men in Belfast and Londonderry."These murders are despicable and the people responsible should be hunted down prosecuted and convicted, they should face justice," he said.Mr Cameron said that investors believed Northern Ireland was a "safe and secure" place to do business.He said that First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness had taken risks for peace and that they would continue to take risks to ensure there was progress."They come from very different political parties, different traditions but they work together for the people of Northern Ireland," Mr Cameron added.Earlier, the first and deputy first ministers said Northern Ireland has much to offer international investors.Mr Robinson said Northern Ireland has "many of the building blocks in place" to take its economy to a "higher level".Mr McGuinness said the country had a young, educated workforce and offered a high standard of living.Mr Robinson said the key to moving Northern Ireland forward as one community was creating jobs and promoting social inclusion.He said at the heart of the Northern Ireland Executive's programme for government was the creation of a vibrant economy."The reaction we often get from potential investors who take the time to come here is that 'we didn't think that Northern Ireland had so much to offer,'" he said.Mr Robinson also joked that he hoped those attending the conference had enjoyed a traditional healthy, fat-free Northern Ireland breakfast.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness told delegates that Northern Ireland was a "very safe place to invest and to live, with very low crime levels".He said existing inward investors had been impressed with what Northern Ireland had to offer, including its "young educated workforce", excellent telecommunications infrastructure, government support and its location as a "gateway to Europe".Mr McGuinness said people in Northern Ireland had a "strong work ethic" and more than 60% of school leavers continued their studies by taking either further or higher education courses.The deputy first minister also praised the quality of life in Northern Ireland. He told investors that they would never be more than an hour's drive from either the sea or the mountains, and could enjoy first class golfing and fishing facilities.Speaking at the conference on Friday morning, Northern Ireland Economy Minister Arlene Foster said Mr Cameron had fulfilled a commitment he had made during the summer, when the prime minister hosted the G8 summit in County Fermanagh.She said he had promised in June to return to Northern Ireland to promote the role he believes it can play in the wider UK economy, and she added that the business event was part of the "economic legacy of the G8".Ms Foster said she was "very confident that there will be investment after this conference".The economy minister was asked if the murders of Kevin Kearney and Barry McCrory, who were shot dead within 48 hours in Belfast and Londonderry, had overshadowed the event.Ms Foster said: "Obviously those of us who live here are shocked and horrified that those sorts of murders can take place on our streets."However, she added: "We've been focusing on talking to the delegates about the good things in Northern Ireland - that fact that we have such good skills here, and if people invest in Northern Ireland they will definitely get value for money."The conference is the first event of its kind in Northern Ireland, since the global downturn began in 2008.</body>

      <title>Fears autistic pupils 'missing out'</title>
      <description>There are fears some children with suspected autism in Wales are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.</description>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed.Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis.In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis.According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education.But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed.Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties.But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis.His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area."I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn.She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities."When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said."They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space."Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism."I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said."In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well."Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom."It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said."The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas."A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need."We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities."We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD."A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times."The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said."The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner."More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday.</body>

      <body>A man from Port Glasgow has been formally arrested in Pakistan along with three other men in connection with the murder of his wife.Abdul Sattar's wife Mumtaz was killed in Pakistan on 21 September.Mr Sattar, 40, claimed the couple were drugged, attacked and thrown out of a taxi shortly after arriving in Lahore.They had been on their way to see his parents in Punjab. Mrs Sattar later died and was buried in Shahkot.Her husband has been detained in custody by police.The announcement was made at a media conference in Glasgow held by relatives of Mrs Sattar and the family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar.Mr Anwar said: "I can advise that Abdul Sattar has now been formally arrested and is presently in custody."I was advised by the investigating officer yesterday evening that all of Mumtaz Sattar's property, including her jewellery, as well as Mr Sattar's credit cards, passport and £3,500, were recovered yesterday. Included in the items was Mumtaz's diary."Mr Anwar said police in Pakistan had found a white car which Mr Sattar had said was a taxi used to transport him and his wife from outside the security perimeter of the airport in Lahore.The police had confirmed the vehicle was not a taxi, Mr Anwar said. He added that Mr Sattar had been seen on CCTV greeting males from the white car.He added: "Three other suspects in the murder have also been formally arrested. These men, who were on the run following the recovery of the white car on Sunday, are allegedly linked to the white car and to Abdul Sattar."Mr Anwar said he expected all four accused men to appear in court on Saturday, with bail likely to be opposed by the police.Scottish police have been helping the Pakistani authorities with their investigation.Last weekend the governor of the Punjab region, former Glasgow MP Mohammad Sarwar, assured Mrs Sattar's relatives that "justice will be done".</body>

      <body>A man who murdered a pensioner in his own home in West Lothian has been jailed for life.Keiryn Nisbet had denied killing Robert Simpson, 67, known as Ronnie, in Mayfield Drive, Armadale, on 6 October 2012.Nisbet, 22, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years before being eligible for parole.Sentencing Nisbet, judge Norman Ritchie QC said: "You are a danger to the public."He added: "This was a horrific and sustained attack on an old man in his own home."Nisbet entered the flat of Mr Simpson, who was a complete stranger, and repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on his head and body.He also struck Mr Simpson on the head with a blunt instrument and dragged him across the floor of his house.Mr Simpson received a number of blows to his head, but died as a result of injuries to his body which included fractured ribs.At the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Ritchie added: "For no known reason you assaulted Mr Simpson. This brutal and senseless attack left Mr Simpson lying dying in the living room of his flat."Mr Simpson had left his front door unlocked and it is thought Nisbet, who had been drinking for 10 hours and taken heroin and cocaine, may have gone inside thinking it was a former girlfriend's home.Once inside he subjected Mr Simpson, who was sitting watching television, to the violent attack.The police were called, but when they arrived they found Mr Simpson's home in darkness and left after seeing no signs of a disturbance.During that time Nisbet was in the flat with Mr Simpson.Judge Ritchie told Nisbet: "You did not get help for him. He either died in front of you or you left him to die alone."Nisbet showed no remorse and later tried to get into a nightclub before heading to a house party.When questioned by police he denied ever being in Mr Simpson's home, but was caught by forensic evidence as palm and fingerprints were found in the flat, along with footwear impressions, blood and DNA.Distinctive fibres from a red hooded top he was wearing that evening were also found while CCTV evidence and witnesses also placed him near the scene.Nisbet, who was on bail at the time, sent a message to a friend on Facebook saying he had attacked a man but could not fully remember what he had done.He continues to insist he is innocent.Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for High Court cases in the east of Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet subjected Robert Simpson, a quiet and frail man who walked with the aid of a walking stick, to a sustained, vicious and unprovoked attack in his own home."Det Ch Insp Robert Cowper, of Police Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet did not know Ronnie Simpson and throughout or enquiries we have been unable to establish any possible motive for this violent attack, which resulted in the 67-year-old's death."He has proven himself to be a cold and callous individual, who has shown no remorse for his actions and the impact they have had on Mr Simpson's family."With Keiryn Nisbet now set to spend a considerable period of time behind bars, I sincerely hope that Mr Simpson's family can put this horrendous ordeal behind them and begin to move on with their lives."</body>

      <description>A knife amnesty is to be held in Birmingham following five fatal stabbings since March.</description>

      <date>1381483710</date>
      <body>A knife amnesty is to be held in Birmingham following five fatal stabbings since March.The Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, Bob Jones, announced the plans after a meeting about the issue between the force and Birmingham City Council.Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said knife crime was falling.Derrick Campbell, a former government advisor on knife crime, said an amnesty would not make a difference.Speaking on Thursday, PCC Mr Jones said: "We haven't agreed the final details, we have agreed in principle that it's going to happen."We need to work through how it's going to work, how it's going to be publicised, and that's part of the task that we do have ahead."But Mr Campbell, who founded and chaired the group Birmingham Reducing Gang Violence, said he had been involved in three knife amnesties in the past."Unless they are targeted and time limited they aren't effective," he said."They do very little to deter people who are determined to carry a knife and there won't be a real drop in crime."All it does is provide an opportunity for people to get rid of old rusty blades. For something meaningful to happen it's about changing people's attitudes to carrying knives."Imposing tougher custodial sentences would have a more positive impact on reducing knife crime, he added.The PCC said he wanted the idea of a knife amnesty discussed by the 200 young people who will be at a youth summit he is hosting on 3 December."We want this to be something that works and resonates with young people to make sure that whatever the strategy is, it's meaningful," Mr Jones said.Mr Jones praised the ideas on tackling knife crime that came from an "excellent debate" organised by BBC WM.West Midlands Police launched the Knives cost Lives campaign in January.There have been five fatal stabbings in the city since March, including 15-year-old Hassan Mahmood in July and 16-year-old Christina Edkins, who was stabbed on a bus in March.Her killer, Phillip Simelane, from Walsall, has been detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.According to figures released by police, knife crime in Birmingham dropped by 25% between April 2011 and 2012.In 2012-13, there were 1,615 knife-related incidents in the city, although police said over the past six years knife crime had fallen by 63% across the force area.Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Overall knife crime is falling and a higher proportion of people are going to prison for knife possession than in previous years."It's encouraging that cautions have fallen and those who have previously been caught carrying a knife are twice as likely to go to prison."</body>

      <body>Police are investigating a "disgusting" cartoon video ridiculing an Essex mayor which was posted online.It features Basildon mayor Mo Larkin and includes a scene of her apparently giving birth to council leader Tony Ball.The video parodies a photograph taken of her on Armed Forces Day when she appeared to be looking at her phone while receiving a salute.Mr Ball said he and Mrs Larkin were "shocked" at the "disgusting" video."As politicians we expect to take the knocks and the bumps and you expect criticism when you put your head above the parapet," he added."But this goes well beyond that."A link to the online cartoon was sent to all members and officers at the council, Mr Ball said.The council then complained to police and workers were advised not to click on it.A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: "We are investigating allegations of malicious communications and inquiries are ongoing."No-one has yet been arrested, police say.After the photograph of Mrs Larkin on Armed Forces Day was circulated, the council opened an investigation into whether someone inside the council had taken the image to cause embarrassment to Mrs Larkin.Mr Ball said that investigation had not been successful in finding the person who had taken the image.Mrs Larkin is yet to comment on the matter.</body>

      <body>World champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will be asked to explain claims he rejected a £20,000 offer to fix a Premier League snooker match about 10 years ago."Someone rang me and said he'd like to meet me over in the forest and have a walk through the woods," O'Sullivan, 37, wrote in his new autobiography."What they were offering, 20 grand," he added, "I could get for a couple of nights' work."Snooker's governing body said he would be asked to clarify his claims."We are aware of what has been said in his book and we will be writing to Ronnie O'Sullivan to ask him to explain his comments," said Nigel Mawer, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's disciplinary committee.O'Sullivan, who won his fifth world title in May after taking a six-month break from the sport, said the meeting - in Epping Forest, Essex - lasted about 15 minutes."If anyone could get away with it, I could. I could just play one-handed or left-handed, or just put a towel over my head, and pretend I was going nuts," he said."But it's not something I would or could do. I couldn't live with myself; I'd feel that was robbing somebody."The revelation comes less than a month after former world top-five player Stephen Lee was handed a 12-year ban after being found guilty of seven match-fixing charges. He is appealing against the verdict.In an interview with BBC Sport, O'Sullivan was asked whether he had ever considered throwing a match."I can't do it. I enjoy playing - snooker's given me a great life," he said."You put all of that on the line. Without snooker you'd lose friends and family."You're not just taking the money, but jeopardising relationships with people, the sport, and the opportunity to embrace great things that being a professional snooker player can give you."O'Sullivan recently backtracked on a claim he made that Lee was not the only player guilty of match-fixing.The Essex player, nicknamed 'The Rocket', had originally tweeted: "I've heard there's many more players who throw snooker matches."I suppose Steve Lee was just caught out."No need to worry if you got nothing to hide. But plenty of people have got loads to hide. That's why there is no free speech. They're hiding."World Snooker boss Barry Hearn reacted by stating O'Sullivan's comments were "unacceptable and damaging".O'Sullivan later said he had "no concrete evidence of match-fixing in snooker", but hinted players were aware of who might be involved.</body>

      <body>Frank Maloney has retired from boxing after 30 years in the sport as a manager and promoter.Under Maloney's guidance, Lennox Lewis  became the first Briton to win a world heavyweight title for almost a century in 1992.Maloney, 60, hoped to achieve the same with David Price but the Liverpool heavyweight was beaten twice by American Tony Thompson in 2013."I have fallen out of love with boxing," said Maloney."My passion has been missing, my heart is no longer in the sport that I loved so much."Londoner Maloney became a household name in the 1990s, acting as manager and cheerleader to Lewis, the heavyweight division's last undisputed champion.Maloney also promoted David Haye when he became world cruiserweight champion and dozens of British, Commonwealth and European champions.Maloney was taken ill after Price's shock first defeat by Thompson in February and has suffered heart problems in the past."If I continued as his promoter it would be unfair as I cannot give the commitment and love for the sport that is needed to get David's career back on track," said Maloney."When I saw him in the gym last week it was my first visit to one for months and I no longer got the buzz I used to get."The sport has changed so much over the last few years. So many boxers listen to the last person they meet - and trainers who give time but invest no money into the sport are afforded too much power."It has also been a tough time for me personally and I feel a lot more at ease with myself by reaching this decision."David understands my decision, as do the other fighters I look after, including British cruiserweight champion Jon Lewis Dickinson."</body>

      <title>Sunday v Dimanche</title>
      <description>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle.</description>

      <body>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle. But how has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society and do the French really have anything to fear?In November 1993, protesters from across much of the UK (although not Scotland) were confident they could keep big shops closed on Sundays.Outside Parliament they raised placards reading "Don't give in to supermarket greed" and "No government can change the laws of God".Things always appeared very different across the Channel. The French had always seemed to grasp the notion of work-life balance - in British imagination at least, reserving their weekends for red wine and serene lunches.Not everybody in the UK shared that desire for a day of rest, however. "About 50 years ago Sundays were completely dead," says Joe Moran, a cultural historian.Once, pubs had to close between 3-7pm on a Sunday, and theatres and cinemas were closed altogether. Those rules were steadily relaxed in the years that intervened, but by the early 90s most shops were still banned from trading on Sundays.Michael Schluter, founder of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wanted to keep it that way, and lobbied MPs to support his movement. In December 1993, a vote in the House of Commons saw Schluter's vision defeated by just 18 votes. The following year all restrictions were removed from small shops, and those "over 280 square metres" in size were allowed to trade for six hours each Sunday.Today you only need to stand in a DIY superstore in a desolate retail park on a Sunday morning to see how things have changed. Customers gather in the store in the half-hour "browsing time" before the tills open, glancing over expectantly, ready to pounce. Their day is built around a visit to a big shop."It's fairly obvious that Sunday is a huge trading day in this country in spite of the fact that it's limited to six hours," says Richard Perks of market research firm Mintel.The British Retail Consortium says it is second only to Saturday for footfall and total sales - and is the biggest day in terms of hourly sales, as customers try to squeeze their shopping into the six hour window.While the UK has opened its shops on Sunday since 1994, the French have managed to keep most of theirs closed.It's easy to conjure up a vision of a stereotypical French Sunday and imagine families hiking through the Fontainebleau forest, cycling to the Bois de Boulogne park, or rounding off their poulet roti with a freshly baked tarte aux fraises.But now 20 years after the British battle was settled, a similar quarrel is bubbling in France, where different groups of workers take to the streets of Paris to argue both sides of the case. Its tangled web of regulations has been dubbed a "millefeuille" by the press - after the intricate, multi-layered, French pastry of the same name.Shops in designated tourist zones can open, as can garden centres and small owner-operated shops. Those selling food are permitted half a day's trading. For the most part, though, major retailers are forced to close all day, which has angered many business leaders, and some of their workers too.Castorama and Leroy Merlin - two major French DIY chains - have chosen to defy the ban, opening their doors to shoppers on the day of rest, and their employees have backed them. They have held "Yes Weekend" demonstrations to argue for their right to work.In the UK, there seems to be a particular link between Sunday leisure and home improvement.On a typical British Sunday, streams of family cars wait patiently for a space beneath IKEA's blue and yellow facade, trundling out hours later with open boots tied down by rope.It isn't just shopping that has turned Sundays upside down. The proliferation of televised sport has also contributed to a steady erosion of the distinction between the first and second days of the weekend. Schluter is convinced that the UK has lost something along the way, however.Besides small shops that have suffered from increased competition, family ties have been damaged too, he says. "There's a psychological shift which is hard to pin down or measure… towards an attitude that is less about the value of people and relationships and more about material goods."But the example of the British reforms is an inspiration to some French campaigners. Jerome Dubus of MEDEF, a consortium of French business leaders, says that reforms are overdue. "We are one of the last countries that haven't allowed Sunday work, we are behind as usual. I was a student in England 30 years ago. On Sundays everything was closed, there was nothing going on, we didn't know what to do, and the English were attached to it. But now it has changed a lot."Of course, the unions disagree. Christophe Le Comte, of Force Ouvriere, says that the move is just another example of employers trying to exploit their staff. "They are increasing the length of the working day, they are pushing back the age of retirement," he says. Le Comte bemoans the lack of employment protection in the UK and says Sunday trading had "disastrous consequences" for small businesses in the UK.Some change looks likely. The French government has now commissioned a review into the regulations, but whether it will endorse wholesale reform or add more layers to the pastry is difficult to know.Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French columnist for the British Daily Telegraph, thinks the unions are projecting a romantic notion of life in the country that is essentially a fiction."They describe a kind of idealised France of the 1950s in which everybody has got 2.3 children, and a dog, and a little house, and the children organise Sunday lunch for all members of the family."But half the households in large cities are single person households… so what they're describing is something that doesn't exist anymore."Trish Deseine, a food writer in Paris, has a very different outlook, and the city she describes will still sound appealing to the UK's Keep Sunday Special campaigners, who are still campaigning."If you walk by Montparnasse, you will see big family reunions in the restaurants," she says. "There is a definite distinction between Sunday and the rest of the week. There is a sense of occasion. It is quieter and more family oriented. I really hope it stays this way."She does not think the restrictions can last forever, but seems determined that change should at least be delayed."Eventually France will have to come around. The French are dragging their heels into a modern way of life, but I think it is a good thing that we are standing against it."Should France follow the UK and allow shops to open on Sundays? How has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society? Do the French really have anything to fear?Comment using the form below, on Facebook or on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Refugees 'told to show they are gay'</title>
      <description>Gay and lesbian people seeking asylum in the UK from persecution abroad are being ordered to "prove" their sexuality to immigration officers, MPs say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24479812</url>
      <date>1381446481</date>
      <body>Gay and lesbian people seeking asylum in the UK from persecution abroad are being ordered to "prove" their sexuality, MPs have said.In extreme cases claimants had handed over photographic and video evidence of "highly personal sexual activity" in an effort to persuade officials, the Home Affairs Committee found.The gay rights group Stonewall called the testing system "distressing".The Home Office promised to monitor and maintain standards.In its report on the asylum system, the committee said it was concerned by the quality of the UK Border Agency's decision-making, as 30% of appeals against initial decisions had been allowed in 2012.And a backlog of 32,600 asylum cases that should have been resolved in 2011 was yet to be concluded, while the number of applicants still waiting for an initial decision after six months had risen by 63% last year.Some had been waiting up to 16 years, while the housing with which they were provided was sometimes "appalling".It also said poor decision-making by officials was raising the risk of the UK harbouring war criminals.The committee also focused on the situation facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people seeking asylum.In its report, the committee said they faced "extraordinary obstacles" in persuading immigration officers of their case.Its chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, told BBC News: "It is absurd for a judge or a caseworker to have to ask an individual to prove that they are lesbian or gay, to ask them what kind of films they watch, what kind of material they read."People should accept the statement of sexuality by those who seek asylum. This practice is regrettable and ought to be stopped immediately."A Supreme Court ruling in 2010 stated that the "underlying rationale" of the United Nations Refugee Convention was that people should be able to "live freely and openly" in their own country without fear of persecution.This judgement, the committee said, had effectively overturned the Border Agency's previous emphasis on "voluntary discretion" - which had meant it should be seen an option for claimants to conceal their sexuality in order to avoid abuse.The report said: "The battleground is now firmly centred in 'proving' that they are gay. In turn, this has led to claimants going to extreme lengths to try and meet the new demands of credibility assessment in this area, including the submission of photographic and video evidence of highly personal sexual activity to caseworkers, presenting officers and the judiciary."The committee said: "We were concerned to hear that the decision making process for LGBTI applicants relies so heavily on anecdotal evidence and 'proving that they are gay'."It added that "it is not appropriate to force people to prove their sexuality if there is a perception that they are gay. The assessment of credibility is an area of weakness within the British asylum system."Furthermore, the fact that credibility issues disproportionately affect the most vulnerable applicants - victims of domestic and sexual violence, victims of torture and persecution because of their sexuality - makes improvement all the more necessary."The Refugee Council said the committee's report reflected its "grave concerns" about the UK asylum system.Chief Executive Maurice Wren said: "Failing to treat asylum seekers with dignity and, simultaneously, failing to deal effectively and fairly with their claims has created an expensive and counter-productive bureaucratic nightmare that all too often denies vulnerable people the protection from persecution and oppression they desperately need."Stonewall says LGBTI people in some countries have suffered rape, torture and death threats.Spokesman Richard Lane said: "Being gay isn't about what nightclubs you go to; it is a fundamental part of who you are."Sadly, in far too many cases, valuable time is spent attempting to 'prove' a claimant is gay in this way rather than establishing whether they have a legitimate fear of persecution."This is not only a waste of time and resources but can be deeply distressing to asylum seekers, many of who have fled for fear of their lives."A Home Office spokesman said: "The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it. We are committed to concluding all cases as quickly as possible, but asylum cases are often complex and require full and thorough consideration."We have robust mechanisms in place to monitor standards of housing provided to asylum seekers."He added: "We will continue to monitor performance to ensure that standards are met."</body>

      <body>A former senior intelligence official has questioned the impartiality of the committee scrutinising Britain's security services.Sir Francis Richards said it was "not a very good idea" for an ex-Conservative minister to head Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.But Sir Malcolm Rifkind said he was well placed to do the job as he had "handled intelligence" as a minister.It follows questions about intelligence leaked by US whistleblower Ed Snowden.Sir David Omand, a former UK homeland security adviser, has suggested the public disclosure of thousands of top-secret files by former CIA spy Edward Snowden was the most "catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".The episode has raised questions about the oversight of the British security services, with Business Secretary Vince Cable among those urging a review of current arrangements.The Guardian - which published the original revelations about the data-gathering and surveillance activities of the US National Security Agency and its relationship with UK agencies - has suggested that a debate was starting in government about updating the way politicians oversee the security services.The intelligence and security committee has access to classified intelligence material and holds its meetings in private for security reasons.Reporting to Parliament, it publishes an annual review of the UK's intelligence policy as well as the administration and funding of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.Its remit was expanded earlier this year to cover operational matters, as well as the intelligence-related work of other government agencies such as the Joint Intelligence Committee, the National Security Secretariat, the Defence Intelligence department in the Ministry of Defence and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Sir Malcolm, a former foreign and defence secretary under John Major, was appointed to chair the committee by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010.Sir Francis Richards, a career diplomat and former director of the GCHQ listening post, said he did not doubt Sir Malcolm's qualifications or ability to do the job but questioned whether he is "well-placed to command confidence".Sir Malcolm told BBC Radio 4's World At One, that the committee was "completely bipartisan" and the views he expressed as chairman were those of the whole committee, which has members from all parties."I'm perfectly happy to criticise and attack the government if they do something silly or stupid," he added."Quite a number of people on the Intelligence and Security Committee are former ministers because we are people who've actually handled intelligence. We've had to deal with it as users of the product."We are responsible for deciding whether the security services do something dumb or stupid or illegal and if they do, we are prepared to be very very brutal with them."Sir Malcolm also said those calling for more scrutiny "seemed to have forgotten" that the government had "dramatically increased" the powers of the committee.No 10 has insisted there is no government review of oversight of the security services and the prime minister thinks the current system is working effectively.But he said it was open to members of the National Security Council and the Privy Council to ask the security agencies questions, and he said David Cameron was prepared to listen to ideas from others.Mr Clegg told the BBC that the ISC's powers had already been "significantly strengthened" but there was an "ongoing debate" about whether more needed to be done."And I think many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified," he said.</body>

      <title>Rise in council tax court summonses</title>
      <description>Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken to court in England for non-payment of council tax as a result of the government's benefit changes, the Labour Party says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24482948</url>
      <date>1381479682</date>
      <body>Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken to court in England for non-payment of council tax owing to benefit changes, according to the Labour Party.Labour said 112 English councils had reported issuing 156,000 court summonses since April to people paying more tax as a result of the changes.That meant 450,000 individuals may have been taken to court across the whole of England in six months, it claimed.But Local Government minister Brandon Lewis said the survey was "misleading".He told the BBC there had been about three million summonses in the last year of the Labour government and the situation was now "getting much better".Labour asked all 326 billing authorities in England how many court summonses they had issued following the change to council tax benefit in April.It said the 112 authorities that responded were from a representative cross-section of councils, in terms of population density and deprivation, and extrapolating the numbers for the whole of England meant that as many as 450,000 individuals may have been taken to court since April.Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said Prime Minister David Cameron needed "to wake up to what's happening across the country"."People on the lowest income are struggling to pay his council tax rises."This is exactly what happened with the Poll Tax, as many are disabled people, veterans and carers," he said.Pete Lumb, from Hornsea, a small seaside town in the East Riding area of Yorkshire, is one of the individuals that has received a court summons.He is unemployed and has suffered with mental health problems. Living in a small bedsit, he says he has around £70 a week to live on.Since April, the council has been asking him for a few pounds a week extra towards the council tax - money he says he simply doesn't have."The chances of me getting a job are pretty much nil. I feel society just wants rid of me. I feel a complete and utter failure," he says.He's worried the next step will be bailiffs coming round.East Riding Council said that the changes to council tax benefit were "entirely the result of government policy and not anything decided by this council".It has encouraged anyone struggling to pay council tax to contact the authority at the earliest possible stage.Before April of this year, millions of people on low income in England paid no council tax at all, or had their bill substantially reduced. The council tax benefit system was then replaced.The government said this was part of a wider package of changes designed to control the spiralling cost of welfare - and encourage councils to find ways of helping those on benefits into work.It reduced the overall level of funding by 10% and said each council should decide how much support to offer residents - although pensioners were protected from any cut.Some councils managed to find savings elsewhere and absorb the funding reduction, thereby maintaining the level of support for low-income households. The benefit cuts were not passed on in Scotland or Wales.The majority of authorities in England, however, said they had no option but to ask some of the poorest residents for money. Many had never paid council tax before.Often, these residents have been asked for just a few pounds a week extra. But that can add up to hundreds of pounds a year.Already there have been reports of queues forming outside magistrates courts on certain days of the week, as the number of cases of non-payment increases.The Citizens Advice Bureau in Hull said it dealt with 1,000 cases last August, but by this August the number had risen to 3,000.But Mr Lewis said Labour's survey was "shoddy" and that official statistics "show arrears have fallen, and the amount of council tax collected has increased"."It is nothing like a full survey of the country," he told BBC Radio 5Live."I think it is really bad that the Labour Party just want to use something like this to scaremonger and to make political points in what is a really serious issue about dealing with our welfare problems."Mr Lewis said a £100m hardship fund had been made available to councils to support people struggling to pay their council tax, on top of the funding already given to local government."There is no interest for a council to get in a situation where people can't pay and they should be working with people...to ensure that they can protect the most vulnerable," he added."They don't need to be increasing the charges on people."The government does not have its own figures for the number of court summonses since April.Officials emphasise that every year there are a high number of court summonses for non-payment of council tax.Labour said it had asked councils for specific numbers of cases as a result of the changes to council tax benefit, so the total in its survey represents the extra number of summonses - those people who haven't paid council tax until now, or have been asked to pay more since April.</body>

      <title>A list for living, not a bucket list</title>
      <description>What 50 experiences would you want before you died?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477163</url>
      <date>1381454569</date>
      <body>Many people now make bucket lists. The BBC's Helen Fawkes explores the experiences people want before they die, and her own "list for living".What would you do if you found out that your time was limited? If you were told that you could be dead within months, you certainly had no more than five years to live?Well, that's the situation which I'm facing. On Christmas Eve last year I found out that I had incurable ovarian cancer. I felt waves of shock, sadness and anger. But I also knew that once I'd come to terms with the devastating news, I was going to make the most of the time I had left.A few days before the diagnosis, as I waited for one of many medical appointments, I thought about the things I might never do. I started to write down some of the stuff in my reporter's notebook. This was the start of my bucket list.Getting a dog, exploring the ancient ruins in Rome, taking a speed boat down the Thames, having my book published, learning to play poker and seeing penguins in the South Pole are just some of the 50 things I want to do.This has become known as a bucket list because it's all the things you want to achieve before you kick the bucket. But I don't like the term. I'd rather focus on the living, not the dying. I prefer to call it my "list for living".This cancer business is so horrific that it can easily take over your identity. Having this gives you something else to focus on and makes you feel like you again. So far I've managed to do 10 of them. I've pulled a pint in my local pub, I went to Paris with a group of friends just for lunch, modelled in a fashion show and zoomed down a zip wire. Next weekend I will present a Radio 4 programme, Pick of the Week, which will mean another big tick.But what's most important to me is right at the top of the list - move to the countryside and live in my own house. This is also what I wrote down in my notepad while I waited at hospital back in the winter. A couple of months ago I finally got my own home in a village. It needs lots of work to coax it out of the 1980s but once its done I'll be able to live there. It's an incredible feeling doing something I've wanted for years.I'm not sure I'll ever get to do everything on my bucket list but Susan Spencer-Wendel, from Florida, is someone who has. Susan is terminally ill with ALS, or motor neurone disease, an incurable condition which destroys the nerves that power her muscles.Susan realised that she had around a year left of relatively good health so she went on all the trips she wanted to with her loved ones. This included going to see the Northern Lights with her best friend and wedding dress shopping in New York with her teenage daughter - something she knew she'd never get to do for real.Susan wrote about her story in Until I say Goodbye: My Year of Living with Joy - A book she tapped out on an iPhone using just one thumb. She told me that her joy came from getting the best possible outcome from the worst of circumstances."I discovered the depth of love I have for the people around me and the depth of love they have for me. I discovered friends I never knew I had. And this lifts me each and every hour."Just like Susan, my list for living is about taking back some control. When you're told that you could die soon, many of your future plans are shattered. Life revolves around tests, treatments and trying desperately to feel well.My bucket list has given me some kind of a structure. There are no excuses anymore. You have to get on and do things rather than thinking you must do it someday. It's almost like giving pleasure a priority, in doing so you create powerful memories. I have one friend who must have spent hundreds of hours at hospital with me so it was really special to be able to do something totally unconnected with cancer and go glass-blowing.My list for living has made me realise that when I'm taking part in something I enjoy I feel so much better. It gives me a real boost. In May, I went to see Stonehenge at sunrise with a friend. As soon as I stood inside the ancient stone circle it was like my chemo fog lifted.For a magical hour, just the two of us watched night turn into day. As we left, the spell was broken. Not long afterwards I felt so chronically ill that I was barely able to walk.This was near to the end of some very toxic treatment. What helped to get me through it all was my plan to recover afterwards on a ridiculously perfect beach. It was so chilly and wet at times that I needed my coat but I had a blissful time in Cornwall. It was number five on my list so this shows you how badly I wanted the holiday. It's so vital to have something to look forward to. I may be fighting a killer disease but I still need some hope in my life.I used to be very sporty and I still crave that adrenalin rush so I picked a few things like sky diving and swimming with sharks just because they would terrify me. I haven't yet been brave enough to do those. But I have been driven very fast around a racetrack. A friend arranged for the ex-Formula 1 star David Coulthard to drive me around Silverstone. The speed was so exhilarating that I couldn't even scream to start with. It's funny how being scared to death can make you feel so alive.One of the reasons I responded to my diagnosis with a bucket list was because of a book I'd recently read, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. Bronnie Ware looked after terminally ill people in Australia. She realised that many of them shared the same concerns. For example, they wished they hadn't worked so hard and they'd allowed themselves to be happy.When I interviewed Bronnie for my documentary she told me that one of her favourite clients was a woman called Grace. She always wanted to travel but didn't because of her husband."She was a lady who spent her life in a very unhappy, dominating marriage. Her husband went into a nursing home because he was ill. She then became terminally ill within a few weeks of gaining the freedom that she had waited 50 or 60 years for. So she actually never got to live any of those dreams and she insisted on me promising her that I would live a life true to myself," Bronnie explained.I'm glad that I don't have any big regrets. This is partly down to another bucket list that I made. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with cancer for the very first time. While I was ill from the evil chemo cocktails I couldn't do anything but think about what I wanted to do once I was well again. I came up with a list of 10 things. Within weeks of finishing treatment I was in Moscow, pursuing my dream of becoming a BBC foreign correspondent.I'm clearly a fan of bucket lists but I understand that they're not for everyone. I wonder whether they create too much pressure to try to cram in everything? Psychotherapist Philippa Perry is worried that some people may have one for the wrong reasons."My first reaction is to think of it in terms of a shopping list. It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It's not about being alive, it's about going through the motions."My aim is not just to have things to tick off but to be left with a whole load of special memories with the people who mean the most to me. I know that when I'm dying and I'm too sick to do anything else they will be at my bedside reminding me about our adventures.Like the time we went to Paris. How we ended up at a beautiful cocktail bar in the middle of the afternoon after a long lunch. Another customer remarked that we sounded like we were having a lot of fun and asked me what we were celebrating. After an embarrassing moment, I told her we were celebrating life.Helen's list for living: 1) Live in my own house (almost done), 2) Move to the country (almost done), 3) Get a dog, 4) Play a netball game, again, 5) Recover from chemo on a ridiculously perfect beach (done), 6) See penguins in the South Pole, 7) Go to Paris by Eurostar just for lunch (done), 8) Visit Pompeii and drive along the Amalfi coast, 9) Explore the ancient ruins in Rome, 10) Snorkel on a coral reef, 11) Trek in Nepal, 12) Go to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, 13) See the Northern Lights, 14) Ride a camel across a desert, 15) Drink a mojito in Cuba, 16) See Stonehenge at sunrise (Done), 17) Go into space, 18) Get married, 19) Get my book published, 20) Present a BBC Radio 4 programme, 21) Hold an exhibition of my cow photographs, 22) Do voluntary work, 23) Run a 5K, 24) Skydive, 25) Go gliding, 26) Ride a horse through Hyde Park, 27) Try kite surfing, 28) Zoom down a zip wire (done), 29) Surf somewhere hot, 30) Go coasteering somewhere cold, 31) Take a speed boat down the Thames, 32) Swing on a trapeze, 33) Fly in a hot air balloon, 34) Take a private jet over London, 35) Fly in a stealth airplane, 36) Be driven very fast around a race track in a sports car (done), 37) Sleep under the stars, 38) Get a tattoo, 39) Have a henna crown painted on my baldy head once the hair falls out, 40) Grow my hair long, again, 41) Be a model and work the catwalk (done), 42) Learn to play poker, 43) Pull a pint in a proper pub (done), 44) Hold a party in a castle, 45) Go glass-blowing (done), 46) See puffins in UK, 47) Swim with sharks, 48) Sail alongside a pod of dolphins at sea, 49) Catch fireflies in a jar, 50) Drink champagne in one of the best bars in the world just before Christmas to celebrate still being alive.Helen Fawkes shares her list for living on BBC World Service at 08:06 GMT (09:06 BST on) on Monday 14 OctoberFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>National Trust 'failing' tenants</title>
      <description>National Trust tenants claim they are being badly treated</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24461918</url>
      <date>1381500824</date>
      <body>The High Peak area of Derbyshire forms a beautiful rugged landscape. Like so much of Britain's uplands, it is countryside preserved and protected by the National Trust.Many of the traditional stone cottages dotted across the hills are Trust owned, providing homes for some of its 6,500 tenants.But according the the National Trust's own tenants' association, it too often fails in its basic duty as a landlord.One of the cottages has been home to the Dean family since last year. Carl and Wendy Dean say moving to the picturesque property with their four children was a dream come true.But in a few weeks, they will be required to pack up and move out.It's a bitter blow, especially after they've just spent £6,000 improving the property. They've fitted a new kitchen, new flooring and redecorated.No-one is saying the National Trust is breaking the law, or even the rules.The Deans did only sign an initial six-month contract, but they expected it to be extended.They say they were told by a National Trust representative that being able to stay long term was "standard practice" if they were good tenants - an assurance the Trust say was never made.Standing in their front room Wendy is sobbing: "It's appalling. We are devastated. It's made me feel ill. We are not expecting them to change their minds. We know we are going but we don't want this to happen to somebody else."Her husband says: "We are being moved out like you would move cattle around. They don't care that we are a family, they've just said, 'Right, your time is up.'"The Tenants' Association of the National Trust (TANT) says there are growing problems across the country, with their helpline taking calls about poor repairs, rising rents - and, increasingly, tenancy disputes.Andrew Turner Cross is a long-time Trust tenant. He is also chairman of TANT."What we're looking for is a fair deal for tenants, we're getting all too many calls on our helpline to do with the same old problems - leases, repairs and rental increases… some of those cases are quite heartbreaking."Of course, thousands of tenants live happily in National Trust properties, and it says it simply doesn't recognise reports of widespread discontent.Clearly, caring for and maintaining old, sometimes ancient housing stock is difficult and costly.Mary Marshall has been a Trust tenant in West Wycombe for more than two decades. She describes it as a first-class landlord.And she says her fellow tenants should make allowances for the fact they live in such desirable properties."I think you have to accept that you are moving into a part of history," she says."You are part of the history of the country and the buildings. And it is a privilege to live in a place like this. You need to accept that the Trust are doing everything in their power to conserve it."But the BBC has seen an internal report that suggests there is also some serious dissatisfaction.The survey - commissioned by the National Trust itself - concludes that although 72% of tenants are happy, there is a "disconnect between tenants' and landlords' expectations".It also says: "The National Trust falls short of the 'special' expectations of them but also of the basic expectations of a landlord."The National Trust's rural enterprise director, Patrick Begg, says: "It's not a damning indictment. I don't think it's universal, I think the vast majority of what we do, we get right, in places we don't."I can't say enough times, I don't recognise that picture. We stand behind our role as a professional and fair landlord. We are always striving to do better, of course, but with a track record of success."But among the significant number of National Trust tenants who are unhappy is hill farmer Neil Priestly.When land next to his existing National Trust farm came up for rent, he jumped at chance to grow his business, paying out thousands for sheep especially suited to this hard landscapeAgain, he was on a fixed contract. Again, he says he was told it would be renewed after 12 months as a formality.But the Trust denies this and now requires him to move on."If they'd come and from the start said this is what the plan is going to be, but a total lack of communication and a lack of regard for my own personal financial well being or anything like that, they've just ploughed on, on this road that they've set off down, with total disregard for local people," he said.The National Trust is among our best loved, best supported charities. The uncomfortable message from some of its tenants is that it is better at conserving buildings and landscapes than looking after the people who rely on it for their homes.</body>

      <title>When Danger Mouse ruled the roost</title>
      <description>David Jason finds out what happened to Cosgrove Hall</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24429892</url>
      <date>1381457414</date>
      <body>Thirty years ago children's cartoon Danger Mouse topped the TV ratings, beating even Coronation Street. But what happened to the legendary Manchester animation house Cosgrove Hall Films, which created the rodent secret agent?Voiced by Only Fools And Horses star David Jason, Danger Mouse was the flagship of Cosgrove Hall Films, based in a quirky studio in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy.Vibrant, surreal and deliciously silly, an astonishing 21 million viewers tuned in to watch it in 1983, a record for a children's programme which has yet to be beaten."I used to race home from school to watch it and tape it," remembers comedian Natalie Haynes. "Then I'd watch the tape over and over again."For other people, there was Top of The Pops, for me there was Danger Mouse. If I had kids, I'd be scared to try and introduce them to Danger Mouse, because what if they didn't like it? I could put up with them being noisy and making a mess, but if they didn't like Danger Mouse, I'd hate them."Danger Mouse - who was joined by bumbling sidekick Penfold, voiced by comic actor Terry Scott, as he took on the evil Baron Silas Greenback - has been shown in more than 80 countries.A curiously British cartoon, it parodied James Bond and was influenced by Monty Python's anarchic humour.The titular hero literally lived down the street from Sherlock Holmes - his lair was underneath a post box next to 221b Baker Street.The show's co-creators Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall say the show was modelled on Patrick McGoohan's 1960s TV show Danger Man.In 2006, Hall told the BBC why he thought Danger Mouse was so successful: "The adults watched because of that kind of anarchy. The kids watched it because they just loved the stories and the absolutely stupid gags."Haynes agrees: "Danger Mouse is based on that purely British humour, like Monty Python, that so lacks any of that London-based cosmopolitan pomposity."The people that made it just set out to make kids laugh. It's just the joyous, innocence of the jokes that I love."Things like the Scottish character called Mac the Fork, who's a snake with a forked tongue and who has a brother called Mac the Spoon, and then there's another character called 'Dudley Poison', why wouldn't you enjoy them?"As for the permanently-terrified Penfold, Cosgrove says: "Mark said to me, 'You know what you've done, don't you? You've drawn your brother'. And bless him he was right. It was pretty close."My brother always wore a suit and he was bald and he wore heavy-rimmed glasses. He worked at the Sunday Express in Manchester and they all started calling him Penfold," chuckles the animator.Danger Mouse was the first international hit for Cosgrove Hall, whose animated series also included Count Duckula; Jamie and the Magic Torch; The Wind in the Willows and Cockleshell Bay.The animation studio was a breeding ground for some of Britain's best animators, says Professor Paul Wells, director of the animation academy at Loughborough University,"One of the most important things about Cosgrove Hall is that they really established Manchester as an important centre for British animation production and of course they spawned other companies like Mackinnon and Saunders (The Corpse Bride) and really helped with the careers of internationally renowned animators like Barry Purves."Purves, who later worked at Aardman Animations, and then on Peter Jackson's King Kong movie, says: "From animators I know at Pixar and Disney... many of them have a great fondness, particularly for Danger Mouse, and they very much enjoy its Monty Python, Goodie-esque type silly, surreal British sense of humour"I know they have it in the back of their minds when they are thinking of their own gags."He also recalls an incident when the Israeli embassy complained about another Cosgrove Hall series, Chorlton and the Wheelies.Brian Trueman, who wrote the script, explains: "We were accused of anti-Semitism because (the witch) Fenella Fellorick had a German talking spell book."On the front of the spell book it should have the magic symbol of witchcraft, the pentagram. But the guy who was making the model found that doing two triangles overlaid on one another was a lot easier to make so he slapped the Star of David on the front of it."He giggles as he remembers: "That brought claims that it was an anti-Semitic show. I think they were reassured that it was absolutely nothing of the kind."Cosgrove Hall's back catalogue also includes Roald Dahl's The BFG; Engie Benjy; and Kenny Everett's animated space adventure Captain Kremmen; as well as several animated episodes of Doctor Who.But Danger Mouse remains its most enduring character.Sir David Jason created his voice, imbuing the masked rodent with a high-handed manner that turned the most innocent of phrases - "Good grief!" - into an instant catchphrase.He also played the show's narrator, a character in his own right who became increasingly exasperated with having to say "meanwhile" as he linked the show's scenes.Sir David, now 73, says: "I was first attracted to Danger Mouse by the standard of character animation - I feel very fortunate to have been a part of the creative process of these two fantastic animators."For their adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, I was originally cast as Rat but I really felt that I wanted to offer them a different take on Toad."As manipulative as he was, I always felt that Toad must have a softer side in order to attract such nice friends and so I tried to make him more of a loveable rogue. Brian and Mark listened to my interpretation and thankfully agreed that I should play Toad instead."We always had such a successful working relationship coupled with such fun which we hope came through in the various animations we made together."Sir David is not the only famous alumnus of the studio - Bernard Sumner of Joy Division and New Order worked there from 1976 to 1979; while The Stone Roses guitarist, John Squire, made models for The Wind In The Willows.The company ran into trouble in 1991 when its parent company Thames Television lost its London ITV franchise and was forced to sell it off.Anglia TV bought Cosgrove Hall but it retained only a handful of staff, and began to shift its emphasis.Chris Bowman, a former executive producer, says they began to create animation for other TV productions, like Postman Pat; Fifi and the Flowertots; and Roary the Racing Car, and saw "a second golden age".They were also entrusted by the BBC to make updated versions of Noddy, Andy Pandy and Bill and Ben.Professor Wells says: "They weren't frightened of taking what you might call iconic children's entertainment vehicles like Bill and Ben and remaking them."The company also created the BBC's first cartoon webcast and made the animated ushers who greeted visitors to the Millennium Dome exhibition in London.In 2008, ITV decided to pull the plug on Cosgrove Hall and sell off its studios.Professor Wells says the company was a bit slow to react to the multi-channel world and the growth in imports of US cartoons like Ren and Stimpy.Those "were a little more excessive, a little more adult, looking at a teenage crossover market, and Cosgrove Hall didn't react efficiently enough."When the old Cosgrove Hall studios in Chorlton closed in 2010 dozens of former workers, including Purves, turned up to say goodbye.Hall died of cancer, in 2011, aged 74.By then the studios had been demolished, to make way for retirement flats.But it appears the story is not quite over.Last month, it was announced that Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Entertainment was moving into a business park in Didsbury, Manchester, and taking on 40 animators and graphic designers, with plans for a further 70 jobs.Listen to Crikey DM! David Jason's tribute to Cosgrove Hall on BBC Radio 4 at 10:30 BST on Saturday 12 October. Or catch it later on the BBC iPlayer.</body>

      <title>Delhi prepares for baton arrival</title>
      <description>The Commonwealth Games baton makes its first overseas stop</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24485379</url>
      <date>1381446977</date>
      <body>The Queen's Baton Relay arrives at its first international destination today and it's a city which, three years ago, had observers like me on the edge of their seats.Delhi, the capital of India, was host city for the Commonwealth Games in 2010.There were predictions that the whole event would be in jeopardy because venue construction was way behind schedule.As teams arrived at the athletes village, concerns were raised that it was unfinished and dirty.But somehow everything came good and the opening ceremony was the dazzling spectacle that was needed to mark the end of controversy and the commencement of sport.Three years on and as the Queen's baton begins the build-up to the Glasgow games, I have returned to Delhi to see what legacy has been left.First stop is Pragati Maidan metro station, part of a network which has only been in existence for ten years and which was expanded for and beyond the games.At a cost of £2bn it is ultra-modern and takes two million people into the heart of the capital each day.One man emerging from the station tell me: "Driving is hell in Delhi, especially when you are commuting between Noida, Delhi and Gurgaon."It's difficult but with the metro it is so easy, you don't have to worry about traffic, you don't have to worry about accidents."A female resident adds: "That's the most convenient and comfortable way to commute in Delhi itself. That's the lifeline of Delhi."Before the metro she says "it was time consuming, hectic and now it's hazard free".But the metro hasn't exactly restored calm to this chaotic country.Although it carries two million people every day, the roads here are still hectic and packed with cars, buses, tuk-tuks and a range of unconventional transport means.Road markings still show a separate "games lane" for traffic, although that regulation is treated with the same disregard by drivers as many other rules.Even since the closing ceremony, the problems for the Commonwealth Games continued, culminating is the jailing of the Organising Committee's Chairman, Suresh Kalmadi, on corruption charges.The games cost £2.5bn and were ten times over budget.Politicians here don't want to talk about it, especially in the month before a local election.In fact the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, cancelled a planned interview with me at the last minute.Instead it was left to Dr A Didar Singh, Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce, to robustly defend Delhi's reputation.He told me: "First of all there was a massive investment and business benefits from that, almost $12bn worth of work happened."But I think more important that that is that it has given to us a permanent improved infrastructure for the city as a whole."The sports part is one end of it but more than ninety percent of the funding went into improving the city infrastructure."He cites 25 new flyovers, walkways, a new airport and hotel space as a tremendous boost to tourism.He adds: "Tourism, basically, means more business."Improvements have come in the main business and retail district, Connaught Place, which was due for a total renovation.It was supposed to be transformed in time for the 2010 games but work only started post-games and they're still finishing it off.International finance firm Grant Thornton India has a base in Connaught Place.Vishesh Chandoik, National Managing Partner, said: "We are used to most infrastructure projects in India suffering from time over runs so I wasn't surprised."But I was still very happy and think the end result is substantially better than we had before."There is still a lot that can be done but it's about being better tomorrow than we are today and as long as they keep making those improvements I've got no reason to complain."While admiring the iconic India Gate, the giant archway which commemorates those lost in war, I was aggressively herded away with the other tourists, which seemingly happens at five o'clock every day.It's maybe not the way tourists would be handled back home but illustrates the many cultural differences between here and the west.Passive observers in Glasgow might wonder how, precisely, Delhi benefited from the games when the city's reputation was torn to shreds by the many issues.But the reality is that this city is changing.The question is whether the games brought about the changes or whether they were used to symbolise them.Next week BBC Scotland will examine what sporting legacy the Delhi games created.</body>

      <title>Disabled access stuck on red light?</title>
      <description>Disabled rail access stuck on red light?</description>

      <body>More than 1,000 of the UK's 2,500 railway stations need "urgent" upgrades to help disabled people, the government has said. But while efforts to improve the situation are being made, some disabled passengers in the West Midlands fear their problems could continue for years.One commuter who faces the problems on a daily basis is 30-year-old David Lewis. A wheelchair user due to chronic arthritis, Mr Lewis travels the country giving talks on his condition.However, he cannot use his local train station in Acocks Green in Birmingham as it has no disability access at all."I have regular appointments at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham," he said."To get there by train should be free, due to my rail pass."But because I cannot access my nearest station, Acocks Green, at all, I have to pay about £15 per trip in a black cab."He added: "Some stations are not even manned in the evening; and lifts are closed down in the evening too, so even if you can get there, there is nobody to assist you."If I am travelling by train now, it takes days of preparation. I have to use the internet to find stations that allow access to disabled people and plot a route that way."The situation in London is a lot easier, but here in the Midlands, it is not so good. Not enough is being done."Efforts to remedy the situation are ongoing, the government says. The DfT's Access for All fund is a pot of £100m to cover access improvements to more than 150 stations in England, Wales and Scotland between 2014 and 2019.However, it has said it cannot guarantee when the improvements will be delivered to hundreds of stations nationwide that are not yet on this list.In the West Midlands, Birmingham's New Street Station welcomes 31 million commuters through its doors each year. All platforms have lifts and escalators, all entrances have automatic doors and wheelchairs can be provided if needed.Yet within a few miles of New Street, 14 of the 69 West Midlands region's stations are in need of disabled access upgrades but with no indication of when they will get them.For many, the timetable for improvements is not good enough. Residents in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, complain their local station is not listed for improvements via the fund.Their MP, Joan Walley, says she plans to raise the matter in Parliament."I have become increasingly frustrated at the lack of disabled access," she said. "The current situation is unacceptable."Just a few miles down the track, Stoke-on-Trent's station has full disabled access but eight of the 22 stations in Staffordshire are without similar facilities - and currently have no timetable for improvements.Others stations around the region, like their counterparts around the country, have ramp access to one or two platforms, but only stair access to others; drastically limiting the travel opportunities of wheelchair users.A spokesman for the DfT said: "The Access for All programme is currently delivering step-free access at over 150 stations. Other access improvements, such as hand rails, will be delivered to over 1,000 stations due to the programme."While we cannot guarantee which stations will be included, a further £100m will extend the programme from 2015 to 2019."Stations across the country included in the extended programme are due to be named in early 2014. Until then, the daily struggle for thousands of disabled commuters continues.</body>

      <description>Papers focus on energy price rise</description>

      <body>"Eat or heat" is the choice facing millions of households according to the Daily Express after SSE became the first of the big energy companies to announce an increase in bills.The claim comes from pensioner groups who say the elderly will be the hardest hit as the weather turns colder.The Daily Mirror's headline goes further, declaring that "fuel bills will kill". A fuel poverty adviser tells the paper he is "fearful" there will be an increase in deaths this winter.Most of the papers agree that other energy companies will now follow suit. Fat cat firms are set to stick two fingers up at Britain, says the Sun.The paper demands that the government increases competition in the energy market and slashes green taxes.But the Times wants consumers to take on some responsibility for reducing bills - it suggests putting on a sweater and using less energy.The Daily Telegraph reports that ministers are being urged to initiate an immediate review of Britain's entire green energy strategy or risk forcing household gas and electricity bills up every year for the rest of the decade.The chief executive of SSE tells the paper that bills would fall overnight if the government opted to pay for green energy subsidies through the tax system.But the Times says David Cameron has been warned that reducing green levies on energy companies would land the government in court.The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group says that an attempt to water down the scheme would be a derogation of the government's obligation to do all it reasonably can to eradicate fuel poverty.Labour leader Ed Miliband uses the news of the price increase to repeat his pledge to freeze energy bills for 20 months after the election.In an interview with the Financial Times, he accuses the energy companies of being guilty of "predatory behaviour" and he says the government is "frozen in inaction".Writing in the Daily Express, Mr Miliband accuses the Conservatives of siding with energy firms.But the Daily Mail argues that Mr Miliband was the architect of the green taxes, which are blamed for pushing up bills, when he was in charge of energy policy in Gordon Brown's government.Writing in the Guardian, Margaret Atwood welcomes the news that the Nobel Prize for literature has been won by a fellow Canadian author, Alice Munro.She says it is a thrilling honour for a major writer and will draw international attention, not only to women's writing and Canadian writing, but the often overlooked short story.The Independent's literary editor believes the world's most solemn literary prize has gone to a modest, immaculate but far-sighted miniaturist.If you are worried that children are growing up more interested in iPads than fairy tales then you are not alone, says the Daily Mail.The Queen is apparently concerned that children are more likely to play computer games or read e-books than settle down with a traditional story.The Mail says the comments were made as author Joanne Harris was presented with her MBE - the paper notes that it is "highly unusual" for the Queen to openly express an opinion on such issues.</body>

      <body>A man died from a caffeine overdose after eating too many high-energy mints, an inquest heard.John Jackson was found dead at his home in Wednesbury, West Midlands, on 2 May after eating Hero Instant Energy Mints.The 40-year-old had twice the recommended adult daily caffeine intake in his blood.Coroner Robin Balmain, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, said he would contact the Department of Health to see if action should be taken.Mr Jackson's daughter, Rebecca Court, 23, said her father had treated the energy products "like they were any other mint"."There is a warning on them, but it's tiny and in the shops they're sold next to all the other mints," she said."It's scary. I think they should be sold behind the counter."Speaking after the inquest, Mr Balmain said: "I think the public need to know about these mints."Each one contains as much caffeine as the leading energy drink."There are people who constantly chew on sweets."If they eat these mints, they might ingest a huge amount of caffeine without knowing it."Mr Jackson, from Walsall Road, had a liver condition which was a contributory factor in his death.However, the cause of death was given as caffeine toxicity.Mr Balmain said he had never come across caffeine overdose as a cause of death before.He could not say how many of the sweets Mr Jackson had eaten before his death, or whether the deceased man was aware of their high caffeine content."He may not have have been aware of the dangers - I think there's a strong possibility of that," Mr Balmain said."These mints cost £4 for a packet of 12 but, nevertheless, they are mints and people may treat them as sweets."A spokesperson for Hero Energy said they were shocked at the news of Mr Jackson's death.He said the company was very vocal about the associated risks of caffeine consumption."We have many satisfied customers and their health and safety is very important to us," he said."We will continue to strive for greater levels of consumer education, so customers can make informed decisions about all caffeinated products."</body>

      <body>The remains of two people have been found in a back garden in Nottinghamshire, police have confirmed.Officers said human remains were found in the garden of a property in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, on Thursday.Police said they were led to the address after information came to light about an "incident" alleged to have taken place in the late 1990s.A neighbour said an elderly couple had lived in the property in the 1990s but had disappeared.The 51-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, said the couple were living at the house when she moved in 18 years ago.She said: "They never had any visitors. I never saw anyone coming or going."My friend and I always used to say, 'I wonder what happened to that couple'. They just disappeared. We thought they had emigrated."Nottinghamshire Police said it could not comment on the claim.Insp Mark Webster said it could be "several weeks or months" before the bodies were formally identified.He said the current owners of the house were not part of the investigation at this time and confirmed no arrests had been made.A post-mortem examination to establish the causes of death was being carried out on Friday.Mr Webster appealed for anyone with information on the discovery to come forward but said residents should not be fearful."We don't believe that there is any risk of any harm coming to the community," he added."People are clearly going to be concerned when an incident of this nature happens and we would like to reassure them."The property remains cordoned off while forensic examinations are carried out.</body>

      <description>A wealthy London woman was murdered by two "compulsive gamblers" in order to steal her property and financial assets, a court hears.</description>

      <body>A wealthy woman was murdered by two "compulsive gamblers" in order to steal her property and financial assets, a court has heard.Carole Waugh, 50, disappeared from her home in Marylebone, central London, in May last year and her remains were found three months later.The Old Bailey heard that Rakesh Bhayani, 41, and Nicholas Kutner, 48, had killed Miss Waugh in order to feed their gambling habit.The pair deny murdering Miss Waugh.Patrick Gibbs QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the men "had a taste for grand and expensive things and were gripped by the same compulsion to gamble".Miss Waugh's body was found in the boot of a car in a garage in New Malden in August 2012.Tests showed she had been stabbed in the neck.Mr Gibbs told the court that "the Crown cannot say whose hand was on the weapon"."But whoever struck the fatal blow, we say that Mr Bhayani and Mr Kutner planned it, and were responsible for it, and having taken her life, they then systematically took all her worldly goods as well."The prosecution claim that the men had a history of tricking and defrauding people.The court heard that once Miss Waugh was dead, Mr Bhayani got a number of women to impersonate the former accounts clerk on the telephone.He then "rehearsed" the women so they could strip Miss Waugh of her assets in shops and banks by using her credit cards.After her death, Miss Waugh's identity was also used to buy gold bullion and Krugerrands, the jury was told.Mr Gibb said the women would not be on trial as the prosecution would focus on the murder of Miss Waugh and the concealment of her murder.He said Miss Waugh had not had a regular job, but had worked as an accounts clerk in Libya in the oil industry and was "a woman who had plenty of money"."That was to prove her undoing," he said."She owned her flat, worth more than £600,000, she had savings, shares, jewellery and a cash income from working as an amateur escort."He told the court that Miss Waugh had known Mr Bhayani for a while, had visited him in prison and lent him £40,000."It seems that she had been intimate with him at one time or another in the past [and] may have first met him through an advertisement of herself as an escort that she had placed on the internet."Like everyone else that has met Mr Bhayani, she was taken in by him."She thought that he was her friend, but you may decide by the end of this trial that Mr Bhayani doesn't really do friends."He said that Mr Bhayani had been released from prison, "knowing how much she had, he planned that she should die".He add that Miss Waugh had known Mr Kutner less well and had not been intimate with him.The trial continues.</body>

      <body>Three prisoners are holding a roof-top protest at HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton.A spokeswoman for G4S, which runs the prison near Wolverhampton, said: "We can confirm that an incident involving three prisoners is taking place at HMP Oakwood."The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has been alerted, she added.The Chief Inspector of Prisons has criticised the prison for failing to tackle drug issues.The report published on Tuesday found inmates said it was easier to obtain drugs than soap at the prison.The Prison Ombudsman, Nigel Newcomen QC, has also criticised the emergency response by prison staff when one of its inmates stopped breathing.Edward Ham, 54, was declared dead in his cell in February.Mr Newcomen said his treatment had been "unacceptably poor" and a summary of his report found staff could not access a defibrillator as it was locked away.HMP Oakwood opened in April 2012 and houses about 1,600 inmates.In July it was one of two private prisons to receive the Ministry of Justice's lowest rating.The MoJ declined to comment on Friday's protest.</body>

      <title>Fatal stabbings prompt knife amnesty</title>
      <description>A knife amnesty is to be held in Birmingham following five fatal stabbings since March.</description>

      <body>A knife amnesty is to be held in Birmingham following five fatal stabbings since March.The Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, Bob Jones, announced the plans after a meeting about the issue between the force and Birmingham City Council.Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said knife crime was falling.Derrick Campbell, a former government advisor on knife crime, said an amnesty would not make a difference.Speaking on Thursday, PCC Mr Jones said: "We haven't agreed the final details, we have agreed in principle that it's going to happen."We need to work through how it's going to work, how it's going to be publicised, and that's part of the task that we do have ahead."But Mr Campbell, who founded and chaired the group Birmingham Reducing Gang Violence, said he had been involved in three knife amnesties in the past."Unless they are targeted and time limited they aren't effective," he said."They do very little to deter people who are determined to carry a knife and there won't be a real drop in crime."All it does is provide an opportunity for people to get rid of old rusty blades. For something meaningful to happen it's about changing people's attitudes to carrying knives."Imposing tougher custodial sentences would have a more positive impact on reducing knife crime, he added.The PCC said he wanted the idea of a knife amnesty discussed by the 200 young people who will be at a youth summit he is hosting on 3 December."We want this to be something that works and resonates with young people to make sure that whatever the strategy is, it's meaningful," Mr Jones said.Mr Jones praised the ideas on tackling knife crime that came from an "excellent debate" organised by BBC WM.West Midlands Police launched the Knives cost Lives campaign in January.There have been five fatal stabbings in the city since March, including 15-year-old Hassan Mahmood in July and 16-year-old Christina Edkins, who was stabbed on a bus in March.Her killer, Phillip Simelane, from Walsall, has been detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.According to figures released by police, knife crime in Birmingham dropped by 25% between April 2011 and 2012.In 2012-13, there were 1,615 knife-related incidents in the city, although police said over the past six years knife crime had fallen by 63% across the force area.Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Overall knife crime is falling and a higher proportion of people are going to prison for knife possession than in previous years."It's encouraging that cautions have fallen and those who have previously been caught carrying a knife are twice as likely to go to prison."</body>

      <body>Police are investigating a "disgusting" cartoon video ridiculing an Essex mayor which was posted online.It features Basildon mayor Mo Larkin and includes a scene of her apparently giving birth to council leader Tony Ball.The video parodies a photograph taken of her on Armed Forces Day when she appeared to be looking at her phone while receiving a salute.Mr Ball said he and Mrs Larkin were "shocked" at the "disgusting" video."As politicians we expect to take the knocks and the bumps and you expect criticism when you put your head above the parapet," he added."But this goes well beyond that."A link to the online cartoon was sent to all members and officers at the council, Mr Ball said.The council then complained to police and workers were advised not to click on it.A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: "We are investigating allegations of malicious communications and inquiries are ongoing."No-one has yet been arrested, police say.After the photograph of Mrs Larkin on Armed Forces Day was circulated, the council opened an investigation into whether someone inside the council had taken the image to cause embarrassment to Mrs Larkin.Mr Ball said that investigation had not been successful in finding the person who had taken the image.Mrs Larkin is yet to comment on the matter.</body>

      <body>An abandoned pram prompted a security alert in Scarborough town centre.The pram, with wires coming from it, was found at the rear of Miss Selfridge in Westborough shortly before 09:00 BST, North Yorkshire Police said.An Army bomb disposal team was called in by police and carried out controlled explosions.A 100m cordon was put in place and shoppers and workers were evacuated from the area. Police lifted the cordon at around 13:30.North Yorkshire Police said the evacuation had been a "precaution" but they were confident the item had not been an explosive device.Acting Supt Mark Grange said: "The store had found a pram at the back of their premises which had wires visible and some sort of package attached to it."We treated it as you would do with a suspicious item and put in a cordon whilst we waited for the army bomb disposal unit."He said the overriding concern was public protection and officers had not overreacted."When you are dealing with crowded places we have to consider what the consequences would have been if it had been an explosive device."</body>

      <title>Baby P council failed another child</title>
      <description>The council criticised for its role in the Baby Peter and Victoria Climbie cases has failed another child, a review finds.</description>

      <date>1381476085</date>
      <body>The council responsible for Baby Peter and Victoria Climbie has failed another child, a serious case review has found.The four-year-old boy, known as Child T, suffered horrific abuse by his parents and was once found to have had more than 50 bruises on his body.He was twice taken to hospital but was returned to his mother and stepfather before being taken into care in 2011.The review by Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board found failings across several agencies.It detailed a weakness in following up collaborative investigations across police, social workers and medical staff, along with a failure to focus on what life was like for the boy and his three siblings.It also blamed a reluctance to "think the unthinkable" and recognise all the adults in the family as the perpetrators of abuse as well as a lack of alertness to the possibility of child abuse being the cause of his injuries.Referring to the case of Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, who died in August 2007 aged 13 months after sustained abuse by his mother, her boyfriend and his brother, the report's authors remarked: "The correspondence with the abuse of Peter Connelly cannot go unmarked."It added that the "list of concerns sounds like a textbook presentation of frequently-found weakness in the protection of children".In June 2010, Child T first came into contact with the authorities after he was taken to the AandE department at North Middlesex Hospital, in Edmonton, by his mother and stepfather.He had bruising around his eyes, forehead and nose, and swelling.His heroin addict stepfather, who, along with the boy's mother is Polish, told medics the boy often ran around and hit himself on the wall.A paediatrician who examined the child the next day said he should be referred to children's social care services, but the fax was mistakenly sent to Enfield instead of Haringey. Enfield Council referred it to Haringey days later.In February 2011, police were also called to the family home after Child T's mother accused his stepfather of being violent to both him and herself.The toddler was taken to hospital by police the following day where a doctor said his injuries were "highly suspicious".On one of the hospital visits, Child T told a doctor he was being hit with a belt and a stick by his stepfather.In a police interview, the stepfather, known as Mr C, denied injuring the child, claiming the mother and maternal grandmother, who lived with them, hit the child with a slipper.There were also claims that Child T's younger sister and older half-sister were abused by Mr C, and that he had tried to drown the older girl in the bath.The three children, and Child T's six-month-old half-sister were eventually taken into care.Mr C was sentenced to four years in prison in October 2011 for assaulting a person under the age of 16.Haringey Council leader Claire Kober said the case happened during a period of rebuilding their children's services."We fully accept the findings of this SCR and apologise unreservedly for the failings set out in the report," she said."We are committed to a culture of continued partnership working, learning and improvement...so that we can be confident that issues like those raised in this SCR are less likely to arise again."</body>

      <title>Firefighters confirm new strike date</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage a five-hour strike on 19 October amid a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <date>1381482146</date>
      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage a second strike on 19 October amid a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said.The five-hour strike by union members will take place from 18:30 until 23:30.The government plans to make firefighters work up to 60 and argues that the pension offer is generous.But FBU general secretary Matt Wrack says the late-50s is too old to be fighting fires and rescuing families and is not ruling out further strikes.Firefighters in Scotland will not strike after they voted in a consultation that Scottish government proposals were sufficient to prevent a strike, the FBU says.Mr Wrack said: "We had hoped our first strike was enough to show government that firefighters could not be more serious about protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions."No firefighter wants to strike, and it's desperately disappointing that governments in Westminster and Cardiff continue to deny reality over pensions costs and the need for a pension scheme that reflects the job firefighters do."Firefighters simply cannot be expected to fight fires and rescue families in their late 50s and into their 60s."We hope this second strike will mean both governments will be willing to discuss the full range of concerns that firefighters and the general public have expressed."However, more strikes cannot be ruled out if that's what it takes to protect public and firefighter safety from these ludicrous attacks."During the first strike on 25 September, 32,000 union members walked out for four hours, according to the FBU.Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-unionised fire crews and bringing in private contractors.The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work.No major incidents were reported during the strike, which was the first national walkout for a decade.</body>

      <body>Cleaners working on First Great Western trains have gone on strike over wages and zero-hour contracts.Railway Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members with contractor MITIE began a 24-hour walk-out at 06:00.They claim to be the operator's lowest-paid workers. An offer of a 2% wage rise, made earlier in the year, was rejected.MITIE said it had "full contingency plans" and was planning further talks with the RMT.RMT general secretary Bob Crow said it had been a "long fight" for workplace and pay justice and its union members had "shown guts and determination" throughout."Only last week First landed a jackpot rollover with a two-year contract extension on Great Western that will make them and their sub-contractors a fortune," he added."Justice says that now is the time for the cleaners out there day and night on First Great Western (FGW) to get their fair share through a Living Wage, decent sick pay and benefits and an end to the evil of zero hours contracts."The strike will run until 05:59 on Saturday.A FGW spokesman said the firm was working with MITIE, as its contractor, to ensure it met its contractual obligations.The firm operates trains across the Western region, carrying 1.5m passengers every week on 9,000 services and calling at 276 stations.</body>

      <body>A shop worker who beat his boss to death after he was challenged over the theft of £2,500 in takings has been jailed for life.Thilak Mohan-Raj, 25, had worked and lived at MK Food and Wine in Elstow Road in Bedford for only a few days when he murdered owner Vairamuthu Thiyagarajah, 56, on 7 April.The judge at Luton Crown Court said he must serve a minimum of 25 years.He was also given a two-year sentence for burglary, to run concurrently.During the trial, the court heard Mr Thiyagarajah confronted Mohan-Raj after finding the 25-year-old had taken the day's takings from a drawer in his locked bedroom and put them in his own room.Faced with the accusation, Mohan-Raj repeatedly struck the older man several times over the head with a heavy object.Mr Thiyagarajah, known locally as Appa, died in hospital four days later.Judge Richard Foster described it as a "merciless and ferocious" attack which left the victim with multiple fractures to the back of the skull.He told Mohan-Raj: "You took his life prematurely and cruelly at a time when he was reducing his work to enjoy his family and benefit from the fruits of his hard work."It was not a case of self defence. You are a young fit man and he was much older."Det Insp Liz Mead from the Beds and Herts Major Crime Unit said it was an "unplanned attack on a totally defenceless innocent man"."[Mr Thiyagarajah] took on Mohan-Raj a week before on a friend's recommendation and tragically his kindness was repaid by theft and murder," she said."In relation to the family, no matter what sentence was given .... it won't bring Appa back as they try to rebuild their lives."In a statement, the Thiyagarajah family said the loss of Appa had "left an unfillable void in all our lives".</body>

      <title>National Trust 'failing' tenants</title>
      <description>National Trust tenants across the country claim they are being badly treated, pushed out of their homes and left thousands of pounds out of pocket by the organisation, the BBC finds.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24461918</url>
      <date>1381500824</date>
      <body>The High Peak area of Derbyshire forms a beautiful rugged landscape. Like so much of Britain's uplands, it is countryside preserved and protected by the National Trust.Many of the traditional stone cottages dotted across the hills are Trust owned, providing homes for some of its 6,500 tenants.But according the the National Trust's own tenants' association, it too often fails in its basic duty as a landlord.One of the cottages has been home to the Dean family since last year. Carl and Wendy Dean say moving to the picturesque property with their four children was a dream come true.But in a few weeks, they will be required to pack up and move out.It's a bitter blow, especially after they've just spent £6,000 improving the property. They've fitted a new kitchen, new flooring and redecorated.No-one is saying the National Trust is breaking the law, or even the rules.The Deans did only sign an initial six-month contract, but they expected it to be extended.They say they were told by a National Trust representative that being able to stay long term was "standard practice" if they were good tenants - an assurance the Trust say was never made.Standing in their front room Wendy is sobbing: "It's appalling. We are devastated. It's made me feel ill. We are not expecting them to change their minds. We know we are going but we don't want this to happen to somebody else."Her husband says: "We are being moved out like you would move cattle around. They don't care that we are a family, they've just said, 'Right, your time is up.'"The Tenants' Association of the National Trust (TANT) says there are growing problems across the country, with their helpline taking calls about poor repairs, rising rents - and, increasingly, tenancy disputes.Andrew Turner Cross is a long-time Trust tenant. He is also chairman of TANT."What we're looking for is a fair deal for tenants, we're getting all too many calls on our helpline to do with the same old problems - leases, repairs and rental increases… some of those cases are quite heartbreaking."Of course, thousands of tenants live happily in National Trust properties, and it says it simply doesn't recognise reports of widespread discontent.Clearly, caring for and maintaining old, sometimes ancient housing stock is difficult and costly.Mary Marshall has been a Trust tenant in West Wycombe for more than two decades. She describes it as a first-class landlord.And she says her fellow tenants should make allowances for the fact they live in such desirable properties."I think you have to accept that you are moving into a part of history," she says."You are part of the history of the country and the buildings. And it is a privilege to live in a place like this. You need to accept that the Trust are doing everything in their power to conserve it."But the BBC has seen an internal report that suggests there is also some serious dissatisfaction.The survey - commissioned by the National Trust itself - concludes that although 72% of tenants are happy, there is a "disconnect between tenants' and landlords' expectations".It also says: "The National Trust falls short of the 'special' expectations of them but also of the basic expectations of a landlord."The National Trust's rural enterprise director, Patrick Begg, says: "It's not a damning indictment. I don't think it's universal, I think the vast majority of what we do, we get right, in places we don't."I can't say enough times, I don't recognise that picture. We stand behind our role as a professional and fair landlord. We are always striving to do better, of course, but with a track record of success."But among the significant number of National Trust tenants who are unhappy is hill farmer Neil Priestly.When land next to his existing National Trust farm came up for rent, he jumped at chance to grow his business, paying out thousands for sheep especially suited to this hard landscapeAgain, he was on a fixed contract. Again, he says he was told it would be renewed after 12 months as a formality.But the Trust denies this and now requires him to move on."If they'd come and from the start said this is what the plan is going to be, but a total lack of communication and a lack of regard for my own personal financial well being or anything like that, they've just ploughed on, on this road that they've set off down, with total disregard for local people," he said.The National Trust is among our best loved, best supported charities. The uncomfortable message from some of its tenants is that it is better at conserving buildings and landscapes than looking after the people who rely on it for their homes.</body>

      <title>Greenpeace ship Britons denied bail</title>
      <description>Two of the six Britons held on piracy charges in Russia after a Greenpeace protest at an offshore drilling platform in the Arctic have been denied bail.</description>

      <body>Two Britons arrested after a Greenpeace protest at an offshore oil drilling rig have been denied bail in Russia.A court in Murmansk ruled that Kieron Bryan, from London, and Philip Ball, of Oxfordshire, should remain in pre-trial detention until 24 November.The pair were among six Britons on board the organisation's boat Arctic Sunrise held on 18 September.Greenpeace has called from the release of Mr Bryan on the basis he was a journalist working alongside activists.All 30 people on the vessel have been accused of piracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.Four earlier bail applications from Russians - including another journalist - were also refused.Freelance video journalist Mr Bryan, 29, appeared in court behind a glass screen, wearing a green checked shirt.Russia's Interfax news agency quoted him as saying he did not have journalistic accreditation and intended to sell his footage after returning from the Arctic."I had just verbal contracts. Verbal agreements with many leading TV companies that I would provide them with footage afterwards," Bryan told the court.Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said the court's decision "flies in the face of all reason".He added: "The decision of the court to refuse bail looks increasingly like the Russian authorities are meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment even before any trial."In the case of Kieron Bryan, he is a professional journalist, travelling on the Greenpeace ship, witnessing a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean."He has committed no crime and should be released immediately."The BBC's Moscow Correspondent Daniel Sandford reports that lawyers for the two men argued that the Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya oil platform is more like an island than a ship, so piracy charges should not apply.Sergey Golubuk, a lawyer for Greenpeace International, said the detainees were denying the charge of piracy - defined by international law as "violent attack with personal gain in mind" at sea.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "All these basic indefensible elements of piracy are obviously lacking in all people on board Arctic Sunrise, without exception."Mr Bryan's brother said his family had not been able to speak to him since his arrest and were finding the situation difficult.The 32-year-old, originally from Shebbear in north Devon, has only been able to contact his family through a single letter, written nearly two weeks ago.Russell Bryan told Today: "Mum and Dad are finding it very hard, and myself as well. We haven't heard from Kieron in almost three weeks now, in terms of phone calls."It's been very hard not being able to speak to him."Kieron is a freelance journalist. He is not a Greenpeace member or a Greenpeace activist. This is not something that Kieron would have anticipated at all."A spokesman for Vladimir Putin denied the Russian President had put pressure on the investigation by declaring on 25 September that the protesters had violated international law.Russia's Investigative Committee has said the charges against some of those detained might change because drugs - thought to be poppy straw and morphine - were found on the boat.Poppy straw, or raw opium, can be used to produce morphine or heroin.The committee also said investigators were trying to establish which detainees were responsible for "deliberately ramming" Russian coastguard boats in the Arctic.Greenpeace said any suggestion illegal drugs were found was a "smear" and "fabrication" as its ships only carry medical supplies required under maritime law.The UK government, meanwhile, has raised the case of the six detained Britons with the Russian authorities.Those being held with activist Mr Ball and Mr Bryan are logistics co-ordinator Frank Hewetson from London, activist Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales, communications officer Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon and 2nd engineer Iain Rogers, from Exeter.</body>

      <body>Cyclists say they have been left confused over a "useless" new 10m-long cycle lane which tells them to go the wrong way down a one-way street.The markings, in King's Head Yard in Winchester, were painted by the city council on Wednesday.Christopher Peck from cycling charity CTC said it was a contraflow lane to "open up a maze of pedestrianised and one-way streets".But cyclist Andrew Smith called it "bizarre and pointless".The new road markings show cyclists are permitted to enter the one-way street from the opposite direction.An "except cyclists" sign has since been added below the no-entry sign for clarity, the council said.Sue Cole, Winchester CTC campaigner, said: "This is the first contraflow cycle lane in Winchester without infrastructure separating it from the carriageway."Because of the Saxon street pattern in Winchester, there is not space on most of these one-way streets to provide a dedicated contraflow cycle lane."Mr Smith said: "It just seems a complete and utter useless piece of white line painting."I wholeheartedly support the council's efforts to improve cycling safety in Winchester... but this just seems like bureaucratic nonsense - probably quota filling for cycle paths in the city centre."The city council has set up the Winchester District Cycling Strategy to "ensure cyclists can use a direct, attractive and safe network of roads".It is paid for by the local sustainable transport fund, which came from the Department for Transport after a successful bid of £4.1m by Hampshire County Council.Contraflow lanes have previously been introduced in London and Brighton.</body>

      <body>A blind golfer has a hit a hole-in-one during a tournament.Jim O'Brien, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, achieved the feat on the sixth hole at the Peter Alliss Eye2Eye Challenge at Surrey's Hindhead Golf Club on Wednesday.The 71-year-old, who is fully blind and has been playing for 16 years, said, to his knowledge, he was only the third blind golfer to land such a shot.Chris Donovan, the club's secretary, said it was an "amazing achievement".Mr O'Brien said: "It's every golfer's dream, to do a hole-in-one especially if you're totally blind."When I teed off, I hit the ball nicely. The only thought I had in my head was, 'Let's hope it makes the green'."After a few seconds, the guys I was with said 'It's in the hole'. It was a great feeling - it's unbelievable."The England and Wales Blind Golf Association has been holding the one-day tournament at the club for a number of years.The blind players are helped by a sighted caddie or guide, who lines them up for shots.Mr O'Brien, who has been unable to see since he was a child, was helped by his guide John Grindal.Mr Donovan said the odds of a fully-sighted golfer hitting a hole-in-one were between 12,000 and 14,000-to-one."It's an amazing achievement for any amateur golfer, even more so for a blind player," he said.Neil Baxter, chairman of the England and Wales Blind Golf Association, said that he knew of three totally blind members of the association who had hit holes-in-one, although others had also done it."There was a chap in Birmingham who got one earlier this year but we're not sure whether he was totally blind," he said."It's very, very rare and Jim is totally blind. We're all delighted about it."</body>

      <body>Roy Hodgson believes his England side "will deliver" World Cup qualification.They face Montenegro on Friday knowing that a win, coupled with victory over Poland on Tuesday, would guarantee their place in Brazil next year.England have 16 points, one more than Ukraine and Montenegro, who are second and third respectively in Group H."We realise England expects," Hodgson said. "They expect us to play well in these two games and to win them. I believe the players will deliver."Hodgson, who succeeded Fabio Capello before Euro 2012 , added: "It is a big responsibility when you take on the role of manager of an England team."We are England. We are one of the big nations and we are expected to qualify for World Cups and European Championships."You know that when you take on the job and you know that if that doesn't happen there will be a lot of criticism. If you're wise you will realise there will be a lot of criticism during the time you are qualifying."The 66-year-old, who led Switzerland to the 1994 World Cup finals, said his team would "not look for excuses" if they failed to qualify for a World Cup for the first time in 20 years.He added: "I don't think we've made excuses anyway. I would be saddened to think my time as national coach has been riddled with excuses. We've taken responsibility all along. We're not looking for excuses."We're looking to play the game. We're ready for it. We believe in ourselves, trust in each other, have the right determination and motivation."Former England captain Alan Shearer believes that England do not deserve a spot in next year's tournament if they cannot defeat both Montenegro and Poland."I'm hopeful but I'm not confident because I've not seen enough in the qualifiers that we've played to suggest that I can tell you how confident I am," the 43-year-old, who scored 30 international goals, told BBC Radio 5 live."We haven't played well in a number of games and got the right results. If we can't beat Montenegro at home and Poland at home then England don't deserve to qualify."Former midfielder Chris Waddle, who was in the England squads for World Cup 1986 and 1990 and the 1988 European Championship, said Hodgson's men must win both games."Montenegro are a team we don't seem to beat," Waddle told BBC Sport."I think Ukraine will win their last two games. If we draw [against Montenegro] then we could come a cropper. Are we guaranteed to beat those two teams? No."</body>

      <title>I was offered £20K to fix - O'Sullivan</title>
      <description>World snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will be asked to explain claims he rejected a £20,000 offer to fix a match.</description>

      <body>World champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will be asked to explain claims he rejected a £20,000 offer to fix a Premier League snooker match about 10 years ago."Someone rang me and said he'd like to meet me over in the forest and have a walk through the woods," O'Sullivan, 37, wrote in his new autobiography."What they were offering, 20 grand," he added, "I could get for a couple of nights' work."Snooker's governing body said he would be asked to clarify his claims."We are aware of what has been said in his book and we will be writing to Ronnie O'Sullivan to ask him to explain his comments," said Nigel Mawer, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's disciplinary committee.O'Sullivan, who won his fifth world title in May after taking a six-month break from the sport, said the meeting - in Epping Forest, Essex - lasted about 15 minutes."If anyone could get away with it, I could. I could just play one-handed or left-handed, or just put a towel over my head, and pretend I was going nuts," he said."But it's not something I would or could do. I couldn't live with myself; I'd feel that was robbing somebody."The revelation comes less than a month after former world top-five player Stephen Lee was handed a 12-year ban after being found guilty of seven match-fixing charges. He is appealing against the verdict.In an interview with BBC Sport, O'Sullivan was asked whether he had ever considered throwing a match."I can't do it. I enjoy playing - snooker's given me a great life," he said."You put all of that on the line. Without snooker you'd lose friends and family."You're not just taking the money, but jeopardising relationships with people, the sport, and the opportunity to embrace great things that being a professional snooker player can give you."O'Sullivan recently backtracked on a claim he made that Lee was not the only player guilty of match-fixing.The Essex player, nicknamed 'The Rocket', had originally tweeted: "I've heard there's many more players who throw snooker matches."I suppose Steve Lee was just caught out."No need to worry if you got nothing to hide. But plenty of people have got loads to hide. That's why there is no free speech. They're hiding."World Snooker boss Barry Hearn reacted by stating O'Sullivan's comments were "unacceptable and damaging".O'Sullivan later said he had "no concrete evidence of match-fixing in snooker", but hinted players were aware of who might be involved.</body>

      <title>Chase discovers English roots</title>
      <description>England's New Zealand-born half-back Rangi Chase finds English heritage which he hopes will silence his critics.</description>

      <date>1381498588</date>
      <body>England's New Zealand-born Rangi Chase says he has found some English heritage which he hopes will end the debate over his controversial selection.The 2011 Man of Steel caused a stir when he switched allegiance two years ago on residency grounds.In the previous 12 months he played against England both for New Zealand Maori and the Exiles."One of my aunties has given me my family tree and it actually comes from England," said the half-back, 27."So, in a way, I've got that English blood in me. It might only be a little bit but it's in there and it's a big honour."The former Castleford stand-off, who has signed for Salford, is currently training with Steve McNamara's squad in South Africa, ahead of the World Cup, hosted by England and Wales, which starts on Saturday, 26 October.Although Chase hopes his discovery will finally win over the sceptics, he accepts he may never be able to please everyone."I've got my own personal reasons why I play for England," he added, following a week where Arsenal's Jack Wilshere launched a debate about sporting nationality by saying only English players should play for the England football team."Even before then, it was a big honour but it makes it a bit more special to know that I'm linked, I'm tied, I've got a bit of English blood in me. It means a lot to me. I'm passionate about where I come from and my ancestors."There is always going to be doubt and people are entitled to their own opinions but it makes it extra special because the name Chase is an English name."I believe everything happens for a reason. I believe I should be here and I'm grateful for that."</body>

      <title>A list for living, not a bucket list</title>
      <description>BBC journalist Helen Fawkes considers the "bucket list"</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477163</url>
      <date>1381454569</date>
      <body>Many people now make bucket lists. The BBC's Helen Fawkes explores the experiences people want before they die, and her own "list for living".What would you do if you found out that your time was limited? If you were told that you could be dead within months, you certainly had no more than five years to live?Well, that's the situation which I'm facing. On Christmas Eve last year I found out that I had incurable ovarian cancer. I felt waves of shock, sadness and anger. But I also knew that once I'd come to terms with the devastating news, I was going to make the most of the time I had left.A few days before the diagnosis, as I waited for one of many medical appointments, I thought about the things I might never do. I started to write down some of the stuff in my reporter's notebook. This was the start of my bucket list.Getting a dog, exploring the ancient ruins in Rome, taking a speed boat down the Thames, having my book published, learning to play poker and seeing penguins in the South Pole are just some of the 50 things I want to do.This has become known as a bucket list because it's all the things you want to achieve before you kick the bucket. But I don't like the term. I'd rather focus on the living, not the dying. I prefer to call it my "list for living".This cancer business is so horrific that it can easily take over your identity. Having this gives you something else to focus on and makes you feel like you again. So far I've managed to do 10 of them. I've pulled a pint in my local pub, I went to Paris with a group of friends just for lunch, modelled in a fashion show and zoomed down a zip wire. Next weekend I will present a Radio 4 programme, Pick of the Week, which will mean another big tick.But what's most important to me is right at the top of the list - move to the countryside and live in my own house. This is also what I wrote down in my notepad while I waited at hospital back in the winter. A couple of months ago I finally got my own home in a village. It needs lots of work to coax it out of the 1980s but once its done I'll be able to live there. It's an incredible feeling doing something I've wanted for years.I'm not sure I'll ever get to do everything on my bucket list but Susan Spencer-Wendel, from Florida, is someone who has. Susan is terminally ill with ALS, or motor neurone disease, an incurable condition which destroys the nerves that power her muscles.Susan realised that she had around a year left of relatively good health so she went on all the trips she wanted to with her loved ones. This included going to see the Northern Lights with her best friend and wedding dress shopping in New York with her teenage daughter - something she knew she'd never get to do for real.Susan wrote about her story in Until I say Goodbye: My Year of Living with Joy - A book she tapped out on an iPhone using just one thumb. She told me that her joy came from getting the best possible outcome from the worst of circumstances."I discovered the depth of love I have for the people around me and the depth of love they have for me. I discovered friends I never knew I had. And this lifts me each and every hour."Just like Susan, my list for living is about taking back some control. When you're told that you could die soon, many of your future plans are shattered. Life revolves around tests, treatments and trying desperately to feel well.My bucket list has given me some kind of a structure. There are no excuses anymore. You have to get on and do things rather than thinking you must do it someday. It's almost like giving pleasure a priority, in doing so you create powerful memories. I have one friend who must have spent hundreds of hours at hospital with me so it was really special to be able to do something totally unconnected with cancer and go glass-blowing.My list for living has made me realise that when I'm taking part in something I enjoy I feel so much better. It gives me a real boost. In May, I went to see Stonehenge at sunrise with a friend. As soon as I stood inside the ancient stone circle it was like my chemo fog lifted.For a magical hour, just the two of us watched night turn into day. As we left, the spell was broken. Not long afterwards I felt so chronically ill that I was barely able to walk.This was near to the end of some very toxic treatment. What helped to get me through it all was my plan to recover afterwards on a ridiculously perfect beach. It was so chilly and wet at times that I needed my coat but I had a blissful time in Cornwall. It was number five on my list so this shows you how badly I wanted the holiday. It's so vital to have something to look forward to. I may be fighting a killer disease but I still need some hope in my life.I used to be very sporty and I still crave that adrenalin rush so I picked a few things like sky diving and swimming with sharks just because they would terrify me. I haven't yet been brave enough to do those. But I have been driven very fast around a racetrack. A friend arranged for the ex-Formula 1 star David Coulthard to drive me around Silverstone. The speed was so exhilarating that I couldn't even scream to start with. It's funny how being scared to death can make you feel so alive.One of the reasons I responded to my diagnosis with a bucket list was because of a book I'd recently read, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. Bronnie Ware looked after terminally ill people in Australia. She realised that many of them shared the same concerns. For example, they wished they hadn't worked so hard and they'd allowed themselves to be happy.When I interviewed Bronnie for my documentary she told me that one of her favourite clients was a woman called Grace. She always wanted to travel but didn't because of her husband."She was a lady who spent her life in a very unhappy, dominating marriage. Her husband went into a nursing home because he was ill. She then became terminally ill within a few weeks of gaining the freedom that she had waited 50 or 60 years for. So she actually never got to live any of those dreams and she insisted on me promising her that I would live a life true to myself," Bronnie explained.I'm glad that I don't have any big regrets. This is partly down to another bucket list that I made. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with cancer for the very first time. While I was ill from the evil chemo cocktails I couldn't do anything but think about what I wanted to do once I was well again. I came up with a list of 10 things. Within weeks of finishing treatment I was in Moscow, pursuing my dream of becoming a BBC foreign correspondent.I'm clearly a fan of bucket lists but I understand that they're not for everyone. I wonder whether they create too much pressure to try to cram in everything? Psychotherapist Philippa Perry is worried that some people may have one for the wrong reasons."My first reaction is to think of it in terms of a shopping list. It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It's not about being alive, it's about going through the motions."My aim is not just to have things to tick off but to be left with a whole load of special memories with the people who mean the most to me. I know that when I'm dying and I'm too sick to do anything else they will be at my bedside reminding me about our adventures.Like the time we went to Paris. How we ended up at a beautiful cocktail bar in the middle of the afternoon after a long lunch. Another customer remarked that we sounded like we were having a lot of fun and asked me what we were celebrating. After an embarrassing moment, I told her we were celebrating life.Helen's list for living: 1) Live in my own house (almost done), 2) Move to the country (almost done), 3) Get a dog, 4) Play a netball game, again, 5) Recover from chemo on a ridiculously perfect beach (done), 6) See penguins in the South Pole, 7) Go to Paris by Eurostar just for lunch (done), 8) Visit Pompeii and drive along the Amalfi coast, 9) Explore the ancient ruins in Rome, 10) Snorkel on a coral reef, 11) Trek in Nepal, 12) Go to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, 13) See the Northern Lights, 14) Ride a camel across a desert, 15) Drink a mojito in Cuba, 16) See Stonehenge at sunrise (Done), 17) Go into space, 18) Get married, 19) Get my book published, 20) Present a BBC Radio 4 programme, 21) Hold an exhibition of my cow photographs, 22) Do voluntary work, 23) Run a 5K, 24) Skydive, 25) Go gliding, 26) Ride a horse through Hyde Park, 27) Try kite surfing, 28) Zoom down a zip wire (done), 29) Surf somewhere hot, 30) Go coasteering somewhere cold, 31) Take a speed boat down the Thames, 32) Swing on a trapeze, 33) Fly in a hot air balloon, 34) Take a private jet over London, 35) Fly in a stealth airplane, 36) Be driven very fast around a race track in a sports car (done), 37) Sleep under the stars, 38) Get a tattoo, 39) Have a henna crown painted on my baldy head once the hair falls out, 40) Grow my hair long, again, 41) Be a model and work the catwalk (done), 42) Learn to play poker, 43) Pull a pint in a proper pub (done), 44) Hold a party in a castle, 45) Go glass-blowing (done), 46) See puffins in UK, 47) Swim with sharks, 48) Sail alongside a pod of dolphins at sea, 49) Catch fireflies in a jar, 50) Drink champagne in one of the best bars in the world just before Christmas to celebrate still being alive.Helen Fawkes shares her list for living on BBC World Service at 08:06 GMT (09:06 BST on) on Monday 14 OctoberFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Disabled access stuck on red light?</title>
      <description>Disabled rail at poor station access</description>

      <date>1381461337</date>
      <body>More than 1,000 of the UK's 2,500 railway stations need "urgent" upgrades to help disabled people, the government has said. But while efforts to improve the situation are being made, some disabled passengers in the West Midlands fear their problems could continue for years.One commuter who faces the problems on a daily basis is 30-year-old David Lewis. A wheelchair user due to chronic arthritis, Mr Lewis travels the country giving talks on his condition.However, he cannot use his local train station in Acocks Green in Birmingham as it has no disability access at all."I have regular appointments at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham," he said."To get there by train should be free, due to my rail pass."But because I cannot access my nearest station, Acocks Green, at all, I have to pay about £15 per trip in a black cab."He added: "Some stations are not even manned in the evening; and lifts are closed down in the evening too, so even if you can get there, there is nobody to assist you."If I am travelling by train now, it takes days of preparation. I have to use the internet to find stations that allow access to disabled people and plot a route that way."The situation in London is a lot easier, but here in the Midlands, it is not so good. Not enough is being done."Efforts to remedy the situation are ongoing, the government says. The DfT's Access for All fund is a pot of £100m to cover access improvements to more than 150 stations in England, Wales and Scotland between 2014 and 2019.However, it has said it cannot guarantee when the improvements will be delivered to hundreds of stations nationwide that are not yet on this list.In the West Midlands, Birmingham's New Street Station welcomes 31 million commuters through its doors each year. All platforms have lifts and escalators, all entrances have automatic doors and wheelchairs can be provided if needed.Yet within a few miles of New Street, 14 of the 69 West Midlands region's stations are in need of disabled access upgrades but with no indication of when they will get them.For many, the timetable for improvements is not good enough. Residents in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, complain their local station is not listed for improvements via the fund.Their MP, Joan Walley, says she plans to raise the matter in Parliament."I have become increasingly frustrated at the lack of disabled access," she said. "The current situation is unacceptable."Just a few miles down the track, Stoke-on-Trent's station has full disabled access but eight of the 22 stations in Staffordshire are without similar facilities - and currently have no timetable for improvements.Others stations around the region, like their counterparts around the country, have ramp access to one or two platforms, but only stair access to others; drastically limiting the travel opportunities of wheelchair users.A spokesman for the DfT said: "The Access for All programme is currently delivering step-free access at over 150 stations. Other access improvements, such as hand rails, will be delivered to over 1,000 stations due to the programme."While we cannot guarantee which stations will be included, a further £100m will extend the programme from 2015 to 2019."Stations across the country included in the extended programme are due to be named in early 2014. Until then, the daily struggle for thousands of disabled commuters continues.</body>

      <description>Owners mourn the end of the "infinitely recyclable" Defender</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24458499</url>
      <date>1381392805</date>
      <body>It's the vehicle that can be patched up "with string" and carry you through deep waters, across Europe and into the Sahara Desert - at least, according to its owners.So there was heartache in the hills and despairing in the dales as Jaguar Land Rover announced it will cease production of its Defender model in 2015 because it will not meet new European laws on fuel emissions.The last Land Rover Defender will roll off the production line in Solihull in December 2015, bringing to an end a 67-year history of different versions of the model."It's a mistake," said Land Rover Defender owner Viv Wing, from Grantham in Lincolnshire. "What are they going to make instead? Something with nice seats and too much carpet, probably."While the luxuries of sleek, modern makes may be what many motor enthusiasts aspire to, it is the all-weather hardiness of the Defender that is part of the charm for its devoted worldwide following."It's a brilliant bit of kit," said Mrs Wing, the secretary of the Leicestershire and Rutland Land Rover Club. "Some people would prefer a Ferrari, but each to his own."For Mrs Wing, who has mobility issues following a riding accident, the Defender is a lifeline, taking her out into terrain she otherwise would not be able to access."I love the countryside and the Defender enables me to get out and see the views," she said. "We went up Stanage Edge in the Peak District in ours the other week."In October 2012, Mrs Wing and her husband Mick joined up with 10 other owners on a 3,000-mile round trip through Europe to the Sahara Desert."One guy's engine flooded, so he stood and fixed it by the side of the road in the desert," she said. "You can do that with a Land Rover."The ease of repair - at least for the pre-1998 models which were constructed with minimal electronics - is another appeal for owners."They're like a big Meccano set really," said Richard Smith, 48, from Redditch, chairman of the Midland Rover Owners Club - the oldest in the country. "They are infinitely recyclable."He uses his six Land Rovers - the oldest, a Series 2, dating from 1959, to take part in trialling and rallies."I've heard of people driving them round patched up with gaffer tape. I knew a guy who drove back from Wales with a piece of string tied round his throttle cable when his throttle broke."The Defender is probably best known for its all-weather roadworthiness. While some cars shrink from extreme conditions, the Defender was built to tackle them head-on.Mr Smith said his members work with NHS on-call medical staff during floods and snowfall to transport nurses to critically ill patients."It's quite fulfilling to be able to help them do that," he said. "Not many people know we are involved in that work."Often the love of Land Rovers is passed down the generations. Simone Birch, from Leicester, claims the vehicles are "in her blood".Both Mrs Birch's two grown-up sons own Land Rovers and her three-year-old grandson can now name all the different models."They have a cult following," she said. "When you pass another one on the road, the driver waves at you."So what will the demise of the Defender mean for devotees?"We'll still be able to get the parts - there are plenty of third-party suppliers," said John Kesterton, from Solihull, secretary of the Midland branch."And while we don't know what the replacement vehicle is going to be, hopefully it will maintain the Defender's off-road capabilities."So does he plan to trade in his 1998 Defender CSW, with 175,000 miles on the clock?"Not any time soon," he said.</body>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <title>Premier League one third English</title>
      <description>Premier League now "less than one third English", study finds</description>

      <date>1381399460</date>
      <body>English footballers account for less than a third of all the minutes played in the Premier League, a State of the Game study for BBC Sport has found.The figure for home country players - 32.26% - is down from 35.43% in 2007-08 and is significantly lower than all other major European leagues according to football statisticians Opta.In La Liga, home of World Cup holders and European champions Spain, Spaniards account for 59% of all minutes played. In Germany's Bundesliga, Germans make up 50%.The minutes played by Scottish players in the Scottish Premiership has remained static - 57.36% in 2007-08 and 57.19% so far this season.But Scottish (3.27%), Welsh (3.17%) and Northern Irish (0.93%) players have got fewer minutes on the pitch in the Premier League than French (8.1%), Dutch (4%) and Spanish (6.27%) players so far this season.However, footballers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are playing more minutes in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership than they did five years ago.In total, 60.36% of minutes in the Premier League have been completed by foreign players so far this season, up from 56.7% in 2007-08.Former England captain Alan Shearer said: "These are tough times for English football at the moment. Everyone is aware that English football is not as healthy as it should be and I'm afraid it is all going to take time."Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the figures were a "concern", but added: "There are only two ways you can see it - you have the opportunity to have the best players in the world in England, so let's see what they have and let's produce players who have the same qualities."Or you say, let's protect our players, keep the good players out and let's just play the English players. I believe that we live in a global world. The real question for English football is whether it can produce the players with the needed quality."In a statement, the Premier League said that it was working to encourage the development of home-grown talent, and highlighted the efforts being made as part of the Elite Player Performance Plan, a scheme designed to increase levels of investment and raise the standards of youth set-ups at English professional clubs."The Premier League is one season into the implementation of its £340m Elite Player Performance Plan, the number one stated aim of which is to develop more and better home-grown players," a spokesman said."Significant progress has already been made with club academies independently audited, coaching hours and provision increased, and new competitions established."Young home-grown players, including Daniel Sturridge [at Liverpool], Danny Welbeck [at Manchester United], Ross Barkley [at Everton], Ravel Morrison [at West Ham] and several others, have already made a significant impact this season. The clubs are working harder than ever to develop more home-grown players of sufficient quality to play in the Premier League."The BBC's study examined the minutes played by every nationality represented in the Premier League, the Championship and the Scottish Premiership so far this season, compared with the 2007-08 campaign, the last time all the home nations failed to qualify for a major tournament.The findings come ahead of a crucial few days in England's campaign to reach for next summer's World Cup in Brazil, a tournament that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to qualify for.State of the Game found:Only last month, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke addressed what he called a "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players playing regularly in the Premier League.Against the backdrop of a growing foreign influence in the Premier League, Dyke warned England might not be able to compete seriously on the world stage without changes in the domestic game.Shearer, who won 63 caps between 1992 and 2000 said: "It makes it harder for England, there's no doubt about it."But England didn't qualify for the US in 1994 when the percentage of British players was quite high, so I do believe that it's not only the number of foreign players in the Premier League that is making things difficult for England."I believe there are a number of other things. Foreign players are a lot cheaper than British players and as we all know, managers have no time whatsoever."There is also the hunger of young players and the coaching that players have. If you put all that together, then that's where England are at this moment in time."Chris Waddle, who won 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, said: "The Premier League is a great product to sell around the world but for the national team it does a lot of damage."All this money flying around in the Premier League, and grassroots [football] is going backwards."Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was an "acute problem and getting worse"."Unless there is some sort of ratio idea that Uefa president Michel Platini has been advocating over the years, I expect that we are not going to resolve that problem," he added.Former Northern Ireland international Billy Hamilton, who starred at the 1982 World Cup, said the figures painted a "bleak future" for his country."Unless the Premier League or indeed Championship put some kind of cap on the amount of foreign players then the statistics are only going to get worse for Northern Ireland," he said."Well, if the Premier League don't introduce a cap on foreign players to four or five in a team, I can tell you that England will never win another tournament."David Wetherall, head of player development at the Football League, said he was not surprised the numbers of UK numbers were on the up in the Championship."There's some fantastic youth development work being done in the Football League. About £60m per year is invested in youth development in the Football League, and two thirds of that comes from the clubs themselves."Figures amended at 13:12 BST on 10 Oct because of Serbia being counted twice</body>

      <body>Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.He added: "She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'"The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.He added: "I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages."The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.The existence of the so-called "God particle", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: "How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming."An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.Prof Higgs added: "In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime."But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there".Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: "I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern."I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels."Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive."But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists."Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960."Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: "It's very nice to be right sometimes."</body>

      <title>Dead star eats water-rich asteroid</title>
      <description>Astronomers detect the tell-tale signs of a shattered asteroid being eaten by a dead star, or white dwarf.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have detected the tell-tale signs of a shattered asteroid being eaten by a dead star, or white dwarf.The Hubble telescope spotted the event some 150 light-years from Earth.The researchers tell Science Magazine that the chemical signatures in the star's atmosphere indicate the asteroid must contain a lot of water.This makes it the first time both water and a rocky surface - key components for habitable planets - have been found together beyond our Solar System.The dead star is called GD 61. It has long since burnt through its nuclear fuel and has shrunk down to a dimly glowing ember.But its gravity is still intense, and it is shredding rocky objects in its vicinity and pulling the debris into its outermost layers.Hubble and the Hawaiian Keck observatory record how this inflow of material taints the star's atmosphere.They detect elements such as magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen - the chemical ingredients of rock minerals.But what piques the scientists' interest is the abundance of oxygen.This is far too high to be explained just from the in-fall of rock, and indicates that whatever is being dragged on to the dwarf must also contain a lot of water.The team's calculations point to the source body being an asteroid at least 90km across and composed of perhaps 26% by mass of water.This is very similar to Ceres, the largest asteroid in the main belt of our Solar System and the target of a Nasa probe next year.By way of comparison, the Earth is a very dry object, containing just 0.02% by mass of water, and much of this was probably delivered by comets and asteroids.The astronomers - from the universities of Cambridge and Warwick, UK, and from Kiel, Germany - speculate that a similar water-delivery system could also have occurred in the GD 61 system, which is very likely to have had rocky planets in its heyday.Lead author Dr Jay Farihi told the BBC's Science In Action programme: "The reason that we can say that is that the planet-formation process starts with things as small as dust grains. They grow into things as big as pebbles and boulders and then as large as asteroids. Once you get to things as big as asteroids, planets are essentially inevitable - it's a runaway process; you simply cannot stop it."Having asteroids and no planets is logically possible but it's very likely physically implausible. So, we know there were rocky planets [in GD 61] because we can see the rocky building blocks; and we know there was the potential to deliver water to their surfaces because we've seen at least one very water-rich and large asteroid."Of the 1,000 planets so far identified beyond our Solar System, none has been definitively associated with the presence of water.For most of these objects, all that is known is a few details such as distance, size, density and the time taken to orbit the host star. The Hubble-Keck observations therefore represent the first time water has definitively been put in immediate contact with a far-off rocky surface, says Dr Farihi.The GD 61 system also gives us a glimpse of what is likely to occur one day in the vicinity of our own star - the Sun. Billions of years into the future, it too will burn out and shrink into a white dwarf, consuming asteroids and other debris."I think alien astronomers would then be getting pretty similar information to what we're getting on GD 61," Dr Farihi, from the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy, explained."I guess it would depend on what time they looked and which asteroid they were lucky enough to catch. But we know of water-rich asteroids in the outer main belt and I think there would be a good chance that they would see a signature of something like the asteroid Ceres. And in that case, if the alien astronomers speculated about habitable planets - well, if they're looking back at our system, in that case they'd be correct."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction.A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction.The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal."When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge."That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed."This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups."In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed,"Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group."If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said."In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival."What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]."Damp nipplesThe idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats.Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples."Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained.The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper.The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time."Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed.She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters.But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour."The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do."More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on."They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day."Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression."Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young."Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten."So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group."</body>

      <title>Syria monitors win Nobel Peace Prize</title>
      <description>The OPCW, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, wins the Nobel Peace Prize.</description>

      <body>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal, has won the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee said it was in honour of the OPCW's "extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons".The OPCW, based in The Hague, was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said the award was a "great honour" and would spur it on in its work.He said the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria had been a "tragic reminder that there remains much work to be done".The OPCW recently sent inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons.It is the first time OPCW inspectors have worked in an active war zone.The watchdog picks up a gold medal and 8m Swedish kronor ($1.25m; £780,000) as winner of the most coveted of the Nobel honours.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the award, saying the OPCW had "greatly strengthened the rule of law in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation".Announcing the award in Oslo, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said it wanted to recognise the OPCW's "extensive work"."The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law," he said."Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons."The OPCW's Ahmet Uzumcu said the organisation had been working "with quiet determination to rid the world of these heinous weapons", away from the spotlight, for the past 16 years.He said the Syria mission was the first time the OPCW had worked to such a short timeframe and in an ongoing conflict, and that it was "conscious of the enormous trust" placed on it by the international community.Praising the commitment of his staff and the support of member states, he said the Nobel Peace Prize would "spur us to untiring effort, even stronger commitment and greater dedication" to bring about a world free of chemical weapons".The head of the OPCW inspection team in Syria, Ake Sellstrom, said: "This is a powerful pat on the back that will strengthen the organisation's work in Syria."The OPCW is made up of 189 member states and the principal role of its 500-strong staff is to monitor and destroy all existing chemical weapons.It draws on a network of some of the best laboratories and scientists in the world to help it in its work, the BBC's science correspondent Pallab Ghosh says.The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention has contributed to the destruction of nearly 80% of the world's chemical weapons stockpile.Syria is expected to sign the treaty in the coming days.French President Francois Hollande said the Nobel prize was a "vindication" of the international efforts in Syria and pledged continued support for the OPCW's work there and elsewhere.US Secretary of State John Kerry said the "Nobel Committee has rightly recognised [the OPCW's] bravery and resolve".European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso, EU President Herman Van Rompuy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel all congratulated the OPCW.There were a record 259 nominees for this year's Peace Prize, but the list remains a secret.Pakistani schoolgirl campaigner Malala Yousafzai and gynaecologist Denis Mukwege of the Democratic Republic of Congo had been tipped as favourites to take the award.Others who had been listed as contenders were Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), the US soldier convicted of giving classified documents to Wikileaks and Maggie Gobran, an Egyptian computer scientist who abandoned her academic career to become a Coptic Christian nun and founded the charity Stephen's Children.But an hour before Friday's announcement, NRK reported the award would go to the OPCW.The European Union won the prize in 2012 in recognition of its contribution to peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.Previous Nobel Peace Prize laureates include anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, US President Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Nobel Committee has in the past publicly regretted never awarding the prize to Mahatma Gandhi, the pacifist leader of the Indian nationalist movement against British rule, even though he was nominated five times.</body>

      <title>New data on badger TB spread</title>
      <description>Cattle to cattle transmission of bovine TB accounts for 94% of cases, new data suggests.</description>

      <body>Herd-to-herd transmission of bovine TB in cattle accounts for 94% of cases, according to new data.Further analysis of scientific evidence from the Krebs badger culling trial found around 6% of infected cattle catch TB directly from badgers.The figure rises to about 50%, when cattle infected by badgers pass it on to other herds, say Imperial College London scientists.The government is to decide shortly whether to extend pilot culls.A six-week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended, but the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.A similar trial in Gloucestershire is still ongoing. An application has been made to extend the trial, but it is not known how many badgers have been shot.The role of badgers in spreading bovine TB has been hotly debated as part of discussions about whether badgers in England should be culled to control the spread of the disease.The scientific evidence for and against badger culling comes from the £50m Randomised Badger Culling (Krebs) trial.The study, which ran from 1998 to 2005, found evidence that culling could reduce TB in herds inside culled areas, while increasing TB in areas nearby.Mathematical modelling revealed that in high TB areas badgers accounted for roughly 50% of cases in cattle.A new more detailed analysis published in the journal PLOS Currents Outbreaks found that of this 50%, 6% was because of primary transmission from badgers to cattle, with the remainder coming from cattle that had been infected by badgers passing the disease on to other herds.Research leader Prof Christl Donnelly told the BBC: "The results show that both badgers and cattle are important in this transmission system - that we're getting introductions from badgers and they're being amplified spreading from herd to herd."The 6% figure tells you about introductions into herds and that tells you that 6% of the introductions into herds come from badgers; 94% of them come from other cattle herds."She said the estimates came from early in the Krebs trial and further control measures had been introduced since then to reduce cattle to cattle transmission.Prof Donnelly added: "These findings confirm that badgers do play a large role in the spread of bovine TB. These figures should inform the debate, even if they don't point to a single way forward."Ministers and the NFU say badger culling is needed to control TB in cattle.Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal rights groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease.</body>

      <title>GM yeast brews fuel from rubbish</title>
      <description>Food science researchers from the USA have developed a GM yeast that turns rubbish into fuel.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24489800</url>
      <date>1381487530</date>
      <body>US researchers have used genetically modified yeast to enhance the production of biofuels from waste materials.The new method solves some of the problems in using waste like straw to make bioethanol fuel.The scientists involved say the development could help overcome reservations about using land for fuel production.The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.Many states around the world have plans to replace gasoline with bioethanol, but this has typically been by changing land-use from food crops to biofuel.Just this week, a representative of South Africa's farming community announced that sorghum harvests would need to increase five fold to meet their government's commitment to incorporate at least 2% bioethanol in petrol.Sorghum is South Africa's second biggest summer crop and is a staple food as well as being used in brewing and livestock feed.However, scientists are now seeking more sustainable routes to generating biofuel - routes that would have a lighter impact on food prices and production.One is to consider using non-conventional plants such as seaweed. But among the most radical ideas is the suggestion that biowastes should be used to produce bioethanol, which is added to petrol replacing some fossil fuel."Wastes present a major opportunity in this respect. We have to start to think about wastes, such as sewage or landfill waste as resources - not problems to be disposed of," Dr Gavin Collins, an environmental microbiologist at the National University of Ireland, Galway, told BBC News.Using microbes to make fuel from biomass involves breaking down large complex biopolymer molecules.These are indigestible to most bugs, and attempts to incorporate them into fuel production have slowed down the biotechnology, creating bottlenecks.One chemical that is produced when processing biowastes is a large sugar molecule called xylose.When you try and use yeast to ferment xylose, rather than making alcohol for fuel directly, it generates acetic acid - essentially vinegar. This is poisonous to the yeast, and stops the fermentation.Breaking down xylose and making acetic acid non-toxic are the two major problems that must be solved if biowastes such as straw are to be fermented to make fuel.Now, US biotechnologists appear to have solved both problems, by developing a genetically engineered strain of yeast that simultaneously breaks down xylose and converts acetic acid to fuel."Xylose is a sugar; we can engineer yeast to ferment xylose," said University of Illinois Prof Yong-Su Jin, one of the authors of the study."However, acetic acid is a toxic compound that kills yeast. That is one of the biggest problems in cellulosic ethanol production."The yeast digests the sugars in oxygen-poor conditions, making the process more efficient than digesters that rely on active mixing of air into the system.A new pathway, not yet discovered in nature, has been genetically engineered in the lab. This breakthrough means yeasts can be used much more efficiently to convert biowaste into biofuel."We sort of rebuilt how yeast uses carbon," said principal investigator Dr Jamie Cate, of the University of California at BerkeleyOne hurdle to implementing the discovery is that the new yeast that has been developed is genetically modified, and it is not yet clear how easily GM yeasts might be accepted for use on an industrial scale.Dr Gavin Collins, however, remains upbeat about the prospects for biotechnology."We probably know the function of only about 0.01% of all living microbes on Earth," he said."It may be that many of them can efficiently degrade even complex plant material and other wastes under anaerobic conditions. They may be present in nature but we haven't found them yet."However, just look at what we have been able to do with the small fraction of microbes we understand - everything from antibiotic production; food and alcohol production; and biofuel production."Just think what we could do, or what we might discover, if we understood the function of just another 1%."</body>

      <title>European origins laid bare by DNA</title>
      <description>DNA from ancient skeletons has revealed how a complex patchwork of prehistoric migrations fashioned the modern European gene pool.</description>

      <body>DNA from ancient skeletons has revealed how a complex patchwork of prehistoric migrations fashioned the modern European gene pool.The study appears to refute the picture of Europeans as a simple mixture of indigenous hunters and Near Eastern farmers who arrived 7,000 years ago.The findings by an international team have been published in Science journal.DNA was analysed from 364 skeletons unearthed in Germany - an important crossroads for prehistoric cultures."This is the largest and most detailed genetic time series of Europe yet created, allowing us to establish a complete genetic chronology," said co-author Dr Wolfgang Haak of the Australian Centre for DNA (ACAD) in Adelaide."Focusing on this small but highly important geographic region meant we could generate a gapless record, and directly observe genetic changes in 'real-time' from 7,500 to 3,500 years ago, from the earliest farmers to the early Bronze Age."Dr Haak and his colleagues analysed DNA extracted from the teeth and bones of well-preserved remains from the Mittelelbe-Saale region of Germany. They focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) - the genetic information in the cell's "batteries".MtDNA is passed down from a mother to her children, allowing geneticists to probe the maternal histories of populations. Geneticists recognise a variety of mitochondrial DNA "clans", or lineages, in human populations. And each of these lineages has its own distinct history.The team's results show that indigenous hunter-gatherers in Central Europe were edged out by incomers from Anatolia (modern Turkey) some 7,500 years ago. A majority of the hunters belonged to the maternal clan known as haplogroup U, whilst the farmers carried a selection of genetic lineages characteristic of the Near East.Around 6,100 years ago, farming was introduced to Scandinavia, which coincided with the appearance of Neolithic mtDNA lineages in that region too."In some ways agriculture was an obvious and easy way to go in the Fertile Crescent. But once you take it out of there, it involves an abrupt shift in lifestyle," said Dr Spencer Wells, director of the Genographic Project and an Explorer-in-Residence at National Geographic, adding that early agricultural groups were living "on the edge"."They were basically taking crops that had evolved over millions of years in the Middle East and were adapted to that dry-wet pattern of seasonality and moving them into an area that was recently de-glaciated."It was no trivial thing to transfer crops such as barley and rye to the northern fringes of Europe."Dr Wells thinks this precarious existence may be reflected in the spread of the lactase persistence gene, which enables people to digest milk into adulthood. Scandinavian populations have some of the highest frequencies of this gene variant in Europe, and it appears to have undergone strong natural selection in the last few thousand years - suggesting milk had a key nutritional role and the ability to drink it conferred an enormous advantage."What it implies is that the underlying farming culture is not stable. They are literally teetering on the brink of dying out," said Dr Wells.Indeed, something does seem to have happened to the descendents of the first farmers in Central Europe. The DNA evidence shows that about a millennium later, genetic lineages associated with these Near Eastern pioneers decline, and those of the hunter-gatherers bounce back. Climate change and disease are both possibilities, but the causes are a matter for further investigation.A second study, also published in Science by Ruth Bollongino at the University of Mainz, Germany and colleagues, implies that hunter-gatherer cultures persisted alongside farming cultures for 2,000 years after the introduction of agriculture to the region - with very little interbreeding between the two.From 4,800 years ago, novel maternal lineages spread into the region, associated with the emergence of the Corded Ware people - who take their name from the inscribed patterns on their pottery.The study suggests this culture was brought by groups moving in from the East. Scientists compared the mtDNA types found in Corded Ware people with modern populations and found distinct affinities with present-day groups in Eastern Europe, the Baltic region and the Caucasus.A few hundred years later, a counterpart of this society swept in from the West. This ancient group, known as the Bell Beaker Culture, was in part responsible for the spread of a mtDNA lineage called Haplogroup H.Largely absent from Central European hunters and scarce in early Neolithic farmers, H remains the dominant maternal lineage in Europe today and comparisons between the Bell Beaker people and modern populations suggest they came from Iberia - modern Spain and Portugal."Our study shows that a simple mix of indigenous hunter-gatherers and the incoming Near Eastern farmers cannot explain the modern-day diversity alone," said co-author Guido Brandt, from the University of Mainz."The genetic results are much more complex than that. Instead, we found that two particular cultures at the brink of the Bronze Age 4,200 years ago had a marked role in the formation of Central Europe's genetic makeup."Spencer Wells explained: "When you look at today's populations, what you are seeing is a hazy palimpsest of what actually went on to create present-day patterns."Dr Haak concurs: "None of the dynamic changes we observed could have been inferred from modern-day genetic data alone, highlighting the potential power of combining ancient DNA studies with archaeology to reconstruct human evolutionary history."</body>

      <body>African elephants have demonstrated what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.In a series of tests, researcher Ann Smet, of the University of St Andrews, offered the animals a choice between two identical buckets, then pointed at the one containing a hidden treat.From the first trial, the elephants chose the correct bucket.The results are published in the journal Current Biology.The scientists worked with captive elephants at a lodge in Zimbabwe.Prof Richard Byrne, a co-author on the research, said the elephants had been rescued from culling operations and trained for riding."They specifically train the elephants to respond to vocal cues. They don't use any gestures at all," said Prof Byrne."The idea is that the handler can walk behind the elephant and just tell it what to do with words."Despite this, the animals seemed to grasp the meaning of pointing from the outset. This makes them the only non-human animals to understand the gesture without being trained to do so.In previous studies, Prof Byrne said, our closest primate cousins, the chimpanzees, proved to be "hopeless" at at similar task.Ms Smet added that she had been impressed by the animals' apparently innate understanding of the gesture."Of course we had hoped that the elephants would be able to learn to follow human pointing, or we wouldn't have done the experiment in the first place," she said."But it was really surprising that they didn't seem to have to learn anything."It seems that understanding pointing is an ability elephants just possess naturally and they are cognitively much more like us than has been realised."Prof Byrne said studying elephants helped build a map of part of the evolutionary tree that is very distant from humans."They're so unrelated to us," he told BBC News. "So if we find human-like abilities in an animal like an elephant, that hasn't shared a common ancestor with people for more than 100 million years , we can be pretty sure that it's evolved completely separately, by what's called convergent evolution."The researchers said their findings might explain how elephants have successfully been tamed and have "historically had a close bond with humans, in spite of being potentially dangerous and unmanageable due to their great size".But the scientists added the results could be a hint that the animals gesture to one another in the wild with their "highly controllable trunks".Ms Smet told BBC News: "The next step [in our research] is to test whether when an elephant extends its trunk upwards and outwards - as they regularly do, such as when detecting a predator, this functions as a point."</body>

      <body>Scott Carpenter, one of the original members of the Mercury 7 - Nasa's first group of astronauts - has died aged 88, his family has announced.In 1962 Mr Carpenter became the second American to orbit the earth, piloting the Aurora 7 spacecraft through three revolutions of the earth.After retiring in 1969 he took up oceanographic activities.John Glenn, who flew the first orbital mission, is the last surviving member of the Mercury team.Scott Carpenter's wife, Patty Barrett, said her husband had suffered complications following a stroke in September and died in a Denver hospice.He lived in Vail, Colorado.Mr Carpenter, who was born in Boulder, Colorado, was commissioned in the US Navy in 1949 and served as a pilot during the Korean War.In April 1959 he was selected as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts and underwent training with Nasa, specialising in communication and navigation.He was the backup pilot for John Glenn during preparation for the first US manned orbital space flight in February 1962, and gave the historic send-off to his teammate: "Godspeed, John Glenn.''During his own flight, Scott Carpenter's capsule landed 288 miles away from where it was meant to, leaving Nasa and the nation waiting anxiously to see if he had survived.The Navy recovered him from the Caribbean, floating in his life-raft with his feet propped up.In a joint lecture with John Glenn 49 years later at the Smithsonian Institution, Mr Carpenter recalled his feelings from that time."You're looking out at a totally black sky, seeing an altimeter reading of 90,000ft and realise you are going straight up. And the thought crossed my mind: What am I doing?''Scott Carpenter did not go back into space but later joined the US Navy's SeaLab II programme and in 1965 spent 30 days under the ocean off the coast of California.After retirement he founded his company Sea Sciences, working closely with diver and researcher Jacques Cousteau.</body>

      <title>World adopts landmark mercury treaty</title>

      <body>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.Mercury can produce a range of adverse human health effects, including permanent damage to the nervous system.The UN treaty was formally adopted at a high level meeting in Japan.The Minamata Convention was named after the Japanese city that, in the 1950s, saw one of the world's worst cases of mercury poisoning.In January, four years of negotiations concluded with more than 140 countries agreeing on a set of legally binding measures to curb mercury pollution.UN data showed that mercury emissions were rising in a number of developing nations.The convention regulates a range of areas, including:Earlier this year, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) published a report warning that developing nations were facing growing health and environmental risks from increased exposure to mercury.It said a growth in small-scale mining and coal burning were the main reasons for the rise in emissions.As a result of rapid industrialisation, South-East Asia was the largest regional emitter and accounted for almost half of the element's annual global emissions, it said.'Highly toxic'Mercury - a heavy, silvery white metal - is a liquid at room temperature and can evaporate easily. Within the environment, it is found in cinnabar deposits. It is also found in natural forms in a range of other rocks, including limestone and coal.Mercury can be released into the environment through a number of industrial processes including mining, metal and cement production, and the burning of fossil fuels.Once emitted, it persists in the environment for a long time - circulating through air, water, soil and living organisms - and can be dispersed over vast distances.The World Health Organization (WHO) says: "Mercury is highly toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the (unborn) child and early in life."The inhalation of mercury vapour can produce harmful effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, lungs and kidneys, and may be fatal."The inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested."The Unep assessment said the concentration of mercury in the top 100m of the world's oceans had doubled over the past century, and estimated that 260 tonnes of the toxic metal had made their way from soil into rivers and lakes.Another characteristic, it added, was that mercury became more concentrated as it moved up the food chain, reaching its highest levels in predator fish that could be consumed by humans.Campaigners urged nations to sign the land-mark agreement."Millions of people around the world are exposed to the toxic effect of mercury," said Juliane Kippenberg, senior children's right researcher at Human Rights Watch."This treaty will help protect both the environment and people's right to health."</body>

      <body>Russia has replaced the head of its space programme, Vladimir Popovkin.The move follows a series of setbacks including an unmanned rocket that crashed and exploded seconds after lift-off.Oleg Ostapenko, who was previously a deputy defence minister, was appointed the new space chief by prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Prior to his ministerial role, Ostapenko served as commander of the military's space forces.Speaking to Mr Ostapenko, Mr Medvedev said: "You've been engaged in the space industry all your life including at the military posts."Now you are set to be involved with space in a slightly different dimension. No doubt that this topic is complex and requires greater attention from the state."The outgoing Vladimir Popovkin had been in the role for two-and-a-half years. He was appointed in April 2011 during a time of difficulty with the country's space programme. Russia had lost three satellites when a rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean.Mr Popovkin had pledged to improve manufacturing standards and quality checks, but he struggled to deliver.His time as head was marked by embarrassments including the explosion of an unmanned Russian Proton-M rocket, crashed after its launch from the Russian Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.The accident was captured live by Russian television in July and the crash spread hundreds of tonnes of toxic rocket fuel.Other countries still depend on Russia to launch manned rockets to the International Space Station.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <title>'Early birds' find worms for dinner</title>

      <body>Birds, such as great and blue tits, search for food in the morning but only return to eat it in late afternoon, scientists have found.The team believe the behaviour maximises their chances of avoiding predators during the day without starving to death overnight.Researchers from the University of Oxford tracked the birds' winter foraging movements using tiny tags.All five of the studied species of songbirds behaved in the same way.The results are published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters."Our results are important because they provide a new hypothesis for how animals forage," said Damien Farine, lead author from the University of Oxford."They suggest that animals integrate the different risks they face into one strategy that can be applied to satisfy both their need to avoid predation and avoid risk."Scientists have been studying bird populations at Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK since 1947.Finding food becomes more and more relevant towards the end of the winter when large sources of food, such as beech mast, have become depleted.The team knew from previous studies that, when the predation risk appears high, birds delay putting on fat until late in the day."In the 1970s, when there were almost no sparrowhawks, tits used to be much fatter [in winter], which helped them avoid the risk of starvation."When sparrowhawks returned [in greater numbers], the average body weight of great tits, for example, decreased," Mr Farine told BBC Nature.According to Mr Farine these birds had shifted from a strategy of being fat, to a strategy where they delayed putting on fat until late in the day."However, no one had previously thought to test how birds manage the need to find food so that they can ensure that there will be enough food left at the end of the day in order to put on the necessary amount of fat and survive the long winter nights," he said.Instead of simply idly waiting until the afternoon, birds were actively seeking out new sources of food to work out where their next meal was coming from.Mr Farine said: "They can vary their strategy within the day in order to satisfy multiple needs, in this case avoiding predation but also finding ephemeral food."Mr Farine said he was hoping to test a number of questions that arose from these results.Previous studies have shown that along the social ties, information about food sources are transmitted between individual birds within a population."We would like to test if individuals vary in their use of this social information over the course of a day. For example, if they have not gained good quality information in the morning, do they ignore it and search for their own food?" Mr Farine told BBC Nature."We would then like conduct further research on the afternoon and evening strategies in order to test whether the birds actually do remember what the best site was that they visited by placing different quality foods out for them to discover."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Fears for science amid US shutdown</title>
      <description>American scientists are scrambling to preserve vital research programmes amid the US government funding shutdown.</description>

      <body>American scientists are scrambling to preserve vital research programmes amid the US government funding shutdown.Key projects investigating ice loss in Antarctica are among those at risk as plans for fieldwork are stalled.If the expeditions do not go ahead, it could jeopardise investigations that have gathered data over decades.Medical research, including studies of degenerative disease, is also held up as government-employed scientists have been sent home.The case of the National Science Foundation is typical of many US funding bodies - it has closed its front door and no-one is answering calls or emails. Websites of the likes of Nasa are redirecting to holding pages.The chief concern among scientists is that long-running projects monitoring change could now be harmed by a sudden break in the flow of data.One major initiative known as IceBridge - which uses aircraft to study the edges of the ice-sheet in West Antarctica, and is regarded as crucial for understanding future sea-level rise - has been delayed by two weeks already.The planes are fitted with laser and radar systems to measure the height of the ice sheet as it approaches the coast - and gathering annual data is essential for researchers trying to understand patterns of change.The plan for the approaching field season in Antarctica was to operate the plane from landing strips on the ice but this will become impossible later next month as temperatures rise with the Southern Hemisphere summer, potentially putting at risk the entire season's fieldwork.Teams involved in the project are known to be working on contingency plans in the hope that a budget deal can be struck soon by US President Barack Obama and the House of Representatives.With official lines of communication between funding agencies and scientists currently suspended, many have resorted to private corridors to maintain some level of organisation. Information is being passed through Gmail and Hotmail accounts, and through social media such as Facebook and Twitter.The message put out to Antarctic researchers on Wednesday was that the upcoming season was not all lost. Many groups are not due to go out until December, and so there is still the chance that some projects can be rescued."But there is this overwhelming sense of confusion and frustration, and the inability to get clear information on what is going on because the NSF has closed along with the other government agencies," one university glaciologist told the BBC."We've been told to keep planning for the Antarctic season, but it's like being at school and all the teachers have gone home; you don't know where to go for guidance because they're not there."With many major research projects now run internationally, the effect of the US shutdown will also be felt by scientists beyond the United States.Several British polar scientists are thought to be scheduled to join American expeditions but face being delayed or even losing out completely.For the moment, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is insisting that the impact on UK polar science will be minimal.But Prof Jane Francis, director of BAS, warned in a statement that, "the potential loss of data which would be collected by American scientists, and shared with other research teams, would have an impact on the science we conduct."At present, BAS is working on the assumption the US financial situation will be resolved soon, and any joint work can go ahead as planned. We are monitoring the situation on a daily basis."One American project known as RICE, investigating a margin of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is due to involve scientists from China, New Zealand, Denmark and one researcher from the UK. At the moment, its fate is uncertain.Other fields of research are vulnerable, too - and British scientists are among those raising concerns.Prof John Hardy, of University College London, said: "Vital work on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is being held up while hardworking scientists are being forced to stay at home, without even being allowed to read their email. It is difficult to see how this is fiscally responsible."Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, said: "The biggest lesson we should take from this week's Nobel Prizes is that science doesn't belong to one nation; it's an international and collaborative human enterprise."Our scientists work with American scientists, and the UK public benefits enormously from research that goes on there, as well as vice versa."If the shutdown continues, it's bad news for both scientists and the public here in the UK as well as across the pond."American satellites are still functioning and data is being gathered, but Nasa scientists are among those refused funding to travel to international conferences - a key part of the process of scientific exchange.One leading space agency scientist, speaking from home, told me that the shutdown was "deeply frustrating and very bad for morale - it's illegal for us to work".Instead of managing a research project, he's keeping himself busy in his garden. "The koi pond has never looked better," he said.</body>

      <body>A material called carbyne could be stronger even than graphene or diamond, according to researchers who have calculated its properties.A team says carbyne could have a range of remarkable properties, if it can ever be made in bulk - and some experts have doubted whether this is possible.They have published their findings in the journal ACS Nano.Carbyne is a chain of carbon atoms held together by double or alternating single and triple chemical bonds.In their paper, Boris Yakobson and colleagues from Rice University in Houston show that carbyne's tensile strength - the ability to withstand stretching - surpasses that of "any other known material" and is double that of graphene, the flat sheet of carbon atoms that is often held up as a "supermaterial".Scientists have already calculated that it would take an elephant balancing on a pencil to break through a sheet of graphene.They also calculated that carbyne has twice the tensile stiffness of graphene and carbon nanotubes and nearly three times that of diamond.It should display a number of other useful properties say the researchers. For example, it could be turned into a magnetic semiconductor (these are materials with electrical conductivity between that of a metal and an insulator like glass) and could be used as a sensor to detect twisting.Some scientists have reported synthesising small amounts of carbyne in the lab, but it was thought to be extremely unstable. And some chemists have suggested that two strands coming into contact could react explosively."Our intention was to put it all together, to construct a complete mechanical picture of carbyne as a material," said Vasilii Artyukhov, also from Rice University."The fact that it has been observed tells us it's stable under tension, at least, because otherwise it would just fall apart."</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's find is 'turning point'</title>
      <description>A chemical which can stop brain cell death in a neurodegenerative disease could hold the key for treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases, scientists say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24462699</url>
      <date>1381395409</date>
      <body>The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the "turning point" in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other diseases.In tests on mice, the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented.Prof Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimer's was not imminent but: "I'm very excited, it's the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration."The world won't change tomorrow, but this is a landmark study."The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, based at the University of Leicester, focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells.When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a build-up of viral proteins. Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.However, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or "misfolded" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.This process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.However, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: "They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary."What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first."This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start."She said the compound offered a "new pathway that may well give protective drugs" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.Prof Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.Side effects are an issue. The compound also acted on the pancreas, meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight.Any human drug would need to act only on the brain. However, this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point.David Allsop, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as "very dramatic and highly encouraging" but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage."It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."</body>

      <description>The Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to three scientists who "took the chemical experiment into cyberspace".</description>

      <body>The Nobel Prize in chemistry has gone to three scientists who "took the chemical experiment into cyberspace".Michael Levitt, a British-US citizen of Stanford University; US-Austrian Martin Karplus of Strasbourg University; and US-Israeli Arieh Warshel of the University of Southern California will share the prize.The trio devised computer simulations to understand chemical processes.In doing so, they laid the foundations for new kinds of pharmaceuticals.Today, scientists routinely use modelling to understand how different biological molecules interact, to probe the mechanisms of disease and to design novel drugs."The Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 2013 have made it possible to map the mysterious ways of chemistry by using computers," said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."Today the computer is just as important a tool for chemists as the test tube."Detailed knowledge of chemical processes makes it possible to optimise catalysts, drugs and solar cells."Warshel told a news conference in Stockholm by telephone that he was "extremely happy" to be woken in the middle of the night in Los Angeles to find out he had won the prize."In short, what we developed is a way for computers to take the structure of a protein and then to eventually understand how exactly it does what it does," he told reporters.Marinda Li Wu, president of the American Chemical Society, said the award was "very exciting"."The winners have laid the groundwork for linking classic experimental science with theoretical science through computer models."The resulting insights are helping us develop new medicines; for example, their work is being used to determine how a drug could interact with a protein in the body to treat disease."Martyn Poliakoff, vice-president of Britain's Royal Society, said the award was "important recognition" for a major advance in theoretical chemistry."Their novel approach combined both classical and quantum physics, and now enables us to understand how very large molecules react," he explained."This prize highlights the increasing role that theoretical and computational chemistry are playing in this area of science."All three men spent varying periods at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. Michael Levitt started his PhD at the Medical Research Council facility at the end of the 1960s.Dr Richard Henderson, a current LMB scientist, said the trio's work was hugely important."They came at it from different angles but with a common goal," he told BBC News."They developed computer mathematical models for the forces that hold together mainly proteins, but other biological structures as well. They listed all the forces between atoms, and then they put these into one big computer program and set it running."In this way, they could simulate in the computer the behaviour of real proteins as they folded and unfolded, as they bind substrates and ligands."They were really the first people to push this field forward, and today it has become a worldwide industry."Michael Levitt himself said this success was due in large part to the spectacular performance of modern computing: "I've told people that the silent partner in this prize is the incredible development in computer power."When we started this, no-one had any clue that computers were going to become so powerful; no-one knew about Moore's Law."This incredible increase in computer power has taken everybody by surprise, and I think this is one of the reasons why our field has become so important. And it's just going to get bigger and bigger."</body>

      <title>Higgs boson wins Nobel physics prize</title>
      <description>Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson, discovered at Cern in 2012.</description>

      <date>1381240861</date>
      <body>Two scientists have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson.Peter Higgs, from the UK, and Francois Englert from Belgium, share the prize.In the 1960s, they were among several physicists who proposed a mechanism to explain why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass.The mechanism predicts a particle - the Higgs boson - which was finally discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland."This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference," said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Prof Higgs is renowned for shying away from the limelight, and he could not be located for interview in the immediate aftermath of the announcement."He's gone on holiday without a phone," his Edinburgh University physics colleague Alan Walker told the BBC, adding that Higgs had also been unwell."He is taking a break from all of this, taking some time to relax, because he knows when he comes back he'll have to face up to a media storm."But the university released a prepared statement from Higgs, 84, who is an emeritus professor of theoretical physics:"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy," he said."I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle and to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support."I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research."Francois Englert, 80, said he was "very happy" to win the award, speaking at the ceremony via phone link."At first I thought I didn't have [the prize] because I didn't see the announcement," he told the committee, after their news conference was delayed by more than an hour.Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but it was in Edinburgh in 1964 that he had his big idea - an explanation of why the matter in the Universe has substance, or mass.His theory involved a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics, which has come to be known as the Higgs boson.Within weeks, Francois Englert had independently published his own, similar theory, alongside his now deceased colleague Robert Brout.Three other physicists - Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen - also made key contributions to the theory, and spoke at the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.Hagen has long argued for the name of the particle to be changed, protesting at the "rock star" status in which Higgs is held.And Higgs, too, has expressed his discomfort with the attention he has received, preferring to call the particle "the scalar boson".In a statement on Tuesday, Kibble, of Imperial College London, said he was "glad" the Nobel prize had gone to the work of Higgs and Englert."My two collaborators, Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and I contributed to that discovery, but our paper was unquestionably the last of the three to be published."It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish Academy felt unable to include us, constrained as they are by a self-imposed rule that the prize cannot be shared by more than three people."My sincere congratulations go to the two prize winners, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs."And the renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking added his praise: "In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson. The discovery last year at Cern of a particle with the correct properties confirms this prediction and is a triumph for theory."Proving the theory correct took almost half a century and involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built.The LHC at Cern lies in a circular tunnel 27km (17 miles) round. It is so big it is partly in Switzerland, partly in France. It took 10 years and thousands of scientists and engineers to build it.Cern director general Rolf Heuer said he was "thrilled" that this year's prize had gone to particle physics."The discovery of the Higgs boson at Cern... marks the culmination of decades of intellectual effort by many people around the world," he commented.The Nobel prizes - which also cover chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics - are valued at 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m). Laureates also receive a medal and a diploma.The official citation for Englert and Higgs read: "For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the Atlas and CMS experiments at Cern's Large Hadron Collider".David Willetts, UK minister for universities and science, said the award was "an incredible endorsement of the quality of UK science".Prime Minister David Cameron said: "This brilliant achievement is richly deserved recognition of Peter Higgs' lifetime of dedicated research and his passion for science."It is also a credit to the world-leading British universities in which this research was carried out."It took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the Higgs boson after Prof Higgs proposed it, and he and all those people should be extremely proud."</body>

      <body>China has criticised the US space agency Nasa over its decision to bar Chinese scientists from attending a conference in the United States.The meeting is a key event for scientists searching for planets beyond the solar system.Nasa has rejected applications from Chinese nationals, citing a new security law.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called the move "discriminatory".The conference is for US and international teams who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme.It will be held at Nasa's Ames research centre in California next month.Nasa has based its ban on a new law which prohibits anyone from China setting foot in any of its buildings.The law, passed in March, is part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by congressman Frank Wolf, chair of the House appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa.The counter-espionage legislation aims to restrict foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities.Nasa's decision has angered many US scientists who say Chinese students and researchers in their labs are being discriminated against.A growing number of US scientists have decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior academics withdrawing individually, or pulling out their entire research groups.Rep Wolf himself called Nasa's decision "inaccurate".He said the purpose of the law was to prevent Nasa from co-operating with the Chinese government and Chinese-owned companies, not individuals.At a regular news briefing in Beijing, Chinese spokeswoman Ms Hua said she was aware of reports on Nasa's decision."At the same time I have also noticed that the discriminatory action by Nasa has also met opposition" in the United States, she added."We think that these academic meetings should not be politicised."</body>

      <title>Minister considers gassing badgers</title>
      <description>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, environment secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <date>1381437158</date>
      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said the gassing of badgers was "inhumane" and she hoped Mr Paterson's words "will not be interpreted as a green light for illegal gassing of settings, of which there have been credible reports".She called for a "coordinated plan across England to vaccinate badgers and improve biosecurity to reduce transmission among cattle and between cattle, badgers and other wildlife".Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting. It has ended in Somerset and is due to finish in Gloucestershire on Monday.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>Mixed fortunes for Cape vultures</title>
      <description>Expanding networks of pylons and power lines in southern Africa are extending Cape vultures' foraging range but it comes at a cost, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Cape vultures in southern Africa are using expanding networks of pylons and power lines to extend their range, say scientists.At the same time these lines are also contributing to this threatened bird of prey's decline through fatal collisions and electrocutions.The study involved a team of experts from the UK and South Africa tracking individual bird movements using GPS.The results are published in the online journal PLoS One.Southern Africa's Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres) - like many other species of vulture - are in decline. Contributing factors include feeding on illegally poisoned carcasses and fatal collisions with wind turbines and power lines.To understand more about their movements, and how these vultures interact with power lines, a team of scientists fitted GPS devices to five adult and four immature birds."What we were trying to find out was how far they were going and what sort of areas they were feeding in," explained lead researcher Louis Phipps from Nottingham Trent University, UK.They thought the birds would be travelling large distances, but were not expecting the vultures to be travelling across almost the whole of southern Africa."Their individual home ranges on average cover an area larger than the British Isles which is a huge area and among the largest areas of any vulture," said Mr Phipps.From the capture site the birds travelled up to 1,000km (621 miles) in a straight line and as a group entered five different countries, regularly crossing international borders."It seems that their movement actually followed the pattern and distribution of where those [power] lines were and have been constructed," he said.According to Mr Phipps these vultures are using the pylons and power lines as roosting and perching sites where no other suitable perches are available, allowing them to travel beyond the recognised range for this species.And because they are spending more time in the vicinity of these power lines, the vultures are at a higher risk of colliding with the overhead wires. Even though they could travel further by using the power lines as roost sites, there is an increased risk of fatalities."So just as a mortality factor power lines are bad, but potentially they may be benefitting them by furthering their range to the west," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature.The study also examined the role of protected areas and wildlife reserves."Our data actually shows that although vultures, especially Cape vultures, definitely need these areas for protection...they actually spend most of their time foraging on private farmland."This leaves them exposed to the full range of threats in the wider landscape, more exposed to poisoned livestock carcasses and harmful veterinary drugs which was the cause of the Asian vulture population collapse."Mr Phipps explained that as GPS tracking is very accurate it shows exactly where vultures are foraging, building on this data in the future will allow co-ordinated cross border conservation measures to be implemented in exactly the right areas."There are lots of factors playing against each other that make the vultures' daily life a very big struggle," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature."On balance power lines are not a good thing for vultures."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Strategy focuses on UK trees' future</title>
      <description>An official strategy is due to be unveiled that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved woodlands.</description>

      <date>1381287732</date>
      <body>An official strategy is due to be unveiled later that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved tree species.The strategy has been developed by Forest Research, part of the Forestry Commission, and two charities, the Earth Trust and Future Trees Trust.It will be launched by environment minister Lord De Mauley at an event in Westminster.It encourages people to choose seeds and saplings carefully to ensure that the trees which they plant do well.Broadleaved trees are those which have wide leaves rather than the needle-like leaves of conifers. They include ash, beech, birch, elm, holly, hornbeam, lime, oak and poplar.The document's authors say broadleaved woodlands have declined over the past 200 years, resulting in 95% of hardwood timber now having to be imported.The 16-page vision, called A Future With Broadleaved Trees, says the trees have a "very special place in our national psyche" but are "much more than just beautiful things".Co-author Dr Steve Lee from Forest Research - the scientific arm of the Forestry Commission - explained: "If they are good quality and grow well, they will lock up carbon for a long period of time. Also, you can make good quality products from the timber, which will last for a very long time."The act of planting a tree, and the cost of that tree, is probably going to be the same regardless of where you get it from," he told BBC News."So you could plant a maladapted tree, wait a long time and it does not grow very well. Yet you could invest the same amount of money in another tree, which grows very well and remains more resilient to any changes that come along in terms of climate, pests and diseases."What we are really saying that the effort is the same, so look around before you plant and think hard about what it is and why it is you are planting those trees."The strategy, which looks ahead to 2025, is centred around three core objectives:Earth Trust chief executive Jayne Manley explained: "Our much loved broadleaved trees could provide significant benefits to people and the environment as well as the rural economy."We need to focus on these trees rather than take them for granted and part of this is identifying and planting 'improved' trees which are productive, healthy and adaptable."Dr Lee added: "What you are really after is something that will remain well adapted on that site and will remain resilient to any environmental impacts that may occur over the 80-year or so rotation period."The suggestion is that the local material, which you might have planted in the past without really thinking about it, might not be the most resilient in the future."</body>

      <title>'No bailout' for the Earth's climate</title>
      <description>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned by the OECD that there will be no bailout if there is a climate crisis.</description>

      <body>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned there will be no bailout if there is a crisis in the Earth's climate system.That is the view of the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Angel Gurria is expected to rebuke nations failing to curb CO2 emissions in a speech on Wednesday.He will say the analysis of the climate threat is far clearer than were the warning signs for the financial crisis.Mr Gurria is due to address the topic of climate change, investment and energy policies in a London lecture co-organised with the London School of Economics and the Climate Markets and Investors Association (CMIA)The talk coincides with a report in The Independent newspaper that claims UK Chancellor George Osborne is about to reject the recommendations of government advisers by slowing the drive to tackle global warming.In his speech, Mr Gurria will ask if leaders overseeing the financial system that led to the "train wreck" of the banking crisis would have been happy to take the risks if they had known the consequences.“Unlike the financial crisis, we do not have a 'climate bailout option' up our sleeves,” he will say.“And despite all the attention given to climate change deniers, our understanding of the scale of the risk is much better developed than our understanding of the financial risks, pre-crisis.”An OECD source said the secretary-general's remarks were directed both at countries which had dragged their feet on reducing emissions and those which had taken a leadership position but were now starting to wobble.Asked if the latter group included the UK, where the chancellor argued last week that Britain "should not be in front of the rest of the world” in tackling climate change, the source said the OECD was fully aware of the situation in Britain and all its member states.Mr Gurria will also warn that renewable technologies will be harmed by stop-start policies. Renewables firms in the UK have benefited from a stable policy framework in the medium term, but are uncertain about long-term investments as right-wing Conservatives attempt to abandon CO2 targets for 2030, arguing that they damage competitiveness.He also takes a swipe at fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at over $500bn a year globally. These typically provide cheap motoring for the rich, he says, and fail to help the poor.The world, he says, needs to become zero-carbon in the second half of the century, and needs to start on that pathway immediately if climate change is to be stabilised.Mr Gurria, like the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week, is trying to galvanise action for an ambitious agreement in the planned 2015 UN climate conference in Paris.Rich nation governments struggling against recession have been going slow on climate change policies, and developing nations have argued that they need space to expand emissions to grow their economies and draw people out of poverty.Mr Gurria will argue that creating an infrastructure that leaves people dependent on fossil fuels will prove more costly overall in terms of the economy and public welfare.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: "Countries like Britain have been leading the charge (on climate change) and have to continue to do that. It's because of leadership of UK that EU has seen that this is the way to go - and the rest of the world too."He said energy policy has become extra challenging following technology improvements on exploiting fossil fuels. "We grew up with scarcity of oil and fuel, now we are entering a world of abundance so we're really going to have to think very hard on this."The OECD is to publish a paper on the most effective ways of managing carbon cuts in the economy.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin</body>

      <title>Too much sex kills male marsupials</title>
      <description>Some species of marsupials are dying from sex after engaging in strenuous mating activities.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443104</url>
      <date>1381237115</date>
      <body>A new study suggests that some species of marsupials mate with such vigour and intensity that it quite literally kills them.The scientists say that males die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time.A key factor in this costly coitus is the promiscuous behaviour of females who all breed at the same time of year.The study is published in the journal PNAS.Suicidal reproduction or semelparity is well known in many species of plants and fish but is rare in mammals.This new study looks at the mating behaviour of 52 different species of small, insect eating marsupials in Australia, South America and Papua New Guinea.They found that in some of these animals, such as the antechinus, the phascogale and the dasykaluta, male attempts to father offspring cost them their lives.This "dying-off" trait is more likely to be found in species living in regions where food was plentiful in one period of the year.This makes the females of the species more likely to shorten their mating seasons so they only give birth when there is plenty to eat.In these marsupials, the females have also synchronised their reproductive cycles.They are also highly promiscuous, as this promotes sperm competition among the males, explained Dr Diana Fisher from the University of Queensland, the lead author of the study."The females that mate with more males, get to weed out the poor quality males because of this sperm competition," she said."The ones that succeeded in fertilisation were the ones with better offspring survival."While this ensures sturdy descendents, the process is fatal for the fathers.The males attempt to mate with as many females as possible in long, laborious bouts, driven by high levels of hormones including testosterone.These chemicals in turn elevate their levels of stress hormones and their systems are unable to cope, says Dr Fisher."If we humans get huge stress, we have a feedback system and we bring it down."But the marsupials just keep ramping it up more and more and are driven to spend all their time mating competitively.She added: "And its the stress hormone that does that."Dr Fisher says that this is sexual selection driven by females. It is a different strategy to other mammals where the males sometimes fight for the right to mate or are selected by the females on the basis of looks or strength."In this case, it is having the one that's best at sperm competition," she said.The research team says that the strategy of losing half the species in the act of reproduction can work well as an evolutionary strategy if the population is dense."Every other animal has a cost of reproduction," said Dr Fisher."It's just they've got it all at once."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Plastic pollution 'threatens lakes'</title>
      <description>Researchers say that the problem of plastic pollution is posing a growing threat to lakes as well as oceans.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24434378</url>
      <date>1381183230</date>
      <body>Pollution with plastic waste is not confined to the oceans but poses a growing threat to lakes as well.That is the view of researchers who found significant concentrations of the substance in Italy's Lake Garda.They say the levels are similar to those found in samples taken from marine beach sediments.They are concerned that these tiny plastic particles are accumulating in freshwater species and are "likely" to get into the food chain.The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.The problem of large amounts of plastic polluting the world's oceans has been well documented in recent years.As well as bigger pieces that can choke sea creatures when ingested, there is an equally serious issue with very small fragments called micro-plastics.But research on the problems caused by plastic in lakes has been lacking.This new study looked at Lake Garda, a large, sub-alpine body of water. The researchers found significant concentrations of plastic in sediment samples. On the north shore they found around 1,000 larger particles per square metre and 450 micro-plastic particles in the same area."We were surprised," lead author Prof Christian Laforsch from the University of Bayreuth told BBC News."We have similar amounts of plastic particles in the sediment of the lake's ecosystem as we find in marine ecosystems."Chemicals found in plastics can be poisonous, can damage endocrine systems or in some cases cause cancers.They can also transport dangerous organic pollutants into clean environments like lakes.Previous research on fish and other marine creatures has shown that these species tend to accumulate tiny plastic fragments into their tissue. Prof Laforsch worries that this is happening in Lake Garda and elsewhere."What we show is that filter feeders and sediment feeders and organisms that feed on the surface layer of the lake, all swallow these plastic particles mistaking them for food."There might be impacts when it affects the hormone system, they could become sterile for example. It could also be, that when fish are feeding on these organisms they accumulate these particles also in their tissue."The problem is being caused by human use of plastic materials say the researchers.Apart from water sports, and tourist and fishing boats, the main sources of waste entering Lake Garda were discarded plastic products and debris which may originate from landfill sites.The scientists are also concerned that the discovery of significant amounts of plastic in lake environments could have implications for human populations as the waters are often used for drinking and for agriculture.And they argue that, as in the seas, plastic pollution is likely to be widespread in freshwater bodies."There is nothing particular about Lake Garda," said Prof Laforsch."We are testing in Bavaria and it looks pretty much the same. It is, I think, a problem all over Europe and maybe all over the world."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <body>A platypus that got stuck in a car engine in Australia has been safely released back into the wild, Australian conservation officials say.The female platypus wedged itself inside the engine bay of a car driving through a flooded river crossing south of Canberra late on Wednesday.It was driven more than 15km (9 miles) before the driver realised an animal was in the car.Officials described the incident as a "one-in-a-million" event.The driver, Cameron Blaseotto, said he heard scratching from under his car bonnet when he parked his car.He and his friend "originally thought a possum or something was going to jump out at both of us", he told Australian broadcaster ABC."We had a bit of an argument about who was going to open the engine bay," he added.They were surprised to discover a platypus stuck in the engine bay, and called the territory's Parks and Conservation Service."Our urban wildlife rangers get calls ranging from snakes in houses to quolls (a carnivorous marsupial) in trees, but this was definitely one of our most unusual calls," Regional Operations Manager Brett McNamara said."There's obviously many moving parts within an engine bay and given platypus have claws there is not much to hang onto," he said."How this animal was able to climb up inside, hang on, and then drive all the way back into Canberra is a truly remarkable story."Mr McNamara added that the platypus, who was in perfect health, was returned to her home and released on Thursday morning.Platypuses - egg-laying mammals with a duck-like bill - are native to Australia.</body>

      <body>An orphaned red squirrel is being care for after being rescued in woodland near Inverness, a charity has said.A member of the public spotted the four to five-week-old lying on the forest floor while walking in Daviot Woods.She took her to the Scottish SPCA's Highlands and Islands animal rescue and rehoming centre, where she was syringe-fed by staff - who named her Dizzee.The squirrel has since been transferred to the charity's centre at Fishcross, near Alloa.Centre assistant manager Colin Liddell said: "Dizzee was only 90g when she arrived in our care but she's come on leaps and bounds over the past three weeks and has now almost doubled in size and is weighing in at a very healthy 165g."Wildlife assistant Sheelagh McAllister has been providing Dizzee with round-the-clock care which includes taking her home at night to continue her hand-feeding."Dizzee's now starting to eat solid foods, including shelled nuts, and she's ready to be moved into an outdoor enclosure."This is when we take a completely hands-off approach to allow Dizzee to establish her natural fear of humans."She'll have lots of space to run and jump and develop her fitness in preparation for release back into the wild in around two weeks' time."</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478942</url>
      <date>1381417427</date>
      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Does it matter why we help others?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24457645</url>
      <date>1381360309</date>
      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>NSA chief pledges more transparency</title>
      <description>US electronic spy agency chief speaks to the BBC</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24470450</url>
      <date>1381407161</date>
      <body>The US electronic spy agency is committed to being more transparent, a senior official has told the BBC.In a rare interview on a recent visit to London, National Security Agency (NSA) Deputy Director Chris Inglis spoke to the BBC about cyber-security.His comments came in the wake of revelations about the agency's work from former contractor Edward Snowden.Mr Snowden's leaks sparked a debate about secrecy and the scale of the agency's powers.In the interview, Mr Inglis said there was a need to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence.With the world becoming more reliant on the internet, Mr Inglis outlined concerns over three threats in cyberspace: the theft of intellectual property and secrets; disruption of networks (for instance, attacks that have taken websites of American banks offline in recent months); and destructive acts such as those that targeted Saudi Aramco last year, destroying tens of thousands of computers."There is no failure of imagination in this space," he said of those seeking to exploit the internet.Dealing with threats requires more being done by both the private sector and the government to better defend networks and deter adversaries, he said.Responses to cyber attacks - such as those on American banks, which many commentators believe came from Iran - needed to be carefully thought through and might involve a range of tools, the NSA's number-two said."If at the end of the day we were to determine that those were attributable to another nation state, then surely we might think that is then the crossing of a red line," Mr Inglis said. "But the response should be proportionate," adding that it may come from the private sector rather than government.Dealing with commercial espionage in cyberspace, he said, might also involve a range of measures including private or public diplomatic pressure and the targeting of individuals for criminal prosecution.The job of the NSA, Mr Inglis said, was to exploit networks to collect intelligence in cyberspace and to defend certain networks - but not carry out destructive acts."NSA had a responsibility from way back, from our earliest days, to both break codes and make codes," he said. "We have a responsibility to do intelligence in a space we once called the telecommunications arena - now cyberspace - and the responsibility to make codes or to defend signals communications of interest."That's different than what most people conceive as offence or attack in this space."That task of destructive cyber attack, if ordered, lies with the US military's rapidly expanding Cyber Command.However, both the NSA and Cyber Command are led by the same man - General Keith Alexander - because the three fields of exploiting, defending and attacking are closely related."We realised a long time ago that the predicate for all those actions is first understanding how cyberspace works," Mr Inglis said. "Second: finding, fixing, holding in your mind's eye the thing that you would either defend, or exploit or attack. And then - and only then - do you make that final choice about what you are going to do about that."At least in the military component, the US has chosen to invest all those things in a single person such that that person may then orient and synchronise those activities in a way that they complement each other."Mr Inglis has worked for more than 25 years in the NSA, the last seven as deputy director, the highest-ranking civilian.There is no doubt that the last few months will have been the most difficult as the NSA - which was so secret people used to joke that its initials stood for "no such agency" - has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by the leaks by Mr Snowden."I do think there needs to be more transparency," Mr Inglis told the BBC."We've had a discussion many times across the summer about the need to perhaps rebalance the balance between national security and civil liberties," he said."I don't think that is the case. I think that both of those must be given equal and full support. I don't think that we trade one for the other."But I do think we have to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence or [that of] those who stand in the shoes of the public and act on their behalf, say in the Congress," Mr Inglis added. "There needs to be greater transparency and we are committed to that."The revelations from Mr Snowden have indicated a scale of capability that has surprised even close observers of the NSA and its British partner GCHQ, and this has raised concerns over whether the capabilities are sufficiently accountable."I can appreciate that people are nervous," Mr Inglis said."And we ourselves at NSA need to respect that and therefore offer up whatever is necessary in terms of transparency to secure the confidence of our overseers and beyond them the American public - and for that matter allies."One of the tensions for the NSA over many years is the balance between its two roles of defending networks and exploiting them for intelligence.The most controversial revelation within the cyber security community was the claim that the NSA had been deliberately weakening some of the security protocols surrounding encryption, either by introducing back doors or by modifying international standards to ensure it could gain access to gather intelligence on its targets."What we have found over time is that our adversaries are using precisely the same communication systems, services, pathways as our citizens," Mr Inglis told the BBC."But in pursuing our adversaries we must also defend our citizens," he said. "We must not hold them at risk. And so we do try to crack the encryption used by terrorists and other adversaries in that system. We need to make sure that we do not hold at risk the encryption that is used by US citizens.""So that's rule one and we do in fact find ways to do precisely that," he added. "It is false to imagine or say that NSA broadly has the capability to decrypt most of the encryption that is used by any citizen in the world but in particular US citizens."The revelations by the Guardian newspaper that the NSA was collecting metadata about US communications raised concerns that the agency was getting involved in domestic surveillance.Mr Inglis argued that this collection operated under constraints."Beyond saying that I'm not Big Brother I think we are committed to demonstrating we are not Big Brother," he said, adding that this would involve illuminating the controls on the NSA's actions and performance statistics on those controls.Even beyond the revelations by Mr Snowden, the role of the NSA in cyberspace and the resulting questions of where responsibility lies for defence, intelligence gathering and attack mean the agency is unlikely to be able to retreat back into the secrecy that it enjoyed for so long.</body>

      <title>Bloodhound Diary: Building on the tides</title>
      <description>Precise engineering that factors in the tides</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24458799</url>
      <date>1381334307</date>
      <body>A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle will mount an assault on the land speed record. The vehicle will be run on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa, in 2015 and 2016.Wing Commander Andy Green, world land-speed record holder, is writing a diary for the BBC News website about his experiences working on the Bloodhound project and the team's efforts to inspire national interest in science and engineering.It was exactly 30 years ago that Thrust 2 broke the World Land Speed Record - 633mph - and brought the record back to Britain.Until then, it seemed that the US had taken the record away from us for good, with all their new-fangled jet and rocket technology.Fortunately for Britain, a certain Richard Noble decided that we should get it back.When he set the record in 1983, he reminded us (and the rest of the world) that Britain was still a world-beater.Now, 30 years later, we're building something that would go past Thrust 2 like it's standing still - Bloodhound SSC, the world's first 1,000mph car.We have the best motorsports industry in the world (if you need proof, just have a look at where all the Formula 1 teams are based) and one of the best aerospace industries (see the RAF's world-class new Typhoon aircraft for further details).Bloodhound is going to be a product of both industries, with a bit of space technology thrown in.It's another world champion in the making.The car is being assembled at our Technical Centre in Bristol, and every time I see it, more parts have been added.It's also attracting attention from all over the globe: we've got more than 200 countries following it on the Bloodhound SSC website.One of the impressive things about the build is the precision involved.For example, we are aiming to assemble the fin to an accuracy of better than 1/12th of a degree.The whole car is being assembled with this kind of precision with the aid of a "surface table" - a super-flat, 7m-long slab of cast iron that weighs 10 tonnes.The accuracy of the build is regularly checked using a Hexagon laser, which will measure the position of any part of the car, in three dimensions, to one millionth of a metre.This has given us a bit of a problem, though, as the surface table (all 10 tonnes of it) keeps moving.After a lot of checking, it would appear that the surface table, and the whole of our Technical Centre, is actually floating.The ends of the table move up and down by a couple of millimetres or so with the tide. We're only a few hundred metres from the River Avon and the tide in the river makes the floor (and the surface table, and therefore our chassis) go up and down very slightly.If we're fitting new components, the first thing we have to do is re-level the chassis, so that the new bits go on perfectly straight.No-one said that building a 1,000mph car was going to be easy - but we didn't expect to be afloat while we were doing it!The last of the rear upper-chassis ribs have now been delivered.These are the big heavy ribs that will have to support the fin, while it's keeping the car straight.The fin has been stressed to take a 25kN (2.5 tonne) side load.I'm staggered by how much that is (we could lay the car on its side and park two normal road cars on the fin) and how little it is (at 1,000mph, the fin will develop 25kN of side load at a yaw angle of only 0.9 degrees).Sounds like my driving might have to be as accurate as the chassis build - although the 2.5 tonnes of correcting force should help.Don't forget that while the fin is doing its best to keep us pointy-end forwards, you can be right there (or at least your name can). If you want your name to travel at 1,000mph, then sign up here to our fin programme.There's more good news from the aerodynamics team this month.We've been worrying about something called the "yaw static margin" for a while now.The yaw static margin is the distance between the centre of gravity and the aerodynamic centre of the car. In other words, this is what keeps the car pointy-end forwards at high speeds.Ideally, we want the car to look like a dart, with the weight up front and big feathers at the back.We were worried that the static margin (a measure of how dart-like the car is) was smaller than we wanted. It turns out that we'd made two small errors in the calculation.One was in the aerodynamic model of the fin, which hadn't captured the latest changes to extend the trailing edge, so that made the centre of yaw move back a bit.The other change was finding an error in the (hugely complex) centre of gravity calculation, which moved it forward almost 300mm. That's a big gain, and suddenly the car is looking a lot more stable.This will make it easier to keep the car pointy-end forwards and, since that's my job as the driver, I'm delighted.While we're running the car on the desert, one of the key things we'll be checking is the wheel loads.These wheel loads are the result of the car's weight plus all the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle, so we're going to be checking all the aerodynamic forces (and pressures) very carefully.I've just seen a computer programme written by David Naumann, a PhD student at Swansea University. David's programme will compare the real-world pressures, from 120 pressure sensors on the car, with the predicted pressures from the Swansea computer model.This will allow us to check the car's performance very rapidly.We're planning to publish the programme before we start running, so that you can check the car's performance for yourself at home, every time we run.It will also let the 5,500 schools in our Education Programme follow the science as we test it. If your school hasn't signed up to our free programme yet, then join the Bloodhound Education Programme here. It's going to be quite an adventure.URT is now finishing off our carbon-fibre intake duct, which is essentially just a tube to feed air to the car's EJ200 jet engine.The intake was made in two halves and then bolted together to form the 2.2m-long tube. It's another part of the car that will see some big forces.At 1,000mph, the intake will be pressurised to 1.6 Bar (24lb per sq inch), which will try to force the two halves apart with a force of 290kN. That's 29 tonnes.Put another way, each bolt that holds the two halves together will take a load of 13.2kN, or 1.3 tonnes.So after parking two average-sized cars on the side of the fin, we could pick each of them up in turn with just one bolt from the intake.That would explain why the bolts cost about £20 each!If that wasn't enough to worry about, the intake has also been designed to withstand an engine "backfire" without collapsing.If the airflow into a jet engine breaks down, the jet can burp back the air it has been ingesting, known in the jet engine world as a "surge". This could briefly push the intake pressure up almost 3 Bar (44 psi), increasing the load on the intake to over 50 tonnes. That's the weight of four double-decker buses.The bad news is that this load would pretty much wreck the intake. The good news is that we're using the Typhoon's EJ200 engine, one of the world's best jet engines.In normal operation it just doesn't ever surge. I can floor the throttle pedal (which controls the jet engine) at a standstill, and the engine will give me as much power as possible, without any risk that it will surge.The intake doesn't have much to worry about - and neither do I.</body>

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24369363</url>
      <date>1381193972</date>
      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <title>Higgs: Five decades of noble endeavour</title>
      <description>Nobel recognises Higgs theory after near-50-year wait</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24445325</url>
      <date>1381271378</date>
      <body>Fifty years is a long time to wait for recognition of a brilliant idea. But this is the burden that Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have had to bear since they first proposed a mechanism to describe how matter in the Universe acquires mass.Englert and fellow Belgian Robert Brout were first to publish their ideas in August 1964. Higgs followed in October.The view - certainly, the one expressed by the Nobel committee on Tuesday - is that their papers were independent and indistinguishable, and that their work should therefore be jointly honoured.Of course, it is the standard practice not to award a Nobel posthumously, and so it is only Higgs and Englert who take the limelight, as their peer in this great endeavour, Robert Brout, died in 2011.Every advance owes something to previous generations - even Newton said he stood on the shoulders of giants; and sometimes it takes the insights of those who follow to truly see the implications.Prof Tom Kibble from Imperial College London probably falls into this latter category. His work with Americans Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen is regarded as being instrumental in the eventual application of the ideas expressed by Higgs, Englert and Brout."As you probably know, there were three groups working on this problem back then, but everyone's work in 1964 received essentially no attention at all, apart from the scepticism of various people," he recalls."The papers had hardly any citations for two or three years."If the Nobel committee's rules permitted more than three recipients per gong then the Imperial man could well have been standing in front of Tuesday's TV lights as well. As it is, he's applauding from the wings and proud to do so."I'm just really pleased they've recognised this work and this field," he told me.Particle physics is not the easiest subject to grasp for the lay audience, but a great many of us have come to absorb a vague concept of what the Higgs field and its associated boson entail - however fumbling.It is this notion that the Universe contains an all-pervasive field that elementary particles - the fundamental building blocks of matter - must traverse; and it is the drag these particles experience as they pass through the field that determines their mass. The boson is the thing that mediates the interactions.The maths may be beyond most of us, but everyone can appreciate that without an adequate description of mass - the very essence of stuff - then the cosmos can make no sense. There would be no form, no substance.The key reason it has taken nearly 50 years to prove the Higgs mechanism is that only now do we have an experimental set-up capable of nailing its existence.Others tried, but it took the scale and energy of the $10bn Large Hadron Collider to find the evidence.This colossal underground machine accelerates clutches of proton particles to fantastic speeds around a ring, colliding them in full view of sensitive detectors positioned at two widely separated locations.Only about one collision in every trillion produces a trace of the Higgs boson, and even then it is a process of deduction because all the scientists actually see are the products into which the particle decays.But the two independent detector sites confirmed each other's observations, and the boson was duly announced to great fanfare in July 2012."It is absolutely apt that it is recognised by a Nobel; it is one of the great discoveries of the 21 Century," says Prof Jim Virdee, another Imperial scientist and former spokesperson for one of those LHC detectors, the CMS experiment."One has to put it in some perspective. Our Standard Model [to describe how the basic building blocks of matter interact] wasn't built in a day. The first particle, the electron, was discovered by Thompson in 1897, and the Higgs is the last particle of the Standard Model - the 17th. So it was an enormous endeavour."Not that this is the end of the story. The LHC has barely got going and other discoveries are virtually guaranteed as it crashes together proton particles at ever greater energies."The LHC is a tremendous development," says Kibble. "We could never have pictured the experimental work that has burgeoned from those theoretical efforts in the 1960s."Which does raise the interesting question of why the LHC itself, its host institution Cern, and the thousands of scientists who work there, could not also be recognised in some form.The Nobel committee's rules for the physics prize do not seem to allow for this, but there is the precedent of another scientific body - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - being given the Nobel peace prize in 2007.Some have speculated that Cern would also be a very worthy recipient of this gong."Cern has as one of its objectives to bring nations together through science," says Prof Virdee."It's certainly a remarkable human achievement to get so many people from so many different countries, cultures and creeds working together in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge. It's very uplifting."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>Syria monitors win Nobel Peace Prize</title>
      <description>The OPCW, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, wins the Nobel Peace Prize.</description>

      <body>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal, has won the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee said it was in honour of the OPCW's "extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons".The OPCW, based in The Hague, was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said the award was a "great honour" and would spur it on in its work.He said the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria had been a "tragic reminder that there remains much work to be done".The OPCW recently sent inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons.It is the first time OPCW inspectors have worked in an active war zone.The watchdog picks up a gold medal and 8m Swedish kronor ($1.25m; £780,000) as winner of the most coveted of the Nobel honours.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the award, saying the OPCW had "greatly strengthened the rule of law in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation".Announcing the award in Oslo, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said it wanted to recognise the OPCW's "extensive work"."The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law," he said."Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons."The OPCW's Ahmet Uzumcu said the organisation had been working "with quiet determination to rid the world of these heinous weapons", away from the spotlight, for the past 16 years.He said the Syria mission was the first time the OPCW had worked to such a short timeframe and in an ongoing conflict, and that it was "conscious of the enormous trust" placed on it by the international community.Praising the commitment of his staff and the support of member states, he said the Nobel Peace Prize would "spur us to untiring effort, even stronger commitment and greater dedication" to bring about a world free of chemical weapons".The head of the OPCW inspection team in Syria, Ake Sellstrom, said: "This is a powerful pat on the back that will strengthen the organisation's work in Syria."The OPCW is made up of 189 member states and the principal role of its 500-strong staff is to monitor and destroy all existing chemical weapons.It draws on a network of some of the best laboratories and scientists in the world to help it in its work, the BBC's science correspondent Pallab Ghosh says.The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention has contributed to the destruction of nearly 80% of the world's chemical weapons stockpile.Syria is expected to sign the treaty in the coming days.French President Francois Hollande said the Nobel prize was a "vindication" of the international efforts in Syria and pledged continued support for the OPCW's work there and elsewhere.US Secretary of State John Kerry said the "Nobel Committee has rightly recognised [the OPCW's] bravery and resolve".European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso, EU President Herman Van Rompuy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel all congratulated the OPCW.There were a record 259 nominees for this year's Peace Prize, but the list remains a secret.Pakistani schoolgirl campaigner Malala Yousafzai and gynaecologist Denis Mukwege of the Democratic Republic of Congo had been tipped as favourites to take the award.Others who had been listed as contenders were Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), the US soldier convicted of giving classified documents to Wikileaks and Maggie Gobran, an Egyptian computer scientist who abandoned her academic career to become a Coptic Christian nun and founded the charity Stephen's Children.But an hour before Friday's announcement, NRK reported the award would go to the OPCW.The European Union won the prize in 2012 in recognition of its contribution to peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.Previous Nobel Peace Prize laureates include anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, US President Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Nobel Committee has in the past publicly regretted never awarding the prize to Mahatma Gandhi, the pacifist leader of the Indian nationalist movement against British rule, even though he was nominated five times.</body>

      <title>Gaddafi top spy to be tried in Libya</title>
      <description>The International Criminal Court has ruled that Libya's Gaddafi-era intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi, can be tried in Libya.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24493885</url>
      <date>1381497985</date>
      <body>The International Criminal Court has ruled that Libya's Gaddafi-era intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi, can be tried in Libya.The decision means that the ICC will no longer demand that Mr Senussi be sent to The Hague to stand trial.The former military intelligence boss was indicted by the ICC in 2011 for war crimes allegedly committed during the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi.Mr Senussi was extradited to Libya from Mauritania last year.The ICC does not carry out proceedings against a suspect if it deems they are receiving a fair trial in a domestic court.A pre-trial chamber at the ICC decided that "Libya is willing and able genuinely to carry out" investigations into Mr Senussi, the court said in a statement.It said the decision had "no bearing on the case against Saif al-Islam Gaddafi".The late leader's son was also indicted by the ICC for war crimes, and is a co-defendant, along with 36 others, of Mr Senussi in the domestic case.The ICC said Libya had failed to show it had collected more than "a few sparse items of evidence" against Mr Gaddafi and had yet to secure him legal representation.A court in Tripoli is to decide on 24 October whether to indict Mr Gaddafi and Mr Senussi, among 20 figures of the former regime charged with the 2011 killings of protesters, Agence France-Presse reported.Saif Gaddafi is being held by a militia in the western town of Zintan. Last month the militiamen refused to deliver him to a court in Tripoli to appear at a pre-trial hearing alongside Mr Senussi and the other defendants in that case.He is facing trial in Zintan on a separate charge of trading information threatening Libya's national security. That case has been adjourned until 12 December.The ICC said its decision not to try Mr Senussi - Col Gaddafi's brother-in-law and said to have been one of his closest aides - could be appealed against if it later decides the trial is unfair.Mr Senussi has been implicated in an infamous Libyan massacre in 1996, in which more than 1,000 inmates were killed at the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli.In 1999 Mr Senussi was tried in absentia in France and sentenced to life imprisonment for the shooting down of a UTA airliner over Niger a decade earlier.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both campaigned for the immediate transfer of Mr Senussi and Mr Gaddafi to the ICC.Amnesty said Libya still needed to improve security and rebuild the country's justice system to ensure fair impartial trials.Libya has been beset by security problems since the 2011 uprising, during which Col Gaddafi was captured and killed while trying to hide from rebels.Earlier this week, the country's prime minister, Ali Zeidan, was kidnapped for several hours by armed militiamen.</body>

      <description>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who was serving a life sentence for his role in a WWII massacre, dies in Italy aged 100, his lawyer says.</description>

      <body>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke has died at the age of 100 in Italy, his lawyer has told Italian media.Priebke was jailed for life in 1998 for his role in the WWII massacre of 335 Italians at Rome's Ardeatine Caves.But because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest in the capital.The move caused anger over what some people in the city regarded as conditions that were far too comfortable and lenient.Priebke was one of the SS officers present during the killing of men and boys at the caves in 1944, in a reprisal attack ordered by Adolf Hitler for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters.He was among the officers who oversaw the operation to round up victims and transport them to a network of caves on the outskirts of the city where they were all shot.Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders.In July, an association representing families of some of the victims of the massacre renewed calls for Priebke to "find the courage to ask for forgiveness".He was extradited to Italy in 1994 after he was discovered working as a school teacher in Argentina.He was tracked down by an American journalist working for ABC News and admitted in an interview his role in the massacre.Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said on Friday that he had left a final video interview as his "human and political testament", but it was unclear what it contained and when it would be released.Priebke, who had been living in his lawyer's apartment in Rome, was allowed to do his own shopping, go for walks in the park and go out to restaurants in the evening to eat with friends.</body>

      <description>At least 12 migrants drown and some 116 are rescued after their boat capsizes off Egypt's coast near Alexandria, security officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 12 migrants have drowned and some 116 were rescued after their boat capsized near the Egyptian port of Alexandria, security officials said.The boat sank early on Friday. The survivors, mostly Palestinians and Syrians, were taken to a naval base.The incident comes a week after at least 311 migrants died when their boat sank off an Italian island.Only 155 people survived the disaster near Lampedusa - divers are still searching for bodies there.Alexandria's security chief, Amin Ezzeddin, told the BBC that the survivors of the latest incident included 40 Syrians, 72 Palestinians and four Egyptians.They were initially taken to a naval base in the Alexandria district of Ras al-Tin and then to a police station.The accident follows another capsizing understood to have happened 10 days ago, also involving Syrians and Palestinians off the coast of Alexandria.More than 3,400 refugees have attempted to make an illegal crossing from Egypt over to Europe since August this year, according to the UNHCR.Many are Syrian and Palestinians escaping conflict in their countries.The Lampedusa incident, in which the boat caught fire and capsized less than 1km (half a mile) from the island's shore has prompted an EU pledge 30m euros ($40m; £25m) to help refugees in Italy.On Thursday the European Union also voted to launch a maritime surveillance system aimed at preventing further migrant disasters.Ministers say the 35m-euros Eurosur programme, which includes plans to share data and use surveillance drones, should speed up the EU response to boats packed with migrants heading for Europe.But opponents insist the bloc needs to provide safer ways for genuine refugees to enter Europe. They say the money would be better spent on increasing physical rescue capabilities.</body>

      <title>Syria rebels 'executed civilians'</title>
      <description>Rebels in Syria killed as many as 190 civilians and seized more than 200 hostages during a military offensive in August, Human Rights Watch says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24486627</url>

      <body>Rebel forces in Syria killed as many as 190 civilians and seized more than 200 hostages during a military offensive in August, Human Rights Watch says.A report by the US-based group says the deaths occurred in villages inhabited predominantly by members of President Bashar al-Assad's minority Alawite sect near the coastal city of Latakia.It said the findings "strongly suggest" crimes against humanity were committed.The group has previously documented atrocities by pro-government forces.The report calls on the UN to impose an arms embargo on all groups where there is credible evidence of their involvement in war crimes.Human Rights Watch says it conducted an on-site investigation in September and interviewed more than 30 people, including survivors and combatants on both sides.Its 105-page report says that in the early hours of 4 August fighters from several different rebel groups attacked and overran army positions in the Sheikh Nabhan area of the Latakia countryside. A soldier told HRW that about 30 of his comrades were killed in the assault.The rebels then entered the Alawite villages of Barouda, Nbeiteh, al-Hamboushieh, Blouta, Abu Makkeh, Beyt Shakouhi, Aramo, Bremseh, Esterbeh, Obeen, and Kharata."Eight survivors and witnesses described how opposition forces executed residents and opened fire on civilians, sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack, and at other times killing adult male family members, and holding the female relatives and children hostage," the report says.The report names 190 civilians killed by the rebels, including at least 57 women, 18 children and 14 elderly men. The total number of dead is likely higher because many residents remained missing and bodies were buried in mass graves, it adds.Opposition sources say the women and children taken hostage in the attack are still being held. Relatives said many appeared in the background of a video published online.HRW says about 20 opposition groups took part in the offensive and that five were involved in the attacks on civilians - the al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), Jaysh al-Muhajirin wa al-Ansar, Ahrar al-Sham and Suqour al-Izz.None are affiliated to the Western-backed Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army, though SMC chief Gen Salim Idris did say at the time that fighters under his command participated in the assault.The report says ISIS and Jaysh al-Muhajirin are holding the hostages.The government launched an offensive to retake the Sheikh Nabhan area on 5 August, ultimately regaining full control on 18 August.Joe Stork, acting Middle East director at HRW, said the abuses were "not the actions of rogue fighters"."This operation was a co-ordinated, planned attack on the civilian population in these Alawite villages," he said.The report says evidence including witness statements and a review of hospital records showed rebels executed or unlawfully killed at least 67 of the 190 dead civilians who were identified. For the remainder, further investigations are required.A doctor at a hospital in Latakia said several of the bodies had multiple gunshot wounds, stab wounds or had been decapitated. Some were burnt or had their feet bound, he added.The report says the high civilian death toll and the nature of the recorded wounds "indicate that opposition forces either intentionally or indiscriminately killed most of the remaining victims"."The evidence strongly suggests that the killings, hostage taking, and other abuses committed by opposition forces on and after August 4 rise to the level of crimes against humanity."HRW says Islamist rebel groups - which include foreign fighters - are financed by individuals in Kuwait and the Gulf. It calls on the UN to impose an arms embargo on all groups credibly accused of war crimes.The organisation has also accused Syrian government forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country's 31-month long conflict, most recently in a chemical weapons attack in several suburbs of the capital, Damascus, on 21 August.Western nations blamed government forces for the attack, in which hundreds died, but President Assad said rebel fighters were responsible.Experts from the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), are currently overseeing efforts to destroy weapons production equipment in Syria.Earlier this year, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, called on the UN Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC).She said it "would send a clear message to both the government and the opposition that there will be consequences for their actions".More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN.</body>

      <title>Latest US debt crisis talks 'useful'</title>
      <description>US Republicans and the White House say latest talks to avert a looming debt crisis were useful, but they break up without agreement.</description>

      <body>Republicans in the US House of Representatives and President Barack Obama have met amid efforts to avert a looming debt crisis.Both sides said the 90-minute discussion was useful but no decision was made. They agreed to keep talking.Republicans have offered the president a short-term debt limit increase to stave off default.A new survey suggests the majority of Americans blame the Republicans for the partial shutdown of government.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests 53% of Americans fault Republicans for the crisis, compared with 31% who say the Democrats are responsible."It was a very adult conversation," said Republican Hal Rogers of Thursday afternoon's meeting. "Both sides said they were there in good faith."House Majority leader Eric Cantor called the meeting "very useful" and said the talks were continuing.Mr Obama planned a late Friday morning White House meeting with Republican senators, who said they would present options of their own for ending the budget standoff.Officials have warned the US risks default on 17 October if the nation's $16.7 trillion (£10.5 trillion) borrowing limit is not increased.Republicans have offered to extend the government's borrowing authority beyond the deadline, temporarily putting off a default.In return they want Mr Obama to negotiate on the budget dispute that has partially closed the government - the first such shutdown for 17 years.Earlier, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said: "It's time for leadership. It's time for these negotiations and this conversation to begin."A spokesman for Mr Boehner told reporters the deal offered was a "clean" increase of the debt limit, with no additional policies attached, lasting six weeks - until 22 November.But it is not clear if Republicans are willing to drop entirely their attempts to defund or delay Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare law.Reacting to the offer, White House press secretary Jay Carney told a daily press briefing the president was glad that "cooler heads" seemed to be prevailing in the House.But he added: "He will not pay ransom in exchange for the Republicans in the House doing their job."Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the Senate would "look at anything" the House sent to them, but they would not engage in negotiations with Republicans prior to reopening the government.Rattled US stock markets rebounded on Thursday on news of a possible breakthrough.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been out of work since the shutdown began, and private firms, from arms makers to motels, have begun to lay off workers.About 15,000 private-sector employees have filed for unemployment benefits due to the shutdown, the US labour department said on Thursday.And governors in at least four western states - Utah, South Dakota, Arizona and Colorado - have asked for authority to reopen national parks within their borders because of the economic impact of the closures.On Thursday, Mr Obama signed legislation restoring death benefits to families of US troops who have died since the government closed. The shutdown prevented processing of the payments, typically made within days of the soldier's death.The president met House Democrats at the White House on Wednesday and told them he would prefer a longer-term increase to the nation's debt ceiling, but was willing to accept a short-term fix.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told a Senate hearing that skipping a payment on US debt would trigger financial crisis"chaos".Since the US hit its debt ceiling in May, the treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, Mr Lew has said.</body>

      <title>Racing driver De Villota found dead</title>
      <description>Formula 1 reserve driver Maria De Villota is found dead in a hotel room in the Spanish city of Seville.</description>

      <body>Formula 1 reserve racing driver Maria De Villota has been found dead in a hotel room in Seville, Spain.A police spokeswoman said: "We are assuming it was a natural death, but we cannot confirm anything."Spaniard De Villota, 33, lost her right eye in a crash last July while testing for the Marussia team.She suffered severe head and facial injuries after colliding with a lorry at Duxford Aerodrome,  Cambridgeshire, but had been cleared to resume driving.De Villota, who had been in motor-racing for 12 years, had previously competed in Spanish Formula 3 and the Daytona 24 Hours race in the United States.Her dream of driving a Formula 1 car came two years ago when she tested a Renault.A family statement read: "Dear friends: Maria is gone. She had to go to heaven with all of the angels."De Villota, daughter of ex-Formula 1 driver Emilio, was reported to have been in Seville to launch her autobiography.The police spokeswoman said De Villota's body was found at around 07:00 (06:00 BST) at the Hotel Sevilla Congresos in the southern Spanish city.Forensic scientists and officers from the homicide unit were due to examine the scene.F1 teams and drivers have expressed their shock at the news of her death.Spaniard Fernando Alonso, the Ferrari driver, said: "Today is a very sad day for Spanish sport. We have lost a fighter with a huge smile."Britain's Jenson Button added: "It's horrendous news. Very tragic, the girl has been through so much, more than most people go through in their lives. It has been tough for her but this is horrific news and a real shock to the whole paddock and the world of motorsport."We saw her this year in Barcelona. We were doing some work for a children's charity and she was the first one to put her hand up to do it, and got a lot of other drivers involved - she was doing a lot for the community."Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, who worked alongside De Villota as an ambassador for the Women in Motorsport commission,  told BBC Radio 5 live: "I had so much respect for the courage she had and how she fought against all the odds and I'll always remember her having a smile, no matter what happened."After the accident everybody else would have thought she doesn't really want to have anything to do with motorsport."But no - there she was, texting away and saying she wants to be back as soon as possible."It didn't take her any time at all until she was back; she was planning maybe even to drive but more important to her was to give other people the courage that you can still do so much even if you've had such a major setback."Last year, De Villota spoke movingly about the initial recovery stages following her accident and recalled: "The surgeon came up to me with my family around him and said: 'Maria, we have saved your life, I don't know if you remember you had a serious accident but we have to tell you that you have lost your eye'."I asked him: 'Are you a surgeon? Do you need both hands to operate? I am a Formula 1 driver and I need both eyes to drive."Before, I only saw F1, I saw myself in a car competing. I did not see what was important in life, the clarity to say: 'I am alive'."It has given me my bearings, given me back what's important. I accept it with the energy to say I am going to live out this chance 100%."Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team boss and president of the Formula 1 Teams' Association (Fota), said F1 would discuss what would be the appropriate way to mark De Villota's death over the Japanese Grand Prix weekend but that it was not a simple decision."We will be talking amongst ourselves," he said told BBC Sport. "You have to be careful; a lot of racers don't want these issues to detract from a race weekend."Everyone wants to demonstrate the right level of sympathy but the real racers would want the show to go on and wouldn't want a fuss to be made. It's not something we need to amplify, it's something we've got to be sensitive about."</body>

      <title>African Union condemns 'unfair' ICC</title>
      <description>The International Criminal Court is treating Africa unfairly, a senior African Union official says at the start of a special AU meeting to discuss a possible pull-out.</description>

      <date>1381493274</date>
      <body>The International Criminal Court is treating Africa unfairly, a senior African Union official has said, at the start of a special AU meeting to discuss a possible pull-out.Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the court was targeting Africa and Africans.The two-day summit comes as Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is due to face trial at The Hague next month.He denies charges of organising violence after the 2007 elections.On Thursday, Mr Kenyatta again asked for the charges to be dismissed.He, along with some other African leaders, argue that a serving president should not be made to face trial.The ICC has rejected a previous request that he be allowed to give evidence by video link.His deputy, William Ruto, faces similar charges, which he also denies.His trial was postponed for a week last month to allow him to return home to help deal with the terror attack on the Westgate shopping centre.Mr Tedros, who is the current chairman of the AU's Executive Council, said the ICC was "condescending" towards the continent."Far from promoting justice and reconciliation... the court has transformed itself into a political instrument targeting Africa and Africans. This unfair and unjust treatment is totally unacceptable," he said.He said that the ICC had failed to respond to the African Union's previous complaints and said the issue should be referred to the UN Security Council.Kenya's foreign minister has denied initial reports that it is lobbying for the African Union to call for all member states to withdraw from the ICC.Analysts say several East African nations favour such a move, while there is less support in West Africa.Botswana has also publicly supported the court, while South Africa's governing African National Congress has voiced criticism.Thirty-four of the AU's 54 members have signed up to the ICC.If a large number of the 34 African countries were to pull out, it would be a huge blow to the ICC, which has 122 members.Kenya's parliament has already passed a motion for the country to withdraw.Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that withdrawing from the court would be a "badge of shame".Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu has also voiced his support for the ICC."Those leaders seeking to skirt the court are effectively looking for a license to kill, maim and oppress their own people without consequence. They believe the interests of the people should not stand in the way of their ambitions of wealth and power," he wrote in an article carried by several newspapers."They simply vilify the institution as racist and unjust, as Hermann Goering and his fellow Nazi defendants vilified the Nuremberg tribunals following World War II," he wrote.All eight of the cases currently open at the ICC are in Africa but it is also investigating possible cases elsewhere.</body>

      <title>UN urges Iraq to halt executions</title>
      <description>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urges Iraq to halt all executions, calling the deaths of 42 people this week "obscene and inhumane".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24493841</url>
      <date>1381492402</date>
      <body>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called on Iraq to halt all executions and commute the sentences of hundreds of people sentenced to death.A spokesman for Navi Pillay said the executions on Tuesday and Wednesday of 42 people convicted of terrorism charges was "obscene and inhumane".The claim that the death penalty helped deter terrorism was a "fallacy", given the surging violence in Iraq, he added.The number of people executed in Iraq rose from 18 in 2010 to 123 in 2012.So far this year, the authorities have carried out 140 executions, according to figures compiled by the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.Ms Pillay's spokesman, Rupert Colville, said in a statement that large-scale executions of the sort reported by the Iraqi ministry of justice on Thursday "are not only obscene and inhumane, they are most probably in contravention of international law"."They are also undermining efforts to build a more stable, less violent society in Iraq. The mass execution carried out over the past two days is particularly perverse given that yesterday was World Day Against the Death Penalty," he added.The Iraqi government maintains that it only executes individuals who have committed terrorist acts or other serious crimes against civilians."In our view, the claim that using the death penalty can help deter terrorism is clearly exposed as a fallacy, given the soaring casualty rate in Iraq, which has occurred over roughly the same period as the dramatic and shocking increase in the use of the death penalty," Mr Colville said.The UN has said that 5,740 civilians have been killed in Iraq since January - almost double the figure it reported for the whole of 2010.</body>

      <title>Kerry in Afghanistan for key talks</title>

      <date>1381503490</date>
      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has begun talks in Afghanistan, which are expected to focus on a stalled security agreement between the two nations.Mr Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai are discussing the deal which would allow the presence of US troops after the 2014 Nato troop withdrawal.But disagreements remain over key issues, including how much the US would defend Afghanistan if it is attacked.Mr Karzai has accused Nato of failing to bring stability to Afghanistan."On the security front the entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure," he told the BBC Newsnight earlier this week.Mr Kerry began talks with his Afghan counterpart shortly after arriving on an unannounced visit to Kabul on Friday.Washington wants the deal done before Afghanistan's presidential election campaign opens next month."(US) President (Barack) Obama and President Karzai reaffirmed both back in January that the goal here was to complete the BSA (Bilateral Security Agreement) in October," a US state department official travelling with Mr Kerry was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency."Uncertainty about an incomplete BSA could erode the resolve among Nato allies, makes (it) more difficult to plan for the US," the official said.But there is deadlock over how much the US would defend Afghanistan if it is attacked, with Washington not wanting to be committed to defending the mountain passes of the east against infiltration from Pakistan.Meanwhile, Kabul wants an end to raids on its soil and is demanding that the US hand over intelligence instead.During his visit Mr Kerry will hope to bridge what looks like a wide gap between the two sides, the BBC's Afghanistan correspondent David Loyn reports.But he adds that US officials are now talking about the possibility of a "zero option" - no troops in Afghanistan after the end of 2014.Mr Karzai told the BBC's Newsnight this week that he was in no hurry to sign a pact."If the agreement doesn't suit us then of course they can leave. The agreement has to suit Afghanistan's interests and purposes. If it doesn't suit us and if it doesn't suit them then naturally we will go separate ways."He also claimed that Nato had incorrectly focused the fight on Afghan villages rather than Taliban safe havens in Pakistan.Mr Karzai has had troubled relations with his Western backers in recent years for openly criticising Nato, whom he has accused of having no respect for Afghan sovereignty.He is concerned about his legacy, not wanting to be remembered for losing Afghan sovereignty, our correspondent adds.</body>

      <title>Coroner denies Ohio captor sex death</title>
      <description>A coroner says there were no signs auto-erotic asphyxiation played in a role in the hanging of Ohio captor, Ariel Castro.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24487839</url>
      <date>1381485849</date>
      <body>The coroner who classified the death of Ohio captor Ariel Castro as a suicide says there were no signs he had been choking himself for sexual pleasure.It follows a state prison report that suggested his death by hanging last month may not have been suicide.It said he was found partially naked in his cell and hinted at accidental death by auto-erotic asphyxiation.Castro was beginning a life sentence for imprisoning, raping and torturing three women in his home for ten years.Details of his death were published by the Ohio Department for Rehabilitation and Correction on Thursday.According to the findings, Castro was found "hanging from a hinge in the window of his cell by a sheet wrapped around his neck. His pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles".The convict left no suicide note.The report said Castro's intentions were unclear, however the facts had been "relayed to the Ohio State Highway Patrol for consideration of the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation" - the act of restricting air supply for sexual pleasure.But Franklin County coroner Jan Gorniak said there were no signs Castro had been sexually stimulated, speaking in a statement to media on Thursday."That's why I called it a hanging suicide," she is quoted as saying by the Plain Dealer newspaper.She suggested his trousers and underwear may have simply fallen down while he was hanging and was not enough evidence to back up the idea of auto-erotic asphyxiation.Ms Gorniak said she had not been consulted by anyone involved in the report over the possible cause of death.The report also found that prison guards had faked logs about their monitoring of Ariel Castro in the hours before he killed himself.Officials found video footage indicating that two guards failed to make checks at least eight times on that day.Castro was supposed to have been checked by guards in his isolation cell in Orient, Ohio, every 30 minutes.The 53-year-old was taken off suicide watch in June after authorities determined he was not at risk of taking his own life.His lawyer, Craig Weintraub, told reporters last month that Castro had been denied permission to receive independent counselling despite previously contemplating suicide and that he was likely to suffer depression after his sentence.The former school bus driver was sentenced in August to life imprisonment without parole plus 1,000 years for the abduction of Michelle Knight, 32, Amanda Berry, 27, and Gina DeJesus, 23, from the Cleveland streets between 2002-04.The three women escaped from Castro's home on 6 May.In an interview soon after his conviction, Castro's lawyers said that he fit the profile of someone with a sociopathic disorder.</body>

      <body>Spain's top criminal court has decided to hear a case brought by Tibetan rights activists who allege that China's former President Hu Jintao committed genocide in Tibet.Judges ruled that they were competent to handle the case because one of the activists, Tibetan monk Thubten Wangchen, is a Spanish citizen.Hu Jintao was the Communist Party leader in Tibet in 1988-1992, when Chinese troops quelled mass protests.China imposed martial law in Tibet.The remote mountainous territory is an autonomous region ruled by Beijing.In their lawsuit against Hu Jintao the Madrid-based Tibetan Support Committee allege that as Communist leader in the region he was ultimately responsible for actions "aimed at eliminating the uniqueness and existence of Tibet as a country, imposing martial law, carrying out forced deportations, mass sterilisation campaigns, torture of dissidents".The Spanish legal system recognises the universal justice principle, under which genocide suspects can be put on trial outside their home country. But for Spain to hold the trial there is a requirement that at least one victim of alleged genocide must be a Spanish citizen.Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over Tibet, but many Tibetans remain loyal to the exiled Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. He is seen by his followers as a living god, but by China as a separatist threat.Genocide, the gravest crime against humanity, is understood to mean actions aimed at the mass extermination of a whole group of people.</body>

      <title>Living Ohio man ruled 'legally dead'</title>

      <body>A US man declared dead after he disappeared nearly three decades ago cannot now be declared officially alive, though he has returned home and is in good health, a judge has ruled.Donald Miller of Ohio left behind a wife, two children and significant debt when he fled his home in 1986.He was declared legally dead in 1994, then re-emerged in 2005 and attempted to apply for a driving licence.A judge this week found death rulings cannot be overturned after three years.Judge Allan Davis handed down the ruling in Hancock County, Ohio, probate court on Monday, calling it a "strange, strange situation", according to media reports."We've got the obvious here. A man sitting in the courtroom, he appears to be in good health,'' he said, finding that he was prevented by state law from declaring Mr Miller legally alive."I don't know where that leaves you, but you're still deceased as far as the law is concerned."Mr Miller, 61, testified that he fled his home in 1986 after he lost his job, leaving behind his wife, Robin, and two children.By 1994, Mr Miller's back child support payments amounted to more than $25,000 (£15,646) and the family had heard no word from him.With Mr Miller declared dead, his "widow" was entitled to Social Security death benefits to support their children.As Mr Miller remains legally deceased, Ms Miller does not have to return those funds to the government.It remains unclear if she would have been able to collect back child support had he been declared living.Ms Miller's lawyer said his client was "satisfied" with the ruling on Thursday, and did not harbour ill will toward her ex-husband.Mr Miller's "death" came as a surprise to him when he re-emerged in 2005. He was later told of the matter by his parents."It kind of went further than I ever expected it to," Mr Miller told the media. "I just kind of took off, ended up in different places."Mr Miller has 30 days to appeal against the Ohio court's ruling, and may be able to challenge the US Social Security Administration in federal court, according to media reports.</body>

      <body>Hit US TV series Glee has paid tribute to cast member Cory Monteith, who died in July, in a special episode entitled The Quarterback.Monteith, who died of a drug overdose, played high school football star Finn.Set three weeks after Finn's funeral, the show made no mention of the character's cause of death, but focused on how his friends cope with the grief.Kevin Fallon, writing in The Daily Beast, called it "classy, cathartic, heartbreaking, and a gorgeous homage"."Endless credit... is due to the team that orchestrated The Quarterback, because admirable restraint was shown in not milking a cautionary tale out of Monteith's unhappily ever after," he wrote.But the Washington Post's Hank Stuever disagreed: "It was disappointing to see them [the writers] set aside one of Glee's lasting attributes - cold honesty - as it awkwardly and even sanguinely avoided revealing how Monteith's character died."It came across as a bizarre absence of basic plot in a show that built its reputation on deftly locating comedy in the most uncomfortable personal details."The episode showed characters including Kurt, Puck, Santana and Sue Sylvester dealing with their grief in a variety of ways - although Quinn - a previous onscreen girlfriend, was notably absent."Perhaps it is best to think of Thursday's broadcast as a labour of love, and to presume it worked best for those who are most devoted to the show and its often heady blend of musical flash, after-school-special preachiness and high-and-low humour," wrote Robert Bianco in USA Today."It's almost impossible to do a story about the death of a teenager that doesn't induce tears, particularly when the plot is tied into the real-life loss of a well-liked young actor. One just wishes the writers had put a bit more trust into that natural response, and not tugged at our heartstrings quite so strenuously," he continued.The final act saw Monteith's real-life fiancee, and onscreen girlfriend, Lea Michele, perform Make You Feel My Love, which Fallon called "a testament to her own strength".Monteith had been on the show - about a group of high school misfits who form a singing club - since it began in 2009. The Emmy award-winning show is now it its fifth seriesThe Canadian actor, 31, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room.Last week, a coroner's report concluded that he had died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol. Monteith had previously talked frankly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager.</body>

      <body>Scott Carpenter, one of the original members of the Mercury 7 - Nasa's first group of astronauts - has died aged 88, his family has announced.In 1962 Mr Carpenter became the second American to orbit the earth, piloting the Aurora 7 spacecraft through three revolutions of the earth.After retiring in 1969 he took up oceanographic activities.John Glenn, who flew the first orbital mission, is the last surviving member of the Mercury team.Scott Carpenter's wife, Patty Barrett, said her husband had suffered complications following a stroke in September and died in a Denver hospice.He lived in Vail, Colorado.Mr Carpenter, who was born in Boulder, Colorado, was commissioned in the US Navy in 1949 and served as a pilot during the Korean War.In April 1959 he was selected as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts and underwent training with Nasa, specialising in communication and navigation.He was the backup pilot for John Glenn during preparation for the first US manned orbital space flight in February 1962, and gave the historic send-off to his teammate: "Godspeed, John Glenn.''During his own flight, Scott Carpenter's capsule landed 288 miles away from where it was meant to, leaving Nasa and the nation waiting anxiously to see if he had survived.The Navy recovered him from the Caribbean, floating in his life-raft with his feet propped up.In a joint lecture with John Glenn 49 years later at the Smithsonian Institution, Mr Carpenter recalled his feelings from that time."You're looking out at a totally black sky, seeing an altimeter reading of 90,000ft and realise you are going straight up. And the thought crossed my mind: What am I doing?''Scott Carpenter did not go back into space but later joined the US Navy's SeaLab II programme and in 1965 spent 30 days under the ocean off the coast of California.After retirement he founded his company Sea Sciences, working closely with diver and researcher Jacques Cousteau.</body>

      <body>Thirteen inmates have been killed and at least 30 injured in a fight between rival gangs in a prison in Brazil.Riot police say they have regained control of Pedrinhas prison in Sao Luis, in the state of Maranhao, and are searching the jail for illegal weapons.Prison guards said fighting had broken out after they discovered inmates digging an escape tunnel.Brazilian prisons suffer from extreme overcrowding and riots and gang warfare are not unusual.The riot started after guards received a tip-off that 60 inmates were digging a tunnel through which they were planning to escape at dawn, Maranhao state security secretary Aluisio Mendes said."When the guards tried to access the cell in which the entrance to the tunnel was located, the prisoners tried to fight them off," he added.Prisoners started a fire and members of rival gangs took advantage of the confusion to settle scores, officials said.Relatives of inmates gathered outside the prison complex demanding information and threw stones at the guards.Several buses were also set alight by the relatives, local media reported.Pedrinhas is notorious for its gang warfare. Earlier this month, three inmates were killed, one of them decapitated.Another was electrocuted when he got entangled in cables used to light an escape tunnel last month.Brazil's Minister of Justice, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, said last year that Brazil had "a medieval prison system, which not only violates human rights [but] does not allow for the most important element of a penal sanction, which is social reintegration".Officials say that despite building new prisons they have not been able to keep pace with the increasing number of detainees, making it hard for them to improve conditions within the jails.</body>

      <title>UN sued over Haiti cholera epidemic</title>
      <description>The UN faces a claim for compensation by victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti, which victims' lawyers say was caused by peacekeepers.</description>

      <body>Lawyers representing victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti have filed a lawsuit against the United Nations at a court in New York.They say UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010. The disease killed more than 8,000 people and made hundreds of thousands sick.The lawyers are demanding compensation of $100,000 (£62,000) for every person who died and $50,000 for each of those who became ill.The UN says it has legal immunity.Lawyers filed the suit at the US District Court in New York. They said they were left with no other option after the UN had rejected previous claims for compensation."The UN refused to even consider them. We then felt we had no choice but to file in a national court," Brian Concannon, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which is bringing the case, told the BBC.BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle says investigations have pointed strongly to leaking sewage at a camp for UN soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, as the origin of the outbreak in Haiti.No cases of the bacterial infection, which causes diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramps, had been recorded in Haiti for a century until the outbreak in late 2010.Then cases mounted quickly in an area near the camp.Leading cholera expert Danielle Lantagne, who once worked for the UN, said in the past that the outbreak's "most likely source" was the UN camp.In February, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the petition for compensation was "not receivable" under a 1947 convention which grants the UN immunity for its actions.Our correspondent says the UN's position is unlikely to change.</body>

      <description>Mozambique expels the Portuguese football coach of one of its biggest teams after he called Mozambicans "a bunch of thieves".</description>

      <date>1381493729</date>
      <body>Mozambique's Labour Minister Helena Taipo has expelled a Portuguese football coach for insulting the country, a former colony of Portugal.Diamantino Miranda, the coach of the Costa do Sol club in the capital, Maputo, must leave by Saturday.Last month, he was recorded saying that Mozambicans were "a bunch of thieves" after he disputed a refereeing decision.He has apologised and cried at a press conference announcing his expulsion.The coach said he did not realise at first when making the comments that he was talking to a journalist - and that his words had been recorded.In an emotional speech at a press conference called by Costa do Sol, one of the country's biggest teams, he said that he held the Mozambican people close to his heart."I hope that the truth will be restored and that one day I will return to Mozambique," Portugal's Publico newspaper quoted him as saying.Mr Miranda's remarks were made after Costa do Sol lost 1-2 to Vilanculos last month."All here are thieves. You are all a bunch of thieves, you and other journalists can be bought off with a bowl of soup. This country is not serious," he was recorded as saying.Costa do Sol's management said they disagreed with the expulsion and felt it unfair.The club received Ms Taipo's expulsion letter on Thursday, which gave Mr Miranda 48 hours to leave the country.Her letter said he showed "a lack of respect, civility and consideration of the values enshrined in the constitution of the republic as well as legislation in force in our country", Mozambique's O Pais newspaper reports.Some 250,000 Portuguese left Mozambique after independence in 1975, but many are now seeking employment opportunities in the former colony, which has one of the world's fastest-growing economies, in contrast to Portugal.</body>

      <date>1381448247</date>
      <body>African elephants have demonstrated what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.In a series of tests, researcher Ann Smet, of the University of St Andrews, offered the animals a choice between two identical buckets, then pointed at the one containing a hidden treat.From the first trial, the elephants chose the correct bucket.The results are published in the journal Current Biology.The scientists worked with captive elephants at a lodge in Zimbabwe.Prof Richard Byrne, a co-author on the research, said the elephants had been rescued from culling operations and trained for riding."They specifically train the elephants to respond to vocal cues. They don't use any gestures at all," said Prof Byrne."The idea is that the handler can walk behind the elephant and just tell it what to do with words."Despite this, the animals seemed to grasp the meaning of pointing from the outset. This makes them the only non-human animals to understand the gesture without being trained to do so.In previous studies, Prof Byrne said, our closest primate cousins, the chimpanzees, proved to be "hopeless" at at similar task.Ms Smet added that she had been impressed by the animals' apparently innate understanding of the gesture."Of course we had hoped that the elephants would be able to learn to follow human pointing, or we wouldn't have done the experiment in the first place," she said."But it was really surprising that they didn't seem to have to learn anything."It seems that understanding pointing is an ability elephants just possess naturally and they are cognitively much more like us than has been realised."Prof Byrne said studying elephants helped build a map of part of the evolutionary tree that is very distant from humans."They're so unrelated to us," he told BBC News. "So if we find human-like abilities in an animal like an elephant, that hasn't shared a common ancestor with people for more than 100 million years , we can be pretty sure that it's evolved completely separately, by what's called convergent evolution."The researchers said their findings might explain how elephants have successfully been tamed and have "historically had a close bond with humans, in spite of being potentially dangerous and unmanageable due to their great size".But the scientists added the results could be a hint that the animals gesture to one another in the wild with their "highly controllable trunks".Ms Smet told BBC News: "The next step [in our research] is to test whether when an elephant extends its trunk upwards and outwards - as they regularly do, such as when detecting a predator, this functions as a point."</body>

      <body>India is preparing for a massive cyclone, which is sweeping through the Bay of Bengal towards the east coast.Cyclone Phailin, categorised as "very severe" by weather forecasters, is expected to hit Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states on Saturday.The Meteorological Department has predicted the storm will bring winds of 205-215 km/h (127-134 mph) when it makes landfall.A deadly super-cyclone in 1999 killed more than 10,000 people in Orissa.The army is on standby in the two states for emergency and relief operations.Officials said helicopters and food packages were ready to be dropped in the storm-affected areas.Meteorologists say that the storm is not only intense but covers a wide area.Fishermen have been asked not to venture out to sea.Rain and winds are already being felt in Orissa, where authorities said they were setting up shelters for people who would need to be evacuated."We are fighting against nature. We are better prepared this time, we learnt a lot from 1999," Orissa's Disaster Management Minister Surya Narayan Patra told the NDTV news channel.Reports said that there had been panic buying in the state capital, Bhubaneswar, with shelves being emptied of food."I'm feeling scared and tense. My son is expected to arrive Sunday. Now I think he won't make it," housewife Manjushree Das told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency.The evacuation of about 64,000 people from low-lying areas of vulnerable districts in Andhra Pradesh has also begun, AFP reports.India's eastern coast and Bangladesh are routinely hit by cyclonic storms between April and November which cause deaths and widespread damage to property.In December 2011, Cyclone Thane hit the southern state of Tamil Nadu, killing dozens of people.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>The mother of a US citizen imprisoned in North Korea is being allowed to visit him, his family says.Terri Chung, the sister of Kenneth Bae, said their mother was in Pyongyang and due to meet him on Friday morning.Mr Bae, a Korean-American, was arrested last November and sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May.North Korea said that Mr Bae - described as both a tour operator and Christian missionary - had used his tourism business to plot sedition.In a video statement made prior to her departure, Myunghee Bae said she expected to be in North Korea for five days."I don't really know what to expect for my trip. All I know is that I want to see my son," she said.She said she was grateful to the North Korean authorities for allowing her to visit and expressed shock at the appearance of her son in an interview from prison on 3 July."He looked so different and he lost so much weight. I could not believe that prisoner was my son," she said.Mr Bae's family say his health has deteriorated in recent months and he is suffering from diabetes, an enlarged heart and back pain.Two months ago, he was transferred from a prison camp to a hospital, they said.Kenneth Bae (known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho) was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China.His trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test on 13 February.It also came as the US and South Korea conducted annual large-scale military exercises, which angered Pyongyang.Tensions have since eased somewhat. In August, North Korea issued and then revoked an invitation for US envoy Robert King to travel to Pyongyang to seek Mr Bae's release.North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytising.They were released after visits to Pyongyang by high-profile officials, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.The US accuses North Korea of using detained citizens as bargaining chips.</body>

      <title>Pope to discuss German bishop row</title>

      <body>The head of the Catholic Church in Germany is to raise with Pope Francis a row over a bishop accused of lavish spending and lying under oath.Archbishop Robert Zollitsch said he would meet the pontiff next week to discuss the Bishop of Limburg, Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst.German prosecutors want to fine the bishop for making false affidavits. The bishop has made no immediate comment.Pope Francis has preached frugality since taking office in March.The bishop's name has been plastered across German newspapers all week, the Germany's international broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.There were calls for his resignation after it emerged that the cost of his new residence in Limburg, a town in Hesse near Frankfurt-on-Main, had run to 31m euros (£26m; $42m), more than six times the original estimate.Then, on Thursday, state prosecutors in Hamburg said the bishop had twice lied under oath about a flight he took to India on a trip to visit poor children.He had filed a civil court claim against Der Spiegel magazine, which is based in the northern city, for reporting that he had flown first class on the trip.After being forced to print a retraction, the magazine filed a legal complaint of its own. As evidence, it published mobile phone video (clip in German) of its interview with Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, in which he clearly stated that he had flown business class.Asked by the German daily Bild about the high cost of his new residence, the bishop said: "I understand that the high cost of 31m euros sounds frightening. Those who know me know that I don't have a pompous lifestyle."Archbishop Zollitsch said he had set up a commission to investigate the finances of Limburg diocese."I'm not entitled to judge the request of the Hamburg state prosecutors or the Bishop of Limburg," he told reporters."I am sure that the bishop is dealing with this development thoroughly and with the necessary self-criticism".He said he would "speak to the Holy Father and the relevant people" about the issue in Rome next week.German Catholics pay a hefty compulsory tax to the Church, as part of their income tax, the BBC's Damien McGuinness reports from Berlin.Many are shocked by the allegations of financial waste, which would go against the Pope's aspiration for Church leaders to live simply and modestly, our correspondent says.</body>

      <body>A car bomb has exploded outside the Swedish consulate in Libya's second largest city of Benghazi, with no reported casualties, officials say.The front of the building and nearby houses were damaged in the attack in the upscale district of Fuwayhat.The Swedish mission - one of the few diplomatic offices in Benghazi - was empty during the attack.It is the latest in a series of attacks on foreign embassies as Libya struggles to deal with lawlessness since 2011.The car bomb was detonated by remote control on Friday, according to officials.No staff were injured in the attack as the embassy is usually closed on Fridays, says Swedish foreign ministry spokesman Ursula Ahlen.It comes a day after Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was seized from a Tripoli hotel and briefly held by armed militiamen for undisclosed reasons.Earlier this month, staff from the Russian embassy were evacuated after gunmen attacked its compound in Tripoli.A car bomb was also found outside the Italian embassy in June and the UK withdrew some embassy staff in May over security concerns.The most serious incident occurred last year, when US ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, alongside three other US officials.</body>

      <body>Israeli forces have detained five Palestinians after an Israeli man was beaten to death at his home in the occupied West Bank.Sraya Ofer, a retired colonel, was killed after going to investigate noises coming from his garden in the northern Jordan Valley, police say.His wife was injured but escaped and raise the alarm. Checkpoints were set up as security forces scoured the area.Israeli media say the couple had been attacked with iron bars and axes.Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Peter Lerner said the Palestinians had been detained in an investigation "focused on intelligence".The attack took place at around 01:00 (22:00 GMT) at Brosh Habiqa resort, part of the West Bank settlement of Shadmot Mehola.The woman, who escaped through a security fence, told police the attackers were Palestinians.The incident happened in a part of the Jordan Valley which Israel captured in the war of 1967 where the construction of Israeli homes and businesses is widely considered a breach of international law - something Israel does not accept, says the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Jerusalem.The dead man is the third Israeli to be killed in what Israel characterises as "terror attacks" in the last month in the West Bank. Two serving soldiers have also died.Israel security officials quoted in the local media have not appeared to detect a pattern in the sudden increase in the level of violence, but at least one right-wing member of the cabinet has said Israel should respond by ending peace talks with the Palestinians, our correspondent adds.</body>

      <title>Egypt condemns US aid suspension</title>
      <description>Egypt's army-backed government condemns a decision by the US to suspend some of its financial and military aid over a crackdown on Islamists.</description>

      <body>Egypt has criticised a decision by the US to suspend a large part of the $1.3bn (£810m) in aid it receives, following months of political turmoil.A government spokesman in Cairo said the move was wrong and Egypt would "not surrender to American pressure".The US said this week it was suspending the delivery of large-scale military systems and withholding cash support.But US Secretary of State John Kerry later stressed the decision was not "a withdrawal from our relationship"."The interim government understands very well our commitment to the success of this government," Mr Kerry said.He was speaking shortly after Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty criticised Washington's move, saying Egypt was "continuing on its path towards democracy".Since the Egyptian army ousted Mohammed Morsi as president in July, the authorities have clashed repeatedly with his Muslim Brotherhood supporters.The US state department launched a review of its aid to Egypt in August after a crackdown that left hundreds of people dead.On Wednesday, it said it would halt the delivery of Apache helicopters, as well as Harpoon missiles and tank parts.Washington would also halt a $260m cash transfer and a $300m loan guarantee, officials said.The freeze was not intended to be permanent, the state department added."We will continue to hold the delivery of certain large-scale military systems and cash assistance to the government pending credible progress toward an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government through free and fair elections," state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says the suspension of aid is more symbolic than a painful cut in essential aid.The announcement had been expected, with deliveries of military hardware already halted, a military exercise cancelled, and cash aid in effect on hold since the summer, our correspondent says.The US will continue to provide health and education assistance, and money to help Egypt to ensure security in the increasingly volatile Sinai peninsula.</body>

      <title>Clegg and Cable 'split' over leaks</title>
      <description>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.</description>

      <date>1381502403</date>
      <body>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.Mr Cable said the newspaper performed a "very considerable public service" by publishing details of documents leaked by Edward Snowden.But Mr Clegg reaffirmed his belief it was "not good at all" and said the information could "help terrorists".Downing Street said the security services' review system works well.A spokesman, however, said the prime minister is ready to listen to ideas for improving the system.He was speaking as Mr Cable also called for "proper political oversight of the intelligence services".Earlier, Sir David Omand, a UK security expert and former No 10 advisor described the leaks by Mr Snowden as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".In May, Mr Snowden leaked information to the Guardian about mass surveillance programmes such as the US National Security Agency's Prism and GCHQ's Tempora operations.The Guardian has defended its decision to publish documents leaked by the former US intelligence worker, who was granted asylum in Russia, and has vowed to publish more.Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4' Today programme: "I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service."I think Mr Snowden's contribution is two-fold. One is a positive one - the whistleblowing - the other is more worrying which is a large amount of genuinely important intelligence material does seem to have been passed across."We do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now."But Mr Clegg told the BBC: "My view is that publishing information, technical information which can help terrorists work out how to do harm to us, of course, that is not good at all."But of course there is a legitimate, wider debate, an ongoing debate, about how do you make sure, as both the intelligence agencies and those who wish to do us harm, use these considerable new powers at their disposal in information technology, how do we make sure that all of that is held properly to account."Earlier this year, the Justice and Security Act 2013 gave the government's Intelligence and Security committee greater powers to scrutinise the work of the security services.Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be no review of the oversight of the security services, despite Guardian reports that Mr Clegg was to start conversations in government about one.The prime minister said on Thursday "a good legal framework" already existed.A spokesman said Mr Cameron "thinks the current system is a good one and it works well," but "if others have ideas he is prepared to listen to them".Mr Clegg responded to the question of more oversight of the security services on Friday saying the government had already "significantly strengthened the powers of oversight".But he added that "many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified".Former Home Secretary Jack Straw also hit out at the Guardian saying its stance was "indulgent irresponsibility" which did not help protect the public.His comments come in an interview to be broadcast on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales.He said the Guardian had a "sense of power of having these secrets and excitement... about these secrets has gone to their heads"."They are blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are - are or not - likely to damage the national interest," said Mr Straw.Sir David, who is also a former head of the UK's communications surveillance centre GCHQ, told The Times there needed to be a difference acknowledged between whistleblowing to spark a debate and "the stealing of 58,000 top-secret British security documents" which he called "seriously, seriously damaging"."The assumption the experts are working on is that all that information or almost all of it will now be in the hands of Moscow and Beijing," he added.Nigel Inkster, who was director of operations and intelligence at MI6, and is now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told BBC Radio 4 programme The World at One he agreed with Sir David.He said terrorists would have a better awareness of how vulnerable it was to communicate with each other "via any one or any group of communications options that are available to them".He added that in terms of state-on-state espionage, "some of the reach and sophistication of the systems and capabilities developed by NSA and GCHQ have now been compromised".</body>

      <title>Royal Mail shares jump sharply</title>
      <description>Shares in Royal Mail rise as high as 456p in conditional trading - up 38% on their initial 330p offer price - before easing back.</description>

      <body>Royal Mail shares rose more than 38% to 456p at the start of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p per share, valuing the 500-year-old company at £3.3bn. The value rose £1.1bn after trading began.At midday, the shares had eased back to 435p, 31.8% up. Private investors received 227 shares each.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Business Secretary Vince Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <body>Foxconn, the world's biggest contract electronics maker, has admitted student interns worked shifts at a factory in China that were in violation of its company policies.The firm, which makes products for some the world's biggest brands, has been under scrutiny for labour practices.It had admitted to hiring underage interns at the same unit last year.Foxconn said actions had been taken to bring the factory "into full compliance with our code and policies"."There have been a few instances where our policies pertaining to overtime and night shift work were not enforced," the company said in a statement.The manufacturing giant is owned by Taiwanese group Hon Hai Precision and employs about 800,000 workers around the globe.Foxconn, while not a household name in itself for many consumers, is used by most of the big technology giants around the world, including Apple, Sony, Microsoft, HP, and Nokia.It first came under scrutiny for its labour practices when 13 employees committed suicide at its Chinese plants in 2010.The incidents raised concerns over working conditions at its units in China and drew attention to growing labour strikes.For its part, Foxconn responded by raising wages, shortening working hours and employing counsellors on site.It also installed suicide nets to factory living-quarters at its Shenzhen factory.Also in 2010, Foxconn temporarily shut down a unit in India after 250 workers fell sick.And in May 2011, two people were killed after an explosion at a company plant in Chengdu.</body>

      <body>JPMorgan Chase has reported a loss in the third quarter after setting aside $9.2bn (£5.8bn) to cover legal bills.The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year.JPMorgan is currently in talks with the US government over a potentially huge settlement relating to the sale of mortgage-related investment products in the run-up to the financial crisis.Last month, it paid $920m to settle charges related to a trading scandal.JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: "We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them."He stressed that the bank's underlying business was strong.Stripping out one-off charges, the bank made $5.8bn over the three months to the end of September.Wells Fargo, the biggest US mortgage lender, also reported results on Friday.It reported a record net income of $5.3bn in the third quarter, up 13% on the same period in 2012.That rise came despite a fall in income at its mortgage business, where revenue fell 43% to $1.6bn.The fall was offset by lower expenses and a reduction in funds set aside for loans going bad.JPMorgan now has a contingency fund of $23bn to cover legal expenses. It also said that it could face litigation-related expenses of another $6.8bn.It is currently in talks with the Justice Department over a potentially huge settlement, related to the mis-selling of mortgage related products during the US housing boom.It is thought the settlement could cost as much as $11bn.Mr Dimon stressed on Friday that much of the case related to deals done by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, companies that JPMorgan Chase bought during the financial crisis."The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues and one that recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the US government," he said.Last month, JPMorgan paid $920m to settle a case related to disastrous trades by Bruno Iksil, who earned the nickname the "London Whale" for his big bets on the financial markets.Last year, the bank admitted to losses of $6.2bn resulting from his activities.As part of the settlement deal, JPMorgan admitted violating US federal securities laws.</body>

      <title>French court upholds fracking ban</title>
      <description>France's constitutional council rejects an attempt to overturn a ban on fracking, the controversial method of extracting gas from rock.</description>

      <body>France's constitutional council has rejected an attempt to overturn a ban on fracking, the controversial method of extracting gas from rock.US-based firm Schuepbach Energy challenged a ban imposed in 2011 based on potential risks to the environment.President Francois Hollande has opposed the technology, as have the Greens, a partner in the governing coalition.France, which relies heavily on nuclear power, has some of the largest shale gas deposits in Europe.Following the 2011 ban, Schuepbach, which had two exploration licences cancelled in southern France, appealed on four counts."The constitutional council threw out these four complaints and ruled that the disputed components of the 13 July 2011 law comply with the constitution," the council said in a statement.The Constitutional Council, made up of judges and former French presidents, has the power to annul laws if they are deemed to be unconstitutional.France's Energy Minister Philippe Martin said the ruling meant the law banning fracking, in which pressurised water, chemicals and sand are pumped underground to release gas trapped in shale formations, was now safe from other legal challenges."It's a legal victory, but also an environmental and political one," Mr Martin said at a news briefing.The US Energy Information Administration estimates shale gas reserves worth five trillion cubic meters could lie in French soil, mainly in the Paris basin and the Rhone valley.French oil giant Total is still awaiting a ruling after it separately appealed at the end of 2011 against the government's decision to ban its own exploration permit by the south-eastern town of Montelimar.</body>

      <title>La Liga head makes match-fixing claim</title>
      <description>Spanish league chief Javier Tebas says that at least eight matches in Spain's top two divisions are fixed each season.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24491682</url>
      <date>1381493587</date>
      <body>Spanish league president Javier Tebas says that at least eight matches in Spain's top two divisions are fixed each season.Speaking on the BBC's World Football Show, Tebas also called for lifetime bans for those involved in match-fixing.He said: "Between the first and second divisions, around eight to 10 games have been manipulated [per season]."If they do not eradicate it immediately, the infection will grow."Tebas, who is in charge of Spain's top two flights, also told the Leaders in Football conference event in London, through a translator, that he believed the main problem was coming from an international mafia."It sounds easier for players with financial problems to be corrupted but we cannot generalise it," he added. "It happens also with players who earn a lot of money, who are comfortable but I am trying to eradicate the black sheep in La Liga."If we do not eradicate now, it will become like the Wild West with no laws, no control."In May, Deportivo La Coruna president Augusto Cesar Lendoiro claimed match-fixing was widespread in Spain after the Spanish Football League said it was investigating his side's win over Levante in April.Lendoiro has denied his side rigged the result of the game.But Tebas believes that there needs to be severe punishments for those found guilty."If a player, coach, director has been directly involved, he will have a lifetime ban," added Tebas. "If he knows about it but doesn't participate and doesn't tell the authorities, he will have a three-year ban."His remarks come after the head of the international police organisation Interpol told the BBC World Service that law enforcement agencies around the world are behind in the battle against match-fixing.Secretary General of Interpol Ron Noble said that so pervasive and sophisticated are the techniques of the worldwide betting syndicates, it is impossible to know how deep the problem now goes.</body>

      <title>Vettel heads Japan second practice</title>
      <description>Sebastian Vettel heads Mark Webber in a Red Bull one-two during Friday practice at the Japanese Grand Prix.</description>

      <date>1381474369</date>
      <body>Sebastian Vettel headed Mark Webber in a Red Bull one-two in Friday practice at the Japanese Grand Prix.Vettel, who had been third behind the two Mercedes cars in the first session, outpaced Webber by 0.168 seconds.Mercedes' Nico Rosberg was third fastest, 0.262secs off Vettel, and ahead of Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean.Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton was sixth and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso 10th after a spin at the Degner corners.Minutes before the end of the second session, it emerged that former Marussia test driver Maria de Villota had been found dead in her hotel room in Seville.Suzuka lived up to its reputation as one of the most difficult tracks in the world, catching out even the best drivers, with Vettel, Alonso, Hamilton and Raikkonen all having moments of varying severity."The balance is decent," said Vettel. "I think we can still improve the car, especially looking after the tyres, which will be crucial for the race."It's tricky. We've seen a lot of drivers struggling, it's a difficult track."Alonso, who must finish eighth or better on Sunday if Vettel wins to prevent the German from winning the title, promised on Thursday that he would "attack" for the rest of the season now his title hopes were all but over and he had an uncharacteristically messy day.He ran wide at both the Hairpin and Spoon Curve in the first session and then had a spin on his first flying lap on the faster 'medium' tyre, ensuring he did not set a representative time and ended the session 0.389secs slower than team-mate Felipe Massa.It was a sobering day for Alonso, for a glance at the times suggests that finishing eighth may not be that easy.That is the position where Massa ended up - behind the Red Bulls, the Mercedes, the Lotuses and the surprise Toro Rosso of Daniel Ricciardo.Alonso's struggles appeared to confirm the impression that Ferrari have slipped backwards in the last few races.Hamilton and Vettel joined Alonso in having incidents.The Englishman got his Mercedes on to the exit kerb at Degner Two but rescued the car, while Lotus's Romain Grosjean had a very similar moment a few minutes later.And Vettel had a brief off-track excursion at Spoon Curve before rejoining.Others were not so lucky.Raikkonen got in his medium tyre qualifying simulation run but then spun in the middle of the fast Dunlop Curve and beached the car in the gravel during his race-simulation run.Both McLaren's Sergio Perez and Williams's Pastor Maldonado crashed early in the session, and missed out on both their qualifying and race-simulation runs.Maldonado lost his car at the tricky Degner Two corner, where Marussia's Jules Bianchi and Caterham's Giedo van der Garde had both crashed in the first session.Perez then spun at the entry to Spoon Curve after letting his outside wheels stray partially off the track as he turned in at about 120mph.The McLaren hit the barrier heavily side-on but Perez, who is under pressure because he has still not had his contract renewed for next season, was unhurt."On the entry I put a wheel on the asphalt and I lost the back end," said Perez. "There is not much room so I went straight into the wall."McLaren managing director Jonathan Neale said "internal discussions" were still taking place over Perez's future, but confirmed that Button, who was ninth, was under contract.Full second practice results.</body>

      <title>Cleverley out of final England games</title>
      <description>Midfielder Tom Cleverley is ruled out of England's remaining two World Cup qualifiers because of a calf injury.</description>

      <date>1381495667</date>
      <body>Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley will miss England's two remaining World Cup qualifying matches at Wembley because of a calf injury.The 24-year-old had a scan after training on Thursday and was ruled out of both Friday's match with Montenegro and Tuesday's contest against Poland.The only other absentee for England in Friday's match is Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole, 32, who has a rib injury.England currently lead Group H by one point from Ukraine and Montenegro.Coach Roy Hodgson said he had been impressed by Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge this week."It's nice to see Daniel Sturridge come into the squad and be so comfortable at an early stage," he said."It's also nice to see him strike up a good relationship with the more senior players he's been partnering this week."It's not only the strikers I've been impressed by. The whole squad has had a very good week's training."Sturridge could partner Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney on Friday night but Hodgson refused to confirm whether the pair would both play.It is not yet clear whether Cole will be able to feature in England's last group game against Poland.The 32-year-old was hurt during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Norwich and has been replaced in Hodgson's squad by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs.Cole started England's last two World Cup qualifiers - a 0-0 draw with Ukraine on 10 September and a 4-0 win over Moldova four days earlier.His absence means Everton's Leighton Baines, who has won 19 caps and scored in England's 5-0 win over Moldova last year, is likely to start against Montenegro.England need to win both matches at Wembley to guarantee World Cup qualification.They must finish top of the group for automatic qualification for the 2014 finals in Brazil, while second place would mean a two-legged play-off in November.Montenegro are expected to be without captain Mirko Vucinic, goalkeeper Mladen Bozovic, centre-back Marko Basa and midfielder Miodrag Pekovic because of injury.</body>

      <title>Yeti classic among Doctor Who trove</title>
      <description>The discovery in Nigeria of nine lost episodes of 1960s Doctor Who includes the classic story The Web of Fear, in which Patrick Troughton's Doctor battles robot yeti in the London Underground.</description>

      <date>1381446138</date>
      <body>Nine missing episodes of 1960s Doctor Who have been found at a TV station in Nigeria, including most of the classic story The Web of Fear.The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground.Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World.It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades."It's thrilling," said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who."Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible."The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s.However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes.In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos.The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive.Mr Morris said: "The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria. I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who. When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special."He said it had been a "lucky" find given the high temperatures in the African country. "Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition."Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive. The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story.Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever. Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered.Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday.The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97.One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm.Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield.Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton).The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea.The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system."It's the quintessential Doctor Who story," said Gatiss. "It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location."He said it showed Troughton "at the height of his powers".Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret.The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers.Recalling Troughton's "wonderful sense of humour" on set, Watling said: "We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle. We had a chemistry and I think it showed."How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? "I couldn't quite believe it. There had been hoaxes before. I thought it was just another hoax."Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991.Hines said: "This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork."The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.</body>

      <body>Actor Craig Bierko, who replaced Bertie Carvel in the role of Miss Trunchbull in the Broadway production of Matilda, has bowed out of the role for 12 weeks.Bierko was originally scheduled to begin performances in the show on 3 September, but delayed his start by two weeks, citing a shoulder injury.A statement from the press office earlier this week said the injury had been "aggravated during performance".Bierko was nominated for a Tony for his leading role in 2000's The Music Man."Craig Bierko will be taking a 12-week disability leave from the production," the press office said. "At this time, understudies Chris Hoch and Ben Thompson will be playing Miss Trunchbull."Bierko, whose film credits have included the Oscar-nominated 2005 film Cinderella Man and 1996's The Long Kiss Goodnight, took over the role of the tyrannical, hammer-throwing headmistress from Carvel, who originated the role in the London production earning an Olivier award.Bierko's most recent Broadway appearance was in the 2009 production of Guys and Dolls. He has appeared in a string of small screen hits including Ally McBeal and Sex and the City.He was also cast as Dave Lister in the pilot for the US version of Red Dwarf, but the series was never made.Based on the Roald Dahl book about a girl with magical powers, British hit Matilda opened to rave reviews in New York in April.It premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Courtyard Theatre in November 2010 and later transferred to the West End's Cambridge Theatre, where it continues to run.The show, whose music and lyrics were penned by comedian Tim Minchin, was nominated for 12 Tonys this year - winning four - as well as a special Tony honour for the four girls alternating in the title role.</body>

      <title>Robbie Williams 'gutted' by R1 snub</title>
      <description>The singer admits he is jealous of younger pop stars, like One Direction, who are guaranteed airplay on the BBC network.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24487746</url>
      <date>1381474102</date>
      <body>Pop star Robbie Williams says he is "gutted" that BBC Radio 1 no longer plays his records."I'm very ambitious," he told BBC Radio 4's Mastertapes programme. "So when Radio 1 goes and is taken away from you, a huge bit of your arsenal goes.""It's your main oxygen to get your stuff out there."Radio 1 failed to put Williams' number one single Candy on their playlist last year, but his recent collaboration with Dizzee Rascal did make it on the air.The star's new swing album, Swings Both Ways, is unlikely to be a fixture on the station.Radio 1's breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw previously said Williams, 39, was "not relevant" to his target audience of 15-29 year olds."I liked Take That when I was little, but I'm not little anymore," he told Five news."I don't know if he's now for a Radio 1 audience."The station's head of music has also said rock groups Green Day and Muse may have outgrown the station."The last Green Day project simply wasn't good enough," George Ergatoudis told trade magazine Music Week.Muse, meanwhile "are approaching a crossroads" - their last single was the first one not playlisted by Radio 1 in a decade."The door remains open to them but we'll have to think carefully about their next album."'Over-sensitive'Speaking to John Wilson, Williams admitted he was jealous of the younger pop stars who are guaranteed airplay, including One Direction's Harry Styles."He's talented, he's good looking. He could have it away," said Williams."And I'll be sat here saying 'damn him'.But, he continued, "everybody who's anybody has been competitive and over-sensitive and a bit silly"."Look at Paul McCartney, look at Elton John. They're jealous of Justin Timberlake. I'm sure they were jealous of me when I was in my imperial phase."The Mastertapes series looks at a classic album in depth - in this instance Life Thru A Lens, Williams' debut record.Released in 1997, the album featured the hit singles Angels and Let Me Entertain You.In the wide-ranging interview, he discussed how the album was recorded in the depths of the alcohol-fuelled depression that followed his exit from Take That.Co-writer Guy Chambers recalled how Williams was often "too drunk to make it" to recording sessions."We were often trying to get him to do the vocal for Angels," he said. "That went on for weeks."Williams also revealed that he could no longer take to the stage without a lyric sheet, after forgetting the words to Angels on a live edition of The X Factor in 2009."It caused a chink in the armour," he admitted.The third series of Mastertapes will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in November.Other guests include David Crosby, discussing his solo debut If I Could Only Remember My Name, and Soul II Soul, on 1989's influential Club Classics Vol 1.Edwyn Collins and Natalie Merchant also take part.Recorded at the BBC's Maida Vale studios, each artist also plays live tracks from the album under discussion.Mastertapes: Robbie Williams A-Side will be broadcast on Monday, 11 November at 23:00, the B-Side programme will follow on 12 November at 15:30.</body>

      <body>At the side of a dusty unpaved road in the centre of Domiz camp, Lukman stands talking to his colleagues, whilst puffing on his cigarette.With his low-waist jeans, short-sleeved shirt and tattooed tiger on his left arm, the 26-year-old could be mistaken for a young Western man.But in fact Lukman was born to a Kurdish family in Qamishli, northern Syria. He did not finish his high school education, as his family could not afford it.Lukman moved to the capital, Damascus, where he found employment as a construction worker building blocks of flats.But behind his handsome looks and shy smile lies deep pain and anguish borne out of a particularly difficult experience.Lukman is a defector - not from the army, but from the most feared security service in Syria, namely the air force."I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The killing and torture of other Syrians right before my eyes was devastating but when I saw three of my colleagues killed right in front of me I made my mind up and started planning for running away," Lukman said, his deep voice choked with emotion.Lukman was performing his military duty when the uprising began in March 2011. He was surprised that he would be allocated to a security branch given his Kurdish background."I didn't understand how I can be trusted and sent to such a place where only members of [President Bashar al-Assad's] Alawite community would operate," he said."But I had no choice. No-one has a choice in Syria but to follow orders."Lukman took part in many security raids detaining protesters in different parts of Damascus.He recalls one day in particular, when more than 100 men were arrested in a raid on the town of Muadhamiya, west of Damascus."The beating and torture starts from the minute we find our target. It won't stop," he says. "But on that day, we stopped on the Muadhamiya bridge, just off the neighbourhood that's inhabited by Alawites loyal to Assad."The men were brought to where our cars and buses were parked. One protester was taken from one car to the other and that's when the civilians of Alawite community arrived and started beating the protester."They used everything - sticks, stones, their fists and feet . While beating him they were chanting "Long live Assad". A few minutes later, the protester was a dead body on the ground. We took him in the car and put him in a refrigerator," Lukman recalled with bitterness."The only thing that makes me sleep at night is that I never participated in any of these atrocities. I never tortured anyone and never killed anyone," he said with a deep sigh.To avoid such scenes, Lukman asked his boss to send him on simple missions where he didn't have to do any hard job.He was lucky, he said, that his boss agreed and sent him to Damascus University whenever there was a protest taking place there.But there was yet another scene of violence, this time at the hands of the Student Union, a branch of ruling Baath Party organisation."All the union people were Alawites and supporters of Assad," Lukman said."When a protest takes place involving 20 to 30 students, colleagues from the Student Union would come in triple the numbers and start beating them."It was too much to take, Syrians killing Syrians by order of the government," he said. "The torture that happened inside prison are beyond what you can imagine."Lukman served at Mezzeh military airport, in the western suburb of Damascus on the route to Beirut.It is known to be a detention centre as well as a military base where rockets are fired at rural Damascus and fighter planes take off on bombing raids.The hangars were transformed into detention centres, with more than 1,500 detainees held in each, Lukman explained."You can find all sort of people there - politicians, protesters, Free Syrian Army members. They all face same destiny of torture and the ones who leave the detention centres alive, they become mad," he said."No government on earth can do this to its own people and they keep claiming there is terrorism. They are worse than al-Qaeda".But the situation became more risky after the uprising became an armed one, Lukman said.Sunni soldiers and others like him coming from the eastern side of the country were always sent to the frontlines and hot-spots where they got killed."The Alawite officers were always kept in safe places so they avoid any killing or retaliation, while Sunnis were sent to be killed while trying to kill other Syrians," he said.The tipping-point came when three of Lukman's friends were killed on the battlefield where they had been sent."I couldn't take this. I didn't want to hold weapons and fire at other Syrians, nor did I want to be killed by fellow Syrians who were trying to protect themselves from the army. I made up my mind and faked my death," he said."I didn't want to switch sides as I fear informants," he added. "There are many informants in the FSA [Free Syrian Army]. All their movements are reported and many times these informants would act under orders from the regime, committing atrocities in the name of the revolution to defame it."One day Lukman was on a mission in Harasta, an eastern suburb of Damascus that rebelled against President Assad.He sent a text message to his boss telling him he was being ambushed by the FSA and would be killed. In fact, he was on a bus heading to Qamishli, using his friend's ID card so he could cross checkpoints.He switched off his phone and "disappeared" from then.For the Syrian government, Lukman may be dead or they may have discovered that he defected.But for Lukman, his new life started here in Domiz camp away from the violence he witnessed."I don't want to think or tell the stories of what I lived through. This is a nightmare and when I talk about it I feel as if I am living it again. I want to forget and move on. I want to be normal."Listen to Lina Sinjab's report from Domiz refugee camp on BBC World Service's The Fifth Floor at 21:00 GMT on Friday 11 October, or listen again on iPlayer.

      <title>Will Africa pull out of the ICC?</title>
      <description>Why are only African leaders going to The Hague?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24452288</url>
      <date>1381475019</date>
      <body>With Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta under pressure to appear at the International Criminal Court next month to answer charges of crimes against humanity, the African Union (AU) has called a special summit to discuss Africa's relationship with the court. BBC Africa's Farouk Chothia reports.The AU is heavily divided over the ICC, with East African leaders facing strong resistance from their West African counterparts in their campaign to whip up hostility towards the court.Opposition towards the 11-year-old ICC runs deepest in East Africa - not surprising as two of the region's presidents - Sudan's Omar al-Bashir and Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta - have been indicted, while Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto is already on trial on charges of crimes against humanity."There are strong passions around the issue. The ICC has been on the agenda of every AU summit since Mr Bashir's indictment," Steven Gruzd, an analyst with the South African Institute of International Affairs, told the BBC."The countries that are most vocal in their opposition to the ICC are in East Africa - Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. West African countries like Nigeria and Ghana are more supportive of the court," he said.The AU has called an extraordinary summit, due to take place on Friday and Saturday, in an attempt to ratchet up pressure on the ICC ahead of Mr Kenyatta's trial next month.Despite widespread speculation that the summit will consider calling on all 34 African members to pull out of the ICC, Kenya's Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed said on Wednesday that it was "quite naive" to think that leaders would "come together with the sole aim" of breaking ties with the court.Mr Ruto's and Mr Kenyatta's trials are unprecedented - they are the first serving leaders to be tried by an international court.Mr Ruto had to ask for his trial to be adjourned, so he could return home to deal with the recent Westgate shopping centre terror attack. He was given a week's delay - less than he had requested."In advanced countries, sitting presidents are not hauled before courts. It's for the courts to wait for the president to finish their terms before proceedings can be instituted," Ms Mohamed told a news conference.Like Mr Ruto, Mr Kenyatta is accused of organising violence after disputed elections in 2007, leaving some 1,100 people dead and 600,000 homeless.Both deny the charges, and won in elections in March this year, with voters ignoring warnings by the US of "consequences" if they were propelled to power.Mr Bashir, accused of genocide in Darfur, has refused to stand trial, as Sudan, unlike Kenya, does not recognise the ICC's jurisdiction.His indictment in 2008 led to relations between the 54-member AU and the ICC plummeting, with the AU calling on countries to ignore an ICC arrest warrant for Mr Bashir, claiming that he enjoyed presidential immunity and that putting him on trial could jeopardise peace efforts in Darfur."The Kenyatta and Ruto trials have brought tensions to a head," London School of Economics researcher Mark Kersten, who set up the Justice in Conflict blog, told the BBC."The perception that the court is neo-colonialist and anti-African has burgeoned and solidified [in the AU]."Significantly, South Africa, a major power-broker in the AU, which has been reticent to publicly criticise the ICC up to now, has joined the fray.The governing African National Congress (ANC) accused the court of staging a "judicial coup" by insisting that Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto be present throughout their trials, rather than only at the initial and final stages."There is clear evidence that the ICC is used more to effect regime change in the majority of cases," it said.Though South Africa was a staunch advocate of the ICC's creation, its position is now closer to that of neighbouring Zimbabwe, which has always been a fierce opponent of the court."President Mugabe sees the court as a tool of imperialists. He believes that Tony Blair and George Bush should be in the dock for the war in Iraq," Mr Grudz said."He is charismatic and dynamic and has clout in the AU. He can often change the game."In contrast, only small southern African states such as Botswana, Lesotho and Mauritius are firm supporters of the ICC.In North Africa, there is even less support for the ICC with only Tunisia recognising its jurisdiction.But with the region in turmoil following the uprising against long-serving rulers, Mr Grudz said he does not expect it to play an influential role at the summit.Of the AU's 54 members, 34 have ratified the Rome Statute which established the ICC.Significantly, the AU has failed to improve its relations with the ICC since the appointment of Gambian lawyer Fatou Bensouda as chief prosecutor last year.This is despite the fact that it had lobbied for Ms Bensouda to become the ICC's first African chief prosecutor, succeeding Argentina's Louis Moreno Ocampo."The ICC made overtures to set up a liaison office in Addis Ababa, but it was rebuffed by the AU," Mr Grudz said.One of the AU's main criticisms of the ICC is that it has only prosecuted Africans, suggesting that it is pursuing selective justice.However, Mr Kersten pointed out that the ICC is carrying out investigations in other parts of the world, including Georgia and Colombia, although no-one has yet been charged there.Charges have only been laid in eight countries - all in Africa: The Central African Republic; Democratic Republic of Congo; Ivory Coast; Kenya; Libya; Sudan and Uganda."In a lot of theses cases, the ICC intervened after referrals to it by governments," Mr Kersten said."It's not unusual for states to wear two masks, to engage with the ICC when it suits them and to criticise it when it doesn't. It's all very political."A good example of this is Uganda, which asked the ICC to investigate the rebellion waged in the north by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) - a move that led to the court issuing an arrest warrant for the group's leader, Joseph Kony.But at Mr Kenyatta's inauguration as Kenya's leader in April this year, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said he no longer supported the ICC because it was being used by "arrogant actors" who were trying to "install leaders of their choice in Africa and eliminate those they don't like".In contrast, Ghana's President John Mahama has expressed strong support for the ICC.In an interview with France 24 after the AU denounced the ICC for "hunting" Africans at a meeting in May, he said: "I will not go as far as accusing the ICC of racism... I think the ICC has done a fantastic job in bringing some people who have committed genocide and mass murder to justice."However, Mr Kersten acknowledged that some of the AU's concerns were valid."It would be folly to deny the fact that the ICC works within an international structure that is far too unequal... This structure reinforces the reality that powerful states are too often shielded from accountability," he said, pointing out that three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, China and Russia - do not recognise the ICC's jurisdiction over their territories."The court's promise was to transcend this by being an impartial institution independent of the realpolitik machinations of institutions like the UN Security Council and "great powers" like the US. It hasn't been able to do so," he said.The UN Security Council has only referred conflicts in Africa - Libya and Darfur - to the ICC for investigation."The UN Security Council is very politicised and the ICC will have to think more critically about how its relationship with the body and the US are perceived by the rest of the world," Mr Kersten said."If its work is constantly politicised by major powers, the whole system of international justice will be weakened. That will be a price too high to pay."Mr Grudz said that while many African governments are hostile towards the ICC, their constituents are strong supporters of it."There is a fundamental divide between African leaders and African people," he said.On Monday, about 130 non-governmental organisations wrote an open letter to the AU, warning that "any withdrawal from the ICC would send the wrong signal about Africa's commitment to protect and promote human rights and to reject impunity".Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has also warned African leaders not to quit the ICC."If they fight the ICC, vote against the ICC, withdraw their cases, it will be a badge of shame for each and every one of them and for their countries if they do that," he said, when delivering the annual Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture in Cape Town on Monday.Mr Kersten said that while Kenya's parliament has voted to withdraw from the ICC, he does not expect this to happen."It will require the head of state, who made a promise during the election campaign to co-operate with the ICC, to deposit a motion at the UN saying: 'We are withdrawing.' It's not a politically intelligent thing to do."Leaving the ICC is not a pressing issue in any other African state... It is more politically sensible to remain part of the ICC system and selectively endorse and criticize it from the inside," he said.Hinting that this was Ghana's approach, Mr Mahama told France 24 that while he supported the ICC, he opposed its decision to try Mr Kenyatta, who was elected to office five years after the violence for which he has been called to account."What would you say - the verdict of the Kenyan people or the verdict of the ICC, which of them is more important?" he asked.But international lawyers argue that the whole point of the ICC is to prevent national leaders from using the "shield" of immunity to escape prosecution for the atrocities which some have been accused of carrying out.</body>

      <title>A list for living, not a bucket list</title>
      <description>What 50 experiences would you want before you died?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477163</url>
      <date>1381454569</date>
      <body>Many people now make bucket lists. The BBC's Helen Fawkes explores the experiences people want before they die, and her own "list for living".What would you do if you found out that your time was limited? If you were told that you could be dead within months, you certainly had no more than five years to live?Well, that's the situation which I'm facing. On Christmas Eve last year I found out that I had incurable ovarian cancer. I felt waves of shock, sadness and anger. But I also knew that once I'd come to terms with the devastating news, I was going to make the most of the time I had left.A few days before the diagnosis, as I waited for one of many medical appointments, I thought about the things I might never do. I started to write down some of the stuff in my reporter's notebook. This was the start of my bucket list.Getting a dog, exploring the ancient ruins in Rome, taking a speed boat down the Thames, having my book published, learning to play poker and seeing penguins in the South Pole are just some of the 50 things I want to do.This has become known as a bucket list because it's all the things you want to achieve before you kick the bucket. But I don't like the term. I'd rather focus on the living, not the dying. I prefer to call it my "list for living".This cancer business is so horrific that it can easily take over your identity. Having this gives you something else to focus on and makes you feel like you again. So far I've managed to do 10 of them. I've pulled a pint in my local pub, I went to Paris with a group of friends just for lunch, modelled in a fashion show and zoomed down a zip wire. Next weekend I will present a Radio 4 programme, Pick of the Week, which will mean another big tick.But what's most important to me is right at the top of the list - move to the countryside and live in my own house. This is also what I wrote down in my notepad while I waited at hospital back in the winter. A couple of months ago I finally got my own home in a village. It needs lots of work to coax it out of the 1980s but once its done I'll be able to live there. It's an incredible feeling doing something I've wanted for years.I'm not sure I'll ever get to do everything on my bucket list but Susan Spencer-Wendel, from Florida, is someone who has. Susan is terminally ill with ALS, or motor neurone disease, an incurable condition which destroys the nerves that power her muscles.Susan realised that she had around a year left of relatively good health so she went on all the trips she wanted to with her loved ones. This included going to see the Northern Lights with her best friend and wedding dress shopping in New York with her teenage daughter - something she knew she'd never get to do for real.Susan wrote about her story in Until I say Goodbye: My Year of Living with Joy - A book she tapped out on an iPhone using just one thumb. She told me that her joy came from getting the best possible outcome from the worst of circumstances."I discovered the depth of love I have for the people around me and the depth of love they have for me. I discovered friends I never knew I had. And this lifts me each and every hour."Just like Susan, my list for living is about taking back some control. When you're told that you could die soon, many of your future plans are shattered. Life revolves around tests, treatments and trying desperately to feel well.My bucket list has given me some kind of a structure. There are no excuses anymore. You have to get on and do things rather than thinking you must do it someday. It's almost like giving pleasure a priority, in doing so you create powerful memories. I have one friend who must have spent hundreds of hours at hospital with me so it was really special to be able to do something totally unconnected with cancer and go glass-blowing.My list for living has made me realise that when I'm taking part in something I enjoy I feel so much better. It gives me a real boost. In May, I went to see Stonehenge at sunrise with a friend. As soon as I stood inside the ancient stone circle it was like my chemo fog lifted.For a magical hour, just the two of us watched night turn into day. As we left, the spell was broken. Not long afterwards I felt so chronically ill that I was barely able to walk.This was near to the end of some very toxic treatment. What helped to get me through it all was my plan to recover afterwards on a ridiculously perfect beach. It was so chilly and wet at times that I needed my coat but I had a blissful time in Cornwall. It was number five on my list so this shows you how badly I wanted the holiday. It's so vital to have something to look forward to. I may be fighting a killer disease but I still need some hope in my life.I used to be very sporty and I still crave that adrenalin rush so I picked a few things like sky diving and swimming with sharks just because they would terrify me. I haven't yet been brave enough to do those. But I have been driven very fast around a racetrack. A friend arranged for the ex-Formula 1 star David Coulthard to drive me around Silverstone. The speed was so exhilarating that I couldn't even scream to start with. It's funny how being scared to death can make you feel so alive.One of the reasons I responded to my diagnosis with a bucket list was because of a book I'd recently read, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. Bronnie Ware looked after terminally ill people in Australia. She realised that many of them shared the same concerns. For example, they wished they hadn't worked so hard and they'd allowed themselves to be happy.When I interviewed Bronnie for my documentary she told me that one of her favourite clients was a woman called Grace. She always wanted to travel but didn't because of her husband."She was a lady who spent her life in a very unhappy, dominating marriage. Her husband went into a nursing home because he was ill. She then became terminally ill within a few weeks of gaining the freedom that she had waited 50 or 60 years for. So she actually never got to live any of those dreams and she insisted on me promising her that I would live a life true to myself," Bronnie explained.I'm glad that I don't have any big regrets. This is partly down to another bucket list that I made. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with cancer for the very first time. While I was ill from the evil chemo cocktails I couldn't do anything but think about what I wanted to do once I was well again. I came up with a list of 10 things. Within weeks of finishing treatment I was in Moscow, pursuing my dream of becoming a BBC foreign correspondent.I'm clearly a fan of bucket lists but I understand that they're not for everyone. I wonder whether they create too much pressure to try to cram in everything? Psychotherapist Philippa Perry is worried that some people may have one for the wrong reasons."My first reaction is to think of it in terms of a shopping list. It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It's not about being alive, it's about going through the motions."My aim is not just to have things to tick off but to be left with a whole load of special memories with the people who mean the most to me. I know that when I'm dying and I'm too sick to do anything else they will be at my bedside reminding me about our adventures.Like the time we went to Paris. How we ended up at a beautiful cocktail bar in the middle of the afternoon after a long lunch. Another customer remarked that we sounded like we were having a lot of fun and asked me what we were celebrating. After an embarrassing moment, I told her we were celebrating life.Helen's list for living: 1) Live in my own house (almost done), 2) Move to the country (almost done), 3) Get a dog, 4) Play a netball game, again, 5) Recover from chemo on a ridiculously perfect beach (done), 6) See penguins in the South Pole, 7) Go to Paris by Eurostar just for lunch (done), 8) Visit Pompeii and drive along the Amalfi coast, 9) Explore the ancient ruins in Rome, 10) Snorkel on a coral reef, 11) Trek in Nepal, 12) Go to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, 13) See the Northern Lights, 14) Ride a camel across a desert, 15) Drink a mojito in Cuba, 16) See Stonehenge at sunrise (Done), 17) Go into space, 18) Get married, 19) Get my book published, 20) Present a BBC Radio 4 programme, 21) Hold an exhibition of my cow photographs, 22) Do voluntary work, 23) Run a 5K, 24) Skydive, 25) Go gliding, 26) Ride a horse through Hyde Park, 27) Try kite surfing, 28) Zoom down a zip wire (done), 29) Surf somewhere hot, 30) Go coasteering somewhere cold, 31) Take a speed boat down the Thames, 32) Swing on a trapeze, 33) Fly in a hot air balloon, 34) Take a private jet over London, 35) Fly in a stealth airplane, 36) Be driven very fast around a race track in a sports car (done), 37) Sleep under the stars, 38) Get a tattoo, 39) Have a henna crown painted on my baldy head once the hair falls out, 40) Grow my hair long, again, 41) Be a model and work the catwalk (done), 42) Learn to play poker, 43) Pull a pint in a proper pub (done), 44) Hold a party in a castle, 45) Go glass-blowing (done), 46) See puffins in UK, 47) Swim with sharks, 48) Sail alongside a pod of dolphins at sea, 49) Catch fireflies in a jar, 50) Drink champagne in one of the best bars in the world just before Christmas to celebrate still being alive.Helen Fawkes shares her list for living on BBC World Service at 08:06 GMT (09:06 BST on) on Monday 14 OctoberFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>Acts of kindness provide glimmers in government shutdown gloom</description>

      <body>Thousands of workers sent home, cancer patients denied new drugs and weddings postponed. But the way some individuals have responded to chunks of the US government closing down has lifted the spirits, says Tom Geoghegan.The sight of Chris Cox pushing a lawnmower across Washington's National Mall, a chainsaw hanging from it, was one that warmed the heart of many."If they shut down our memorials, we're still going to take the trash out, we're going to clean the windows, we're going to cut the grass, we're going to pull the weeds, we're going to do the tree work,'' he told a Washington radio station.Cox, who made the trip from South Carolina and was carrying the state flag, says his "memorial militia" crusade was non-political, merely an attempt to keep the area between the Lincoln and World War II memorials tidy before thousands of veterans are due to attend an event on Sunday.His wasn't the only act of altruism to emerge from the wreckage of the partial shutdown. On the same day, the military charity Fisher House announced that it would pay more than $500,000 (£313,000) to cover the death benefits denied to five bereaved families. And a philanthropist billionaire has thrown a lifeline to a pre-school education programme called Head Start, to the tune of $10m.When Adam Brown and Joy Miller learned that their wedding venue in Yosemite National Park was off-limits, a caterer in San Francisco stepped in to supply food while other businesses provided a venue and all the trimmings. "We feel so blessed and honoured that strangers have given so much to make our wedding a reality," Miller told CNN.People all around the world act more altruistically for the common good in times of emergency, says moral philosopher Peter Singer, in circumstances that range from something like this to war and famine. But philanthropy has a strong tradition in the US and there's something distinctly American about the idea that individuals can take over the functions of government."Like the guy mowing the lawn in Washington, the idea that somehow people can step in and you don't really need government, you can do it by charity," he says.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Yeti classic among Doctor Who trove</title>
      <description>The discovery in Nigeria of nine lost episodes of 1960s Doctor Who includes the classic story The Web of Fear, in which Patrick Troughton's Doctor battles robot yeti in the London Underground.</description>

      <body>Nine missing episodes of 1960s Doctor Who have been found at a TV station in Nigeria, including most of the classic story The Web of Fear.The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground.Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World.It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades."It's thrilling," said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who."Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible."The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s.However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes.In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos.The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive.Mr Morris said: "The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria. I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who. When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special."He said it had been a "lucky" find given the high temperatures in the African country. "Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition."Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive. The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story.Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever. Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered.Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday.The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97.One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm.Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield.Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton).The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea.The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system."It's the quintessential Doctor Who story," said Gatiss. "It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location."He said it showed Troughton "at the height of his powers".Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret.The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers.Recalling Troughton's "wonderful sense of humour" on set, Watling said: "We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle. We had a chemistry and I think it showed."How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? "I couldn't quite believe it. There had been hoaxes before. I thought it was just another hoax."Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991.Hines said: "This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork."The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.</body>

"So when Radio 1 goes and is taken away from you, a huge bit of your arsenal goes.""It's your main oxygen to get your stuff out there."Radio 1 failed to put Williams' number one single Candy on their playlist last year, but his recent collaboration with Dizzee Rascal did make it on the air.The star's new swing album, Swings Both Ways, is unlikely to be a fixture on the station.Radio 1's breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw previously said Williams, 39, was "not relevant" to his target audience of 15-29 year olds."I liked Take That when I was little, but I'm not little anymore," he told Five news."I don't know if he's now for a Radio 1 audience."The station's head of music has also said rock groups Green Day and Muse may have outgrown the station."The last Green Day project simply wasn't good enough," George Ergatoudis told trade magazine Music Week.Muse, meanwhile "are approaching a crossroads" - their last single was the first one not playlisted by Radio 1 in a decade."The door remains open to them but we'll have to think carefully about their next album."'Over-sensitive'Speaking to John Wilson, Williams admitted he was jealous of the younger pop stars who are guaranteed airplay, including One Direction's Harry Styles."He's talented, he's good looking. He could have it away," said Williams."And I'll be sat here saying 'damn him'.But, he continued, "everybody who's anybody has been competitive and over-sensitive and a bit silly"."Look at Paul McCartney, look at Elton John. They're jealous of Justin Timberlake. I'm sure they were jealous of me when I was in my imperial phase."The Mastertapes series looks at a classic album in depth - in this instance Life Thru A Lens, Williams' debut record.Released in 1997, the album featured the hit singles Angels and Let Me Entertain You.In the wide-ranging interview, he discussed how the album was recorded in the depths of the alcohol-fuelled depression that followed his exit from Take That.Co-writer Guy Chambers recalled how Williams was often "too drunk to make it" to recording sessions."We were often trying to get him to do the vocal for Angels," he said. "That went on for weeks."Williams also revealed that he could no longer take to the stage without a lyric sheet, after forgetting the words to Angels on a live edition of The X Factor in 2009."It caused a chink in the armour," he admitted.The third series of Mastertapes will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in November.Other guests include David Crosby, discussing his solo debut If I Could Only Remember My Name, and Soul II Soul, on 1989's influential Club Classics Vol 1.Edwyn Collins and Natalie Merchant also take part.Recorded at the BBC's Maida Vale studios, each artist also plays live tracks from the album under discussion.Mastertapes: Robbie Williams A-Side will be broadcast on Monday, 11 November at 23:00, the B-Side programme will follow on 12 November at 15:30.</body>

      <body>Hit US TV series Glee has paid tribute to cast member Cory Monteith, who died in July, in a special episode entitled The Quarterback.Monteith, who died of a drug overdose, played high school football star Finn.Set three weeks after Finn's funeral, the show made no mention of the character's cause of death, but focused on how his friends cope with the grief.Kevin Fallon, writing in The Daily Beast, called it "classy, cathartic, heartbreaking, and a gorgeous homage"."Endless credit... is due to the team that orchestrated The Quarterback, because admirable restraint was shown in not milking a cautionary tale out of Monteith's unhappily ever after," he wrote.But the Washington Post's Hank Stuever disagreed: "It was disappointing to see them [the writers] set aside one of Glee's lasting attributes - cold honesty - as it awkwardly and even sanguinely avoided revealing how Monteith's character died."It came across as a bizarre absence of basic plot in a show that built its reputation on deftly locating comedy in the most uncomfortable personal details."The episode showed characters including Kurt, Puck, Santana and Sue Sylvester dealing with their grief in a variety of ways - although Quinn - a previous onscreen girlfriend, was notably absent."Perhaps it is best to think of Thursday's broadcast as a labour of love, and to presume it worked best for those who are most devoted to the show and its often heady blend of musical flash, after-school-special preachiness and high-and-low humour," wrote Robert Bianco in USA Today."It's almost impossible to do a story about the death of a teenager that doesn't induce tears, particularly when the plot is tied into the real-life loss of a well-liked young actor. One just wishes the writers had put a bit more trust into that natural response, and not tugged at our heartstrings quite so strenuously," he continued.The final act saw Monteith's real-life fiancee, and onscreen girlfriend, Lea Michele, perform Make You Feel My Love, which Fallon called "a testament to her own strength".Monteith had been on the show - about a group of high school misfits who form a singing club - since it began in 2009. The Emmy award-winning show is now it its fifth seriesThe Canadian actor, 31, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room.Last week, a coroner's report concluded that he had died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol. Monteith had previously talked frankly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager.</body>

      <body>Actor Craig Bierko, who replaced Bertie Carvel in the role of Miss Trunchbull in the Broadway production of Matilda, has bowed out of the role for 12 weeks.Bierko was originally scheduled to begin performances in the show on 3 September, but delayed his start by two weeks, citing a shoulder injury.A statement from the press office earlier this week said the injury had been "aggravated during performance".Bierko was nominated for a Tony for his leading role in 2000's The Music Man."Craig Bierko will be taking a 12-week disability leave from the production," the press office said. "At this time, understudies Chris Hoch and Ben Thompson will be playing Miss Trunchbull."Bierko, whose film credits have included the Oscar-nominated 2005 film Cinderella Man and 1996's The Long Kiss Goodnight, took over the role of the tyrannical, hammer-throwing headmistress from Carvel, who originated the role in the London production earning an Olivier award.Bierko's most recent Broadway appearance was in the 2009 production of Guys and Dolls. He has appeared in a string of small screen hits including Ally McBeal and Sex and the City.He was also cast as Dave Lister in the pilot for the US version of Red Dwarf, but the series was never made.Based on the Roald Dahl book about a girl with magical powers, British hit Matilda opened to rave reviews in New York in April.It premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Courtyard Theatre in November 2010 and later transferred to the West End's Cambridge Theatre, where it continues to run.The show, whose music and lyrics were penned by comedian Tim Minchin, was nominated for 12 Tonys this year - winning four - as well as a special Tony honour for the four girls alternating in the title role.</body>

      <title>Alice Munro wins Nobel Literature Prize</title>
      <description>Canadian author Alice Munro wins the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature, making her only the 13th woman to receive the award since its inception in 1901.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24477246</url>
      <date>1381409500</date>
      <body>Canadian author Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called her a "master of the contemporary short story".The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901."I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," Munro told Canadian media.Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000).Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway.Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win."She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added.Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950.She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time.Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award.In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements."I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents," she once said in an interview with Book Lounge.BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been "at the very top of her game since she started"."Very few writers are her equal," he said, adding "she gets to the heart of what it is to be human"."I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers."The award "probably won't make a commercial difference" to the author, he added, but it "makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"."If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission."Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.The Nobel academy praised her "finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism".Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was "terribly surprised" and "delighted".Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as "one of those pipe dreams" that "might happen, but it probably wouldn't"."It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course," she added.Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario.Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize.Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway.In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review.Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last."Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be," she told Canada's National Post.In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition.Notoriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events.According to American literary critic David Homel: "She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours.Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize.Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.</body>

      <body>A printing mix up led to early copies of the latest Bridget Jones book having a chunk of Sir David Jason's memoirs in the middle.About 40 pages of Sir David's My Life were printed in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, both of which came out on the same day."The printers have had a Bridget moment," said publishers Vintage.It said it was recalling the misprinted copies and replacing them with correct versions."A printing error has been detected in some of the very early copies of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy," said a Vintage spokesman."Copies printed on one day have given readers an accidental preview of David Jason's autobiography."Both Fielding and Sir David's book were published on what the publishing world has dubbed "Super Thursday", when publishing houses put out some of their highest-priority titles for the Christmas market.Among other books released are Jennifer Saunders' autobiography Bonkers, My Life in Laughs; Mo Farah's Twin Ambitions and John Bishop's How Did All This Happen?Mad About the Boy signals the final chapter of hapless "singleton" Bridget Jones's diaries.Fans may already know one of the significant plotlines after extracts were earlier published in the Sunday Times Magazine.Although Fielding herself approved the reveal, some fans were shocked to be told of such a major twist before the book had even been published.</body>

      <title>Bacon painting could make $85m</title>

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud is expected to sell for at least $85m (£53m) when it is auctioned for the first time in New York next month.The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered to be one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces.It will have its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's from 13 to 18 October during Frieze Art week.A smaller, preparatory triptych of Freud sold at auction for £23m in 2011.Three Studies for a Portrait of Lucian Freud, painted in 1965, had been expected to sell for between £7m and £9m.Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's, Europe said the Three Studies of Lucian Freud, completed four years later, was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation"."It is an undeniable icon of 20th Century art and a painting that Bacon preserved as one of his favourites."Outred said the first public unveiling of the complete painting in London was "quite a moment"."The work is a very important international painting but it's also a conversation between two masters who happen to be British."It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added.Bacon and Freud met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s.Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire.With its sunshine yellow background, it is an "extraordinary piece of paintwork" and one of only two existing, full length triptychs of Freud.The other, painted in 1966, was last seen in 1992, according to Outred, "but no one knows where it is".Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated for almost fifteen years in the mid-1970s.One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled in their original splendour.The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999.According to the curator Martin Harrison: "Bacon was deeply distressed when the triptych was dismantled, noting on a photograph of the left panel that it was only 'a fragment of a triptych… and I think it is meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.'"Its reassembly into the form he intended would, if he lived to see it, have caused him profound satisfaction, given that this was among the surprisingly small number of his paintings he held in high regard."</body>

      <title>Mandela film to get royal premiere</title>

      <date>1381423998</date>
      <body>The film based on Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, has been chosen for this year's Royal Film Performance.Luther's Idris Elba plays Mandela in the biopic, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last month.The film tells of the former South African President's rural upbringing and the 27 years he spent in prison.Organisers of the performance said they were "thrilled" to be able to host the royal premiere on 5 December.Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is directed by Justin Chadwick and stars British actress Naomie Harris as Mandela's second wife Winnie.It charts Mandela's early life as a lawyer, his political activism and the 27 years of imprisonment that preceded his democratic election in 1994.Early scenes in the film show him as a womaniser who was violent to his first wife Evelyn.Speaking in Toronto in September, Elba said the film shows "both sides" of Mandela's character - "the good and the bad".The internationally revered anti-apartheid campaigner, now 95, was released from hospital in September after three months of treatment for a recurring lung infection.Barry Jenkins, the president of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund, said: "We are thrilled to be able to host the Royal Premiere of this momentous South African/British co-production."She said the fund was "most grateful to the Royal Family for their continued support" of the charity.The Royal Film Performance is the main fundraiser for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), the trade charity for the UK film and television industries.It provides care and financial help for industry employees and their families who suffer from hardship due to bereavement, illness, redundancy or other misfortunes.The film will be released in UK cinemas on 3 January, 2014.</body>

      <title>Katzenberg: My $75m Breaking Bad bid</title>
      <description>The CEO of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg, reveals he offered to pay $75m for three new episodes of hit series Breaking Bad to form part of a pay-per-view TV experiment.</description>

      <body>Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, has revealed he offered to pay $75m (£47m) for three new episodes of Breaking Bad.He told Mipcom TV festival in Cannes that he wanted to air the hour-long episodes online, in six-minute chunks.Mr Katzenberg hoped the subscription service would prove the "greatest pay-per-view television event for scripted programming anybody's ever done".Hit AMC drama Breaking Bad came to a dramatic finale earlier this month."There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that millions of people would have downloaded those episodes," said Mr Katzenberg of his attempt to prolong the show's life beyond its five seasons.Elaborating on the unsuccessful Breaking Bad pitch, Mr Katzenberg told The Guardian newspaper: "My idea was literally that you'd pay 50 cents a day for 30 days, so it would be $15, and I actually think there are 10 million people around the world that would have done that."That's $150m, so the $75m I was prepared to pay would have delivered a 100% return on investment. And I'm trying to get people to think about this space in a new way by telling that story. It's emblematic of an opportunity coming."While giving Mipcom's keynote speech, he told TV executives that distributors would continue to pay a premium for high-quality content, whether it lives on traditional television or online.According to The Hollywood Reporter, the DreamWorks chief recently paid $33m (£20.7m) for Brian Robbins' YouTube channel AwesomenessTV, a deal he said is an "enormous opportunity".It currently has 909,000 subscribers and 176 million views and it has spawned a successful Nickelodeon series of the same name, utilising the YouTube content."It gets us directly in touch with the teen audience in a way that movies and TV can't," said Mr Katzenberg.He made the point that younger consumers are not only watching more content online, but are far more engaged with content viewed on touch-screen devices than they are with traditional televisions.Mr Katzenberg said the internet is "a great incubator of talent and concepts" and has the "ability to drive viewers" to television, as it has already been doing with AwesomenessTV.DreamWorks Animation also has a five-year deal to create 300 hours of original "kid-targeted" content for Netflix."Whether the media is old or the media is new, content continues to drive success," said Mr Katzenberg.He insisted films would remain the "heart and soul" of the DreamWorks Animation brand but it would "look like a very different company" in 15 years time.</body>

      <body>Actor and director Simon Callow is to receive an award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at this year's UK Theatre Awards.Callow, 64, made his stage debut at the Edinburgh Festival in 1973.Since then, he has directed more than 30 productions and worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre and in London's West End.He will tour the UK this year in a revival of Francois Billetdoux's comedy Chin-Chin with Felicity Kendal.Rachel Tackley, president of the Theatre Managers' Association said she was "delighted" to give Callow the award."[He] has had a vital and lasting influence on theatre stages all over the country and been a great ambassador for British theatre during a long and illustrious career," she added.Callow is known for his one-man plays, including a version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, The Importance of Being Oscar and Inside Wagner's Head, which he performed earlier this year at the Royal Opera House's Linbury Studio; and The Man Jesus at the Lyric Belfast.As well as stage work, Callow has appeared in many popular films, including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Shakespeare in Love, Phantom of the Opera and Amadeus.The UK Theatre Awards recognise stage productions presented throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Actor Edward Petherbridge, director Sir Jonathan Miller and playwright Sir Alan Ayckbourn are among those up for this year's honours, which will be distributed at London's Guildhall on 20 October.</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

      <body>An Irish primary school has been asked to change the date of a major religious event for Catholic children because it clashes with a pop concert.About 30 pupils at Raheen Gaelscoil in Limerick city are due to receive their First Communion in May 2014.However, a number of the eight-year-olds have tickets for a One Direction concert in Dublin on the same day and some parents wanted the date changed.The school balloted all the families, who voted to keep the original date.The Irish Independent newspaper reported that there were "heated exchanges" during a school meeting on Tuesday night when the parents of three children insisted that the Communion celebrations should be moved to another day so their children could attend the concert.The paper said other parents who attended the meeting were infuriated by what one described as "disrespect shown to the blessed sacrament".First Communion is one of the seven sacraments of the Catholic faith. Children usually receive their First Communion between the ages of seven and eight and the ceremony is normally organised by their primary school.In a statement, Raheen Gaelscoil (Gaelscoil an Ráithín) said: "Further to requests from a small number of parents to change the planned date of May 24 next for the reception of Holy Communion for the first time for our 2nd Class (Year Two) pupils, Gaelscoil an Ráithín, in order to reach the fairest outcome for all concerned, balloted parents overnight on this matter."The result of that ballot has been overwhelmingly in favour of retaining the original date," the statement added."Staff, parents and children of Gaelscoil an Ráithín look forward to preparing for this very special celebration next May."Tickets for One Direction's three Dublin concerts sold out within minutes of going on sale last month and some have been placed on sale on other websites for more than twice face value.The pop group shot to fame three years ago, after auditioning as solo singers for the ITV talent show, The X Factor.Since then, they have had more than 60 chart-topping singles and albums across the world.They are also the first British band since The Beatles to have two number one albums in the same year in the US charts.</body>

      <body>More than one million people visited this summer's Gromit Unleashed arts trail in Bristol, bringing more than £75m to the city, organisers have said.Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal said 1.18 million people saw the sculptures, based on the famous Aardman animation.The 81 5ft (1.5m) dogs were decorated by artists and celebrities, including Sir Quentin Blake and Jools Holland.Aardman's chairman David Sproxton hopes to set up another project in 2015 involving Shaun the Sheep.Mr Sproxton said everyone at the Bristol-based company had been "bowled over" by the way people responded to the sculptures."Gromit Unleashed is the most successful project we've ever done beyond what we're usually associated with."We keep being asked 'what's next?' and it's certainly going to be a challenge to top this."The project partners are keen to see if we can scale up the idea with Shaun the Sheep in 2015 and roll it out nationally - or even internationally."Mr Sproxton said the project was at an exploratory stage but, with 2015 being the Chinese Year of the Sheep, it seemed like the "perfect time".The Gromit sculptures, which each weighed about 90lb (40kg), were on show in and around the city from 1 July to 8 September.They went to auction on 3 October, and raised over £2.3m for the Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity.A total of 92 lots - which included an additional 11 3ft (1m) Gromits weighing 33lb (15kg) each - made up the fundraising total.Pixar's Gromit Lightyear - based on the Toy Story character - was the star lot, reaching £65,000.Nicola Masters, director of Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, said: "The figures are astonishing but the economic impact is only part of the equation as the project has not only helped bring people to visit this wonderful city, but got Bristol people out to explore parts of the city they have never seen before."The charity said the direct impact of the Gromit Unleashed project was more than £77m, which includes money spent on paid accommodation, travel, gifts and refreshments.Just over half of the visitors were from Bristol, with 42% coming from around the UK and the remaining 2% from overseas, in particular North America, Europe and Australia.Nearly 900,000 visitors came to the city specifically to see the sculptures, it is claimed.</body>

      <title>Tori Amos debuts 'magical' musical</title>
      <description>Singer Tori Amos says it was "magical" to see her long-awaited debut stage musical open at the National Theatre.</description>

      <body>Singer Tori Amos says it was "magical" to see her long-awaited debut stage musical open at the National Theatre.The Light Princess, which Amos co-wrote with Samuel Adamson, is based on George MacDonald's 19th Century fairy tale about a girl who floats in the air.They have given the story a modern twist, examining the impact of grief and sexual awakening on teenagers."Its been a completely inspiring project - it's pushed me," said Amos immediately after the opening night.The American singer-songwriter - whose 13 albums include Little Earthquakes and Under The Pink - has been working on the The Light Princess for more than five years.It had been scheduled to open in April 2012, but was postponed for rewrites at the suggestion of National Theatre boss Sir Nicholas Hytner.Both Amos and Adamson told the BBC the delay had made their writing partnership stronger."Musicals take a long time to get right, the ecology of them is quite delicate," said Adamson."I think it's stronger as a result of the delay and we pulled our socks up, frankly."Staged at the Lyttleton Theatre, The Light Princess is directed by Marianne Elliott, whose theatre credits include War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Like those productions, The Light Princess mixes live action with puppetry and back projection.The story takes place in opposing kingdoms where a princess and a prince have lost their mothers.In one kingdom, Princess Althea - unable to cry - becomes light with grief and floats into the air. In the other, Prince Digby becomes so heavy-hearted that he can never smile and trains as a soldier."There were areas we wanted to pursue that were not in the original fairytale," explained Adamson."Lightness is metaphor for all sorts of things that teenagers of either gender go through."Teenagers of any age deal with drugs and sex and finding out who they are, and we wanted to make sure that within the fairytale context that we addressed all those issues."Amos, who has a 13-year-old daughter, added: "It is a rite if passage becoming an adult - it's really tough whether in your teens or your 20s having to be responsible and to deal with things. These are not easy times."Our biggest challenge was that we had to make sure that a fairytale could work in the 21st century."The role of the 16-year-old floating princess Althea is played by flame-haired Rosalie Craig, who on stage resembles a young Tori Amos.The actress sings and acts, seemingly effortlessly, while upside down or being twirled around in the air."It's something I've learned over time, now it's second nature - it's as big a surprise to me as anyone," she said.Having composed her debut stage musical, Amos isn't ruling out writing another one."Being a writing partnership - which is what I have become with Sam - I wouldn't be hurt if he went off and wrote with someone else. I would understand that," she said."But if I got another crack at it I'd sure like Samuel Adamson along for the ride."</body>

      <title>Banksy 'may abandon commercial art'</title>
      <description>Graffiti artist Banksy, who recently began a month-long unofficial residency painting the streets of New York, has suggested he may abandon art galleries.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24464663</url>
      <date>1381333491</date>
      <body>Graffiti artist Banksy, who recently began a month-long unofficial residency painting the streets of New York, has suggested he may abandon art galleries."I started painting on the street because it was the only venue that would give me a show," the British artist told the Village Voice."Now I have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it wasn't a cynical plan," he said."Commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist.""We're not supposed to be embraced in that way."In a rare interview with the New York publication conducted via email, the self-styled guerilla artist - whose identity remains a secret - appears to regret his commercial success, which has seen celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie paying millions of dollars for his artwork."Obviously people need to get paid - otherwise you'd only get vandalism made by part-timers and trust-fund kids," said Banksy, who is believed to be former public schoolboy Robin Gunningham."But it's complicated, it feels like as soon as you profit from an image you've put on the street, it magically transforms that piece into advertising.""When graffiti isn't criminal, it loses most of its innocence."'Pointless'The premise of his new project is to create a new piece of art on the streets of New York, for each day in October.Entitled Better Out Than In, the public art show promised "elaborate graffiti, large scale street sculpture, video installations and substandard performance art"."I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached.""There is no gallery show or book or film. It's pointless," he said. "Which hopefully means something."However, in some quarters at least, his work appears to have been met with hostility. His first piece - entitled The Street Is In Play - which depicted two boys reaching for a spray can inside an official Graffiti is a Crime sign was defaced and painted over in less than 24 hours.His second and third efforts were met with a similar fate: "I used to think other graffiti writers hated me because I used stencils, but they just hate me."As promised, Banksy - who is living incognito in the US city - also unveiled videos and sculptures as part of the residency.He claimed he had been focusing on sculpture following success with his Oscar-nominated documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop in 2010."I've been learning to make big sculptures out of clay - partly because it's a challenge and partly because after a year in an editing studio I wanted to do something standing up.""It seems to me the best way to make money out of art is to not even try," said the artist, whose works have been physically cut from the concrete they were painted on and sold at auction all over the world."It doesn't take much to be a successful artist - all you need to do is dedicate your entire life to it."</body>

      <description>Julian Assange refused to meet Benedict Cumberbatch while he was preparing to play the WikiLeaks founder on film, a leaked email reveals.</description>

      <date>1381398547</date>
      <body>Julian Assange refused to meet Benedict Cumberbatch while he was preparing to play the WikiLeaks founder on film, a leaked email has revealed.In the letter, sent in January, Assange described Cumberbatch's film, The Fifth Estate, as "toxic" and "distorted".He also urged the actor: "Reconsider your involvement in this enterprise".The Australian whistle-blower has been living at the Ecuadorean embassy in London after claiming asylum a year ago to avoid extradition to Sweden.Released by Wikileaks, his email was written in response to the actor's request for a meeting, something Assange called "a bad idea"."By meeting with you I would validate this wretched film," he wrote."I cannot permit this film any claim to authenticity or truthfulness. In its current form it has neither, and doing so would only further aid the campaign against me."The Fifth Estate received a standing ovation at its world premiere during the Toronto Film Festival last month and is released this Friday 11 October in the UK and in the US next week.It has received mixed reviews from critics, although they have been favourable towards Cumberbatch's performance.Assange did praise Cumberbatch's previous work and said the two would "forever be correlated in the public imagination"."I believe you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film," said Assange"It is based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organisation."The film draws on a memoir by former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website.It also uses material from WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy, by British journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding.Assange continued: "Feature films are the most powerful and insidious shapers of public perception, because they fly under the radar of conscious exclusion. This film is going to bury good people doing good work, at exactly the time that the state is coming down on their heads."It is going to smother the truthful version of events, at a time when the truth is most in demand."As justification it will claim to be fiction, but it is not fiction. It is distorted truth about living people doing battle with titanic opponents. It is a work of political opportunism, revenge and, above all, cowardice."The email was published in full on a number of websites including Variety.In comments accompanying the release of the letter, Assange said the DreamWorks film, directed by Bill Condon, was "a geriatric snoozefest that only the US government could love."WikiLeaks angered the United States in 2010 by publishing hundreds of thousands of classified documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and US diplomatic cables.In June 2012, Assange walked into the Ecuadorean embassy in London when his appeal against extradition to Sweden, for questioning on accusations of sex crimes, was turned down.He denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated, but Britain refuses to grant him safe passage out of the country, leaving him stuck inside the embassy.In January's email Assange warned Cumberbatch: "You will be used, as a hired gun, to assume the appearance of the truth in order to assassinate it. To present me as someone morally compromised and to place me in a falsified history. To create a work, not of fiction, but of debased truth.""Not because you want to, of course you don't, but because, in the end, you are a jobbing actor who gets paid to follow the script, no matter how debauched."Cumberbatch revealed last month that he had considered quitting the movie after receiving the email, which he called a "considered, thorough, charming and intelligent account" of why he should not take part.</body>

      <title>Hanks: Diabetes restricts my choices</title>
      <description>Tom Hanks says he has had to rule out roles which require drastic weight gain following his diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24461214</url>
      <date>1381331430</date>
      <body>Tom Hanks has ruled out taking on roles which require drastic weight gain following his diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes.The two-time Oscar- winning actor has often taken on roles that have required him to manipulate his weight, such as Castaway and A League Of Their Own.But he told the BBC those sort of roles were "a young man's game".Hanks is in the UK to promote sea piracy thriller Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival.He added: "I've talked to a number of actors who have gained weight for roles and - just out of the sheer physical toll on one's knees and shoulders - no-one wants to do it again."I think that's more or less a young man's game. I'm 57 and I don't think I'm going to take on any job - or go on any vacation again - and see to it that I can gain 30lbs."The actor revealed he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes on US TV's Late Show with David Letterman earlier this week.He told Letterman he had been showing the symptoms for some time."I went to the doctor, and he said, 'You know those high blood-sugar numbers you've been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you've graduated! You've got Type 2 diabetes, young man.The actor, who won best acting Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, added: "It's controllable. Something's going to kill us all, Dave,"Type 2 diabetes affects the body by either not producing enough insulin - the hormone that turns sugar into energy - or by resisting insulin.People might get diabetes because of family history, age and ethnic background. They are also more likely to get Type 2 diabetes if they are overweight.Speaking at the Captain Phillips press conference on Wednesday, Hanks said: "Gaining and losing of weight may have had something to do with this because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy."But I think I was genetically inclined to get it and I think it actually and goes back to a lifestyle I've been leading ever since I was seven years old, as opposed to 36."The actor added his diabetes was "part of life" and he felt "just fine".In a later interview with BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz, Hanks said: "I always joke: you've got to maintain the temple. I get regular exercise and I eat right - which everybody should do - and I take certain meds."He said pizza was a key ingredient when he bulked up for roles. "Pizza is the most delightful thing ever invented and it's - for me - diabolically dangerous."Asked about recent developments in the entertainment industry, Hanks said the advent of long-form television had "changed the game"."The time you get to spend with the characters has made it possible to become truly engrossed in really great story telling at home," he said."The economics of making movies and showing them are harder than they have ever been with an audience that can see almost anything they want to any time."Hanks is receiving Oscar buzz for his role in Captain Phillips, which is based on the true story of the 2009 hijacking of the US container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates.The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage.Hanks said he met the real Captain Phillips on two occasions and spent several hours with him to find out the "little details".The film's British director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) said it was a "great honour and privilege" to have his film opening a festival "in a city where a lot of movies are made".</body>

      <title>Saunders reconsiders Ab Fab film</title>
      <description>Comedian Jennifer Saunders says she hopes to get the long-delayed Absolutely Fabulous film off the ground next year.</description>

      <date>1381334185</date>
      <body>Jennifer Saunders says she hopes to get the long-discussed Absolutely Fabulous film off the ground next year.The comedy writer and actress told BBC Radio 4's Front Row that, after years of delays, she may finally bow to pressure from fans."Because everyone's saying 'Why don't you write it?', I'm thinking 'Yeah, why don't I write it?'," said Saunders."It would be quite easy, Joanna Lumley would like it. You know, I might well do it," she continued.Saunders, who played PR Edina Monsoon in the hit comedy series opposite Lumley's magazine editor Patsy Stone, said she felt a lot of pressure to deliver a script that was good enough."Everyone keeps going, 'Oh why don't you do a film? Why don't you do some more?'. And you keep thinking, 'Because the expectation is so high!'"You think 'Well we could really mess it up'. And so, why mess up something that is actually still perceived as being quite good?"But, with her diary currently clear for 2014, Saunders said the film was looking more likely than ever."I'll do something, I've got some little pet projects that I keep tinkering away with," she said."One of them might be the Ab Fab film, I don't know. As we're going into winter, a nice little summertime film seems rather attractive."Saunders recently resurrected Absolutely Fabulous for three special episodes to celebrate the sitcom's 20th anniversary.They were aired on BBC One on Christmas Day 2011, New Year's Day 2012 and in July to mark the London 2012 Olympic Games.Since then, the comedian has seen her short-lived Spice Girls musical open and close within six months.Saunders said she did not know whether Viva Forever!, which was produced by Mamma Mia's Judy Cramer, would ever return to the stage.Front Row's Mark Lawson asked her if she blamed critics for its failure:"I sort of do, yes. People were saying, 'Oh you'd better have your hard hat on because they're going to go for you'. And that was before anyone had ever seen it. So there was that feeling around that they were waiting to give it a bad review," she said."It was such a massive oil tanker of a thing to get going because of all the rights and the music and the orchestrations. And the castings, which are so bizarre, because every part has to be covered by someone else who's already in the cast, and all the dancers and all the rest of it."It's just a massive vehicle. It was an astounding thing to work on."Saunders has just published her autobiography, Bonkers: My Life in Laughs."I probably wouldn't have written it if someone hadn't asked me to write it, that's the truth. I always said I'd never write a book. Dawn (French) has written a book - it seemed like really hard work," she said."It was all Clare Balding's fault. She wrote that terrific book, I went to her book launch and was persuaded by her rather charming editor to have a go. So I did."You can hear the full interview on Front Row on BBC Radio 4 at 19:00 BST on Wednesday, 9 October.</body>

      <body>Philip Chevron, the guitarist with Irish folk-punk band The Pogues, has died aged 56."After a long illness Philip passed away peacefully this morning," a message on the band's website said on Tuesday."He was unique. We'll miss him terribly. Dublin town, and the world, just got smaller," it said.Chevron was treated for head and neck cancer in 2007, but a new inoperable tumour appeared in August 2012.Born Philip Ryan in Dublin, he formed punk band The Radiators From Space in 1976 before joining The Pogues, who became best known for their 1987 Christmas hit single Fairytale of New York featuring Kirsty MacColl.Chevron went on to complement the group's frontman and main songwriter Shane McGowan, writing several of the band's songs, including the popular track, Thousands Are Sailing."Those of us on pogues.com are at a loss for words," the message continued."We all send our sincere condolences to his family. His loved ones are in our thoughts."</body>

      <title>BBC Playlister service goes live</title>
      <description>The BBC Playlister, a new digital service that will allow listeners to pick and tag any piece of music they hear on the BBC and listen to it later, will go live on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>A beta version of the BBC Playlister, a new digital service that allows listeners to tag any piece of music they hear on the BBC and listen to it later, has gone live.BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe claimed the project puts the BBC "at the heart of what is happening now"."The whole essence of radio is to communicate: To be able to say 'I love this song'."Now we can really listen to what [the audience] is into and what they love."The aim of Playlister is to give audiences an easy way to find out what music is being played on BBC Radio networks (and, later, on BBC TV shows) and to listen to it again.From Wednesday, every song played on BBC radio will be made listed on the relevant programme website.Anyone with a BBC account can click an "add this" button to add tracks to a personal playlist, and export them to a outside streaming service, such as YouTube, Deezer and Spotify, where they can be played back in full.The homepage of the Playlister website also lists the BBC's most recently-played songs, as well as the most popular or most searched-for music.Mark Friend, BBC controller for multi-platform radio and music, said the service was "easy to use [and] accessible for everyone", adding that it would "join up your BBC experiences with the music experiences you have on the rest of the internet".The launch comes one year on from the launch of BBC iPlayer radio, which "brought together all of the music and the radio from the BBC into one online product... and transformed the BBC's role in digital music," he said.Following the initial Playlister launch on Wednesday, further developments will include the launch of the same functions within the iPlayer radio app, broadening the Playlister to include number of TV programmes - such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Voice - and the introduction of presenter playlists.The presenter playlist will allow BBC DJs and presenters "to be able to curate their own chosen music and present that to the audience" within the Playlister function."It's about enhancing people's music experience," explained Mark Foster, of Deezer, one of the BBC Playlister's commercial partners."A service like ours has 25 million tracks... being able to use trusted curators, like Zane, is all about building trust, building confidence and helping people navigate through this fantastic selection of music that we have.""The ability to discover music and follow people whose musical taste has really shaped yours is going to add a really level of texture to our services," echoed Chris Maples, of fellow commercial partner Spotify.Playlister "will influence the way we make radio," said Lowe, adding, "the traffic goes both ways; communication between presenters and the audience becomes very direct."Playlister gives the BBC a chance to do that globally, which is a big part of what the BBC's future.""People want to keep up-to-date," added Maples. "What's really cool about this is that I can take the perceived cool of Zane and add it to my playlist."Statistics suggest that last year, more than 26 million people listened to music on the BBC radio network every single week and nearly 50 million watched some music from the BBC."Audiences want an easy way to find out and remember the music they hear on our programmes and to get good music recommendations," said Mr Friend"Playlister presents a huge creative opportunity, not just to the audience, but also to us the programme-makers."</body>

      <body>A British crime author has spoken of his excitement after American network ABC confirmed it is developing a TV drama series based on his books.Isle of Man-based Chris Ewan's five book series, The Good Thief's Guide, follows the adventures of criminal Charlie Howard around the world.The show is being developed for ABC by 20th Century Fox Television.Mr Ewan said: "It is incredibly exiting and the names involved with the project are impressive."Amongst those working on the project are the creator of the hit American show Bones, Hart Hanson and Andrew Miller, executive producer of Secret Circle.They will both write, create and executive produce the show.The Taunton-born author said: "It is in development now and I feel very lucky. This is exciting news for the Good Thief novels and I'm so grateful to have such a talented team working on the adaptation."Each season is set in a new city and centres around one perfect heist that usually turns into a tangled web of lies and double crosses.Mr Ewan has written seven novels and was recently named as the Isle of Man Arts Council's writer in residence for next year's Island of Culture.In 2011, he was voted one of America's favourite British authors by a Huffington Post poll.</body>

      <title>Robin Thicke ad ruled 'too sexual'</title>
      <description>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) rules.</description>

      <body>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has said.The ruling was made after 97 complaints about the ad for Beats Pill speakers, which features scantily clad women.The ASA said while it accepted some viewers might find the ad distasteful, it would not cause widespread offence.However, it ruled the "overall tone" was sexual.The advert, which is based on the controversial music video for Thicke's song, shows three female models dancing and interacting with the product while dressed in hot pants and crop tops.It also features one woman kneeling on her hands and knees with a Beats Pill laid on her back.Those that complained said the commercial was sexist, objectified women and was degrading to women.Others said it was inappropriate at a time when children would be watching.In its response, Beats Electronics International said the advert was not intended to be offensive or encourage any inappropriate stereotypes, saying the women were confident, self-assured individuals who were "not subservient to the male character".It added the dominant images were of the product being used as dumbbells, a hotdog, binoculars and medicine, which were "strong, playful images that most viewers would not see as having any sexual connotation".In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged some viewers could find elements of the advert distasteful - "particularly the shots of the women's bodies with their heads obscured and the shot of the woman on all fours".It said as the shots were brief, it did not consider the ad - when taken as a whole - showed any sustained, overtly sexual or provocative behaviour.However, it concluded the overall tone was sexual and was not suitable for broadcast before 19:30.The unrated video for Thicke's Blurred Lines - in which the female models appeared topless - was branded misogynistic and banned from YouTube earlier this year.A second version of the video, featuring the women in the same outfits they wore in the Beats Pill advert, later replaced the original.</body>

      <title>What next for the National Theatre?</title>
      <description>Why the NT's Nicholas Hytner is a hard act to follow</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24046638</url>
      <date>1381457261</date>
      <body>As the National Theatre makes preparations for its 50th anniversary celebrations this month, the search has been on to find a new artistic director who will replace Sir Nicholas Hytner.Sir Nicholas, who has been in the job 10 years, announced in April that he would be stepping down at the end of March 2015.An announcement about his replacement is expected "in the autumn".Nick Starr, the theatre's executive director since 2002, also announced he would be leaving the NT during 2014.There has been no shortage of speculation as to who might take on the biggest job in British theatre.Among the most well-known names who have been mentioned are ex-Donmar Warehouse bosses Sam Mendes and Michael Grandage, and theatre and film directors Stephen Daldry and Danny Boyle and Sir Kenneth Branagh.Others include former Royal Court artistic directors Ian Rickson and Dominic Cooke, and Chichester Festival Theatre's Jonathan Church.Could the job go to a woman for the first time? War Horse director Marianne Elliott, Thea Sharrock, former artistic director at London's Southwark Playhouse and Gate Theatre, and new Donmar boss Josie Rourke, among others, have been mentioned as potential candidates.But several have already ruled themselves out of the race.Sam Mendes, whose Charlie and the Chocolate Factory musical opened in the West End this summer, admitted that while he was "interested", he had not applied."How can you not be interested? It's the most amazing job," he told The Stage in June. "But it's a simple thing for me, and if I run the National Theatre I can't direct movies. It's no more complicated that that - I love directing movies as well as plays."It was later announced that Mendes would be directing his second James Bond film after the success of 2012's Skyfall. Mendes also returns to the National Theatre this autumn to direct Simon Russell Beale in King Lear.Meanwhile, Michael Grandage - who took over from Mendes at the Donmar, leaving in 2011 to form his own company - confirmed that he would be "uneasy" with the public side of the role and wanted to stick with directing."I didn't apply," he told Mark Lawson in the Guardian. "A member of the board contacted me and said they had seen lots of pieces in the papers saying that I wasn't interested and was that right? I said it was right."So what are the challenges ahead for whoever takes over the top job? BBC News has been asking key players in the theatre world what they think.The National's next artistic director will have to "redefine" the role of the theatre and should not try to mimic Nicholas Hytner's success, according to Richard Eyre, who ran the National Theatre from 1988-1997."It's always difficult to follow a great success in any sphere whether it's in business or sport or the theatre," Sir Richard told the BBC at the recent launch of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Stephen Ward, which he directs."There's no question that Sir Nick Hytner has had a golden period as director of the National, and I don't envy the person who is stepping into his shoes but I think that anybody who takes over is going to have to redefine the work of the National Theatre."It wouldn't work if you you just try to mimic the successes of Nicholas Hytner," he added."In theatres, policy is not so much a question of ideology, it's a question of who you choose to work with - the writers, the directors, the designers and the actors - and the audience, you hope, will stay loyal."Marianne Elliott, the Olivier-winning director of National hits War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, has ruled herself out of the race, saying she would find it difficult to take on the role as a mother."I wouldn't apply - it's not for me," she told the BBC in June, on the opening night of Sweet Bird of Youth at the Old Vic."It's a very particular job that requires a very particular person. I love directing and I love being in the rehearsal room and I love time at home with my child. I think for a mother to do that job is quite a big ask."Her latest job at the National is directing the Tori Amos musical The Light Princess, which opened this week."I think it's got to be run in a different way and whoever takes over has got to find their own way," said Rufus Norris, who recently directed The Amen Corner at the National."One of the principal challenges is going to be following Nick, because he's such an extraordinary leader and director and a one-man encyclopaedia on all things to do with British theatre."Norris said that the new person in charge would also have to develop the audience and the cultural mix and gender balance within the organisation.He also noted the drop in public funding meant that money was having to be found elsewhere."I imagine that is only going to continue," he said."In a time of financial difficulty it is hard to argue that a theatre like this should get increase upon increase. It hasn't argued that, but it does mean that money has got to be found somewhere if the organisation is going to continue to be at the cutting edge of English-speaking arts in the world.""It's been the most extraordinary 10 years that Nick's had at the National, and it's gong to be a very hard act to follow," said Jonathan Church, artistic director of regional powerhouse Chichester Festival Theatre.Church is currently overseeing a £22m redevelopment project, which has seen main house productions relocated to a giant tent in a nearby park."One of the things that I love here is that we we create theatre for six months, it's a hive of activity, and then we plan the next six. That rhythm's very special. The demands of the National are very different."Would he be interested in the job? "It's going to be a very good field and wouldn't it be lovely to get the phone call and be asked to be part of that discussion, but it's a long time away and there's a theatre to finish here."Theatre and opera director Jonathan Kent, who formerly ran the Almeida Theatre, would like to see somebody from a different age bracket take over at the NT."I think it should be someone of a different generation - somebody in their 40s," he said."It's quite a hard remit, but it's also a wonderful job. Whoever it is has to be the face of theatre."What both Nicks [Hytner and Starr] have done so brilliantly is define the role of the NT, but not just by doing endless revivals but by being extraordinarily adventurous and casting their nets incredibly wide. I think anybody who didn't follow that would be foolish."Donmar Warehouse director Josie Rourke said whoever took on the role needed an ability to understand the National's responsibility to other theatres."If the National Theatre is in great shape, then theatre in general tends to be in good shape," she said."What's been brilliant about Nick is that he's been very clear that is a role where you talk about regional theatre and the impact of local and government cuts."His ability to speak out with huge clarity on behalf of everything that's going on in theatre is tremendously important."She added: "We need and deserve this healthy National at the centre of all the work that's made at theatres up and down the country."I think whoever gets that job can expect huge support from other theatres.""I hope whoever gets it occasionally employs some film directors," said Danny Boyle, who directed the sell-out Frankenstein at the National in 2011."It's enormously complicated, isn't it - you're a leading spokesperson for the arts as well as running an incredibly complicated building, you're trying to forge an identity for your work as well as run front of house... it's an extraordinary mix."It's an amazing job really, and a wonderful job. And Nick has made the very bold step of saying, 'I'm stepping down'. You'd imagine that level of success would be impossible to let go of, but he's a very sharp man."Would he be up for the job?"Me? No, they need to appoint someone who knows a bit more about theatre than I do. Up until Frankenstein I hadn't done it for about 15 years. I don't know how they'll do the appointment, but it'll be interesting, so good luck to whoever has a go at it.""I don't think it matters if it's a man or a woman. I just think running a ruddy great huge thing like that is hell on Earth. You've got to be in good health and have a mental capacity the size of the Olympic Stadium," said the Oscar-nominated actress Dame Janet Suzman."I think that Nick is going to be a hard act to follow. Programming and getting the right mix of plays for the National Theatre of Great Britain is a mammoth job. You have to pull in the best of everything and take risks and learn how to deal with the Olivier Theatre."It takes a very particular mind to want to run with public money a public institution. You have to have the right kind of energy and I'm not sure who has that. You've got to do your budgets proper. And you are now a public officer. You can't indulge your fantasies, you must indulge London's fantasies. That's a very different order of things."And maybe at the bottom of it you need a kind of insouciance - a kind of looseness in you which stops you from panicking all the time."Additional reporting by Kevin Geoghegan and Neil Smith</body>

      <title>When Danger Mouse ruled the roost</title>
      <description>David Jason finds out what happened to Cosgrove Hall</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24429892</url>
      <date>1381457414</date>
      <body>Thirty years ago children's cartoon Danger Mouse topped the TV ratings, beating even Coronation Street. But what happened to the legendary Manchester animation house Cosgrove Hall Films, which created the rodent secret agent?Voiced by Only Fools And Horses star David Jason, Danger Mouse was the flagship of Cosgrove Hall Films, based in a quirky studio in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy.Vibrant, surreal and deliciously silly, an astonishing 21 million viewers tuned in to watch it in 1983, a record for a children's programme which has yet to be beaten."I used to race home from school to watch it and tape it," remembers comedian Natalie Haynes. "Then I'd watch the tape over and over again."For other people, there was Top of The Pops, for me there was Danger Mouse. If I had kids, I'd be scared to try and introduce them to Danger Mouse, because what if they didn't like it? I could put up with them being noisy and making a mess, but if they didn't like Danger Mouse, I'd hate them."Danger Mouse - who was joined by bumbling sidekick Penfold, voiced by comic actor Terry Scott, as he took on the evil Baron Silas Greenback - has been shown in more than 80 countries.A curiously British cartoon, it parodied James Bond and was influenced by Monty Python's anarchic humour.The titular hero literally lived down the street from Sherlock Holmes - his lair was underneath a post box next to 221b Baker Street.The show's co-creators Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall say the show was modelled on Patrick McGoohan's 1960s TV show Danger Man.In 2006, Hall told the BBC why he thought Danger Mouse was so successful: "The adults watched because of that kind of anarchy. The kids watched it because they just loved the stories and the absolutely stupid gags."Haynes agrees: "Danger Mouse is based on that purely British humour, like Monty Python, that so lacks any of that London-based cosmopolitan pomposity."The people that made it just set out to make kids laugh. It's just the joyous, innocence of the jokes that I love."Things like the Scottish character called Mac the Fork, who's a snake with a forked tongue and who has a brother called Mac the Spoon, and then there's another character called 'Dudley Poison', why wouldn't you enjoy them?"As for the permanently-terrified Penfold, Cosgrove says: "Mark said to me, 'You know what you've done, don't you? You've drawn your brother'. And bless him he was right. It was pretty close."My brother always wore a suit and he was bald and he wore heavy-rimmed glasses. He worked at the Sunday Express in Manchester and they all started calling him Penfold," chuckles the animator.Danger Mouse was the first international hit for Cosgrove Hall, whose animated series also included Count Duckula; Jamie and the Magic Torch; The Wind in the Willows and Cockleshell Bay.The animation studio was a breeding ground for some of Britain's best animators, says Professor Paul Wells, director of the animation academy at Loughborough University,"One of the most important things about Cosgrove Hall is that they really established Manchester as an important centre for British animation production and of course they spawned other companies like Mackinnon and Saunders (The Corpse Bride) and really helped with the careers of internationally renowned animators like Barry Purves."Purves, who later worked at Aardman Animations, and then on Peter Jackson's King Kong movie, says: "From animators I know at Pixar and Disney... many of them have a great fondness, particularly for Danger Mouse, and they very much enjoy its Monty Python, Goodie-esque type silly, surreal British sense of humour"I know they have it in the back of their minds when they are thinking of their own gags."He also recalls an incident when the Israeli embassy complained about another Cosgrove Hall series, Chorlton and the Wheelies.Brian Trueman, who wrote the script, explains: "We were accused of anti-Semitism because (the witch) Fenella Fellorick had a German talking spell book."On the front of the spell book it should have the magic symbol of witchcraft, the pentagram. But the guy who was making the model found that doing two triangles overlaid on one another was a lot easier to make so he slapped the Star of David on the front of it."He giggles as he remembers: "That brought claims that it was an anti-Semitic show. I think they were reassured that it was absolutely nothing of the kind."Cosgrove Hall's back catalogue also includes Roald Dahl's The BFG; Engie Benjy; and Kenny Everett's animated space adventure Captain Kremmen; as well as several animated episodes of Doctor Who.But Danger Mouse remains its most enduring character.Sir David Jason created his voice, imbuing the masked rodent with a high-handed manner that turned the most innocent of phrases - "Good grief!" - into an instant catchphrase.He also played the show's narrator, a character in his own right who became increasingly exasperated with having to say "meanwhile" as he linked the show's scenes.Sir David, now 73, says: "I was first attracted to Danger Mouse by the standard of character animation - I feel very fortunate to have been a part of the creative process of these two fantastic animators."For their adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, I was originally cast as Rat but I really felt that I wanted to offer them a different take on Toad."As manipulative as he was, I always felt that Toad must have a softer side in order to attract such nice friends and so I tried to make him more of a loveable rogue. Brian and Mark listened to my interpretation and thankfully agreed that I should play Toad instead."We always had such a successful working relationship coupled with such fun which we hope came through in the various animations we made together."Sir David is not the only famous alumnus of the studio - Bernard Sumner of Joy Division and New Order worked there from 1976 to 1979; while The Stone Roses guitarist, John Squire, made models for The Wind In The Willows.The company ran into trouble in 1991 when its parent company Thames Television lost its London ITV franchise and was forced to sell it off.Anglia TV bought Cosgrove Hall but it retained only a handful of staff, and began to shift its emphasis.Chris Bowman, a former executive producer, says they began to create animation for other TV productions, like Postman Pat; Fifi and the Flowertots; and Roary the Racing Car, and saw "a second golden age".They were also entrusted by the BBC to make updated versions of Noddy, Andy Pandy and Bill and Ben.Professor Wells says: "They weren't frightened of taking what you might call iconic children's entertainment vehicles like Bill and Ben and remaking them."The company also created the BBC's first cartoon webcast and made the animated ushers who greeted visitors to the Millennium Dome exhibition in London.In 2008, ITV decided to pull the plug on Cosgrove Hall and sell off its studios.Professor Wells says the company was a bit slow to react to the multi-channel world and the growth in imports of US cartoons like Ren and Stimpy.Those "were a little more excessive, a little more adult, looking at a teenage crossover market, and Cosgrove Hall didn't react efficiently enough."When the old Cosgrove Hall studios in Chorlton closed in 2010 dozens of former workers, including Purves, turned up to say goodbye.Hall died of cancer, in 2011, aged 74.By then the studios had been demolished, to make way for retirement flats.But it appears the story is not quite over.Last month, it was announced that Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Entertainment was moving into a business park in Didsbury, Manchester, and taking on 40 animators and graphic designers, with plans for a further 70 jobs.Listen to Crikey DM! David Jason's tribute to Cosgrove Hall on BBC Radio 4 at 10:30 BST on Saturday 12 October. Or catch it later on the BBC iPlayer.</body>

      <title>Romeo and Juliet gets classic revamp</title>
      <description>Julian Fellowes updates Romeo and Juliet for a new audience</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24442185</url>
      <date>1381377956</date>
      <body>Academy award-winning screenwriter and Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is renowned for his period dramas.For his latest project, he has adapted one of Shakespeare's most celebrated love stories, Romeo and Juliet.Fellowes' version is the latest in a string of adaptations of the famous tale and follows Baz Luhrmann's successful 1996 update, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes.Where Lurhmann's film captivated teenage audiences with its contemporary style, Fellowes' update, directed by Carlo Carlei, seeks to take a "different approach" more akin to Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 classic, narrated by Laurence Olivier."That was the last one in medieval costume and filmed against the walls of the castles of Italy," says Fellowes, whose update is set in the northern city of Verona."That did seem a long time not to have revisited it in film in the traditional storytelling, romantic context."But Fellowes has been criticised by Shakespeare experts for rewriting certain passages and altering the language used in the Bard's work.He rejects the criticism, saying the film was never intended to be a straight adaptation of the original."When people say we should have filmed the original, I don't attack them for that point of view, but to see the original in its absolutely unchanged form, you require a kind of Shakespearian scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on."I can do that because I had a very expensive education, I went to Cambridge. Not everyone did that and there are plenty of perfectly intelligent people out there who have not been trained in Shakespeare's language choices."Film producer Ileen Maisel chose Fellowes, who won the best screenplay Oscar for Gosford Park in 2002, to write the script as she wanted someone who could "update Shakespeare's language and story while staying true to its poetic cadence and compelling plot lines".Fellowes adds: "We wanted [a wider group] to enjoy a version of Romeo and Juliet much more than they would expect to."That was our goal, to allow them to enjoy the great beauty of the speeches, but at the same time to tell the story in a way they could follow and wouldn't feel alienated or left out," he says.The cast features the young Oscar-nominated American actress Hailee Steinfeld as Juliet alongside Douglas Booth - the British model and actor who gained acclaim for his portrayal of Boy George in the 2010 BBC Two drama, Worried About the Boy.Homeland star Damian Lewis and Oscar-nominated US actor Paul Giamatti add further international appeal as Lord Capulet and Friar Lawrence.Booth says the film's Italian setting and sumptuous costumes helped its authenticity, also aided by the fact the acting protagonists are close in age to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.Fellowes adds Steinfeld's youth "is a tremendous bonus in the film". She was 15 at the time of filming, two years older than the original Juliet."We intended from the start to get an actress who was as young and who could reasonably play her," he explains."There is something about real youth as opposed to Max Factor youth that is very moving."With first love - when it blots out everything else - when the protagonists are very young, you can believe that disproportionate reality of love that seems to transcend everything else in your life. I feel that's what Hailee gave to us."Booth says the element of youthfulness was one of the reasons he wanted to be involved in the film."The chance to play Romeo doesn't come along every day and the chance to bring this to a new generation was tempting."It's terrifying at first as it comes with a whole load of baggage, but it was a challenge and that's why I wanted to take it on."I wanted to take that baggage and throw it out the window and start fresh with the character."By us being younger, I thought it would bring a different take on the film, an innocence that had not been done before."Before Romeo and Juliet, Booth appeared in Fellowes' From Time To Time alongside Dame Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall, before landing the role of Boy George in the BBC's drama."Playing Romeo was completely different to Boy George, but at the same time you have to find the human core of who these people are," he adds.Booth credits Lewis and Giamatti with being "inspirational" on set, particularly Giamatti for helping to create a realistic, tender relationship between Romeo and the friar.Fellowes says he wanted Friar Lawrence to embody a surrogate, paternal role, particularly as Lord Montagu doesn't have much of a look in."There is a kind of gap in Romeo's back story of an adult who loves him and I think Lawrence fits that very naturally."Where the relationship between Juliet and her nurse, played by Lesley Manville, is pretty faithful to the original - caring and comedic in equal measure - Fellows saw the friar as a "slightly odd character" whose motives for intervening in the young lovers' lives are "difficult to understand"."I did feel that if we could find in the character a genuine affection for Romeo and a desire for his happiness - and beyond that a desire for his marriage to make the community happier and to end the dispute that is ruining everyone's lives - then his involvement would become more logical and easier to understand."Romeo and Juliet is released in UK cinemas on Friday 11 October.</body>

      <title>The band who opened a record shop</title>
      <description>Is this Britain's hardest working band?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24437766</url>
      <date>1381284402</date>
      <body>When indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings released their second album this summer, they were so alarmed by the lack of record shops in which to sell it that they decided to open their own."We were coming to the completion of our second record and the main story on the news one day was the fact HMV had gone bust," says singer Frankie Francis."At the time, a couple of local record shops had gone bust as well. We thought 'We've got this record coming out, but there might not actually be anywhere to sell it on the High Street.'"So we thought we'd take a stand and open our own record shop."With help from Sunderland City Council, the band took over the empty tourist office in their home town. "There's no call for it any more, for various reasons," Francis says solemnly.Pop Recs Ltd was only supposed to open for two weeks to mark their album's release in June. But the band say the reaction has been so good that they are keeping it open for as long as they can and have plans for in-store gigs through to next February.Four out of the five bandmates work there full time and, last month, the venture earned them the title of hardest working band in Britain from the Association of Independent Music.When I visit, the lead singer is manning the coffee machine, busily grinding beans and frothing milk as the shop fills up before an in-store gig by visiting Manchester band Dutch Uncles.Drummer Dave Harper and bassist Steve Dennis are behind the counter in a state of harangued dishevelment - passing coffee cups, jabbing the till, fetching supplies, pausing to chat to friends.Indie circuit stalwarts, Frankie and the Heartstrings made the top 40 with their debut album in 2011 and have a loyal live following, but are still waiting for that breakthrough to the big time."We're a band with not much money… and we've put what money we have into this project just to show bands can take a stand," Francis says."If we can do it on a street level, why can't people further up in the music business be as proactive as us?"We're engaging with loads of bands and labels to come and do things and because of that we're selling records in Sunderland for all these bands. That wouldn't have happened if this project didn't exist."But does it really matter whether we have real record shops selling real records any more? "I guess it matters more to us because we're in a band and we know how many records people sell," Francis replies."Even 10 years ago you would have sold double, three times, four times the amount of records that you sell now."I think it's very important to engage with people and make them realise the value of actually owning music, especially on vinyl because we're very romantic in that we take a lot of time over the artwork and the way it's laid out and the way the whole thing feels and looks."We just want to try and make that connect with people and explain to them why it's such a cherished item."A few months ago, Francis was simply a flamboyant indie rock front man. Now, he talks about business plans and the deals he has struck with various record labels."We're five kids from Sunderland who have been messing around in the back of a van for five years touring the world," he says."It's quite easy to slip back into the crazy gang mentality, but we've had to put our businessmen heads on."The group's second album missed the top 40 and they are now between record contracts. With minimal money to be made from album sales, mid-ranking indie bands must find other sources of income.Dutch Uncles are critical favourites but their three albums have not troubled the top 40. Singer Duncan Wallis says the idea of making money from selling records just does not occur to bands such as his."It's just not something you really consider," he says. "You only think about the money to be made out of touring, at this level anyway."Frankie and the Heartstrings say they have sacrificed summer festival fees in order to work in the shop, which earns them "enough to get by, and that's all we care about".The alternative would be much worse - getting proper jobs."The shop, if you maintain it correctly, could become an income for the band," Francis says. "If it wasn't for the shop we would all have to be in work now."Until now, the band have survived on the money they have made from their music. When a pizza company used one of their songs in a TV advert, the group lived for a year on the proceeds.Francis says: "I don't think there's any shame in that any more because you don't make any money from selling records, so you've got to make an income somehow."In the store, the band also sell their own coffee blend and brand of beer, and Francis admits they make more money from coffee than records most days. Like many other independent record stores, they know they cannot survive by selling music alone.Work by local artists and photographers adorns the walls and there are dedicated racks promoting records by local bands."We've had kids from the local area who've come into the shop, bought some records and the next week they've come in and said, 'We've just started a band, can we have a gig in here?'" Francis says.But the most prominent space is reserved for the new album by Frankie and the Heartstrings.The singer laughs: "If we're going to run a record shop, we're going to be number one in the charts every week in this store."</body>

      <description>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.</description>

      <body>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.The National Secular Society (NSS) says some groups are holding assemblies and bible clubs in schools in England.The NSS has written to the Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for national guidance on external visitors, particularly from religious groups.The government said it had not seen any evidence to support the claims and had not received any complaints.The report says there has been "a marked increase in the number of parents contacting the National Secular Society with concerns about external visitors to schools exposing their children to unwelcome and wholly inappropriate religious evangelism and proselytisation".It added: "We have investigated this and found an abundance of material showing that the parents' concerns were not isolated instances."The report says that in many cases, evangelical Christian organisations offer to provide religious education and school worship.It claims that the legal obligation on schools to provide religious education and a daily act of worship has provided "a foot in the door" to some organisations with evangelistic intentions.The report suggests that shortfalls in religious education provision, recently highlighted in a report from Ofsted, are leading head teachers to accept help from external religious groups and adds that some heads are "insufficiently discerning about the external groups they are allowing into their schools".The letter also asks the Department for Education to ensure that guidance to schools on visits from religious groups "makes clear that schools must not offer opportunities to groups seeking to evangelise".The NSS says its investigation was prompted after it was contacted by parents, some of whom had themselves written to the schools and to the Department for Education about their concerns.One parent said he had become aware "quite by chance" of regular visits by an evangelical group to his child's non-religious primary school in Sheffield.He complains that the group "adheres to a profoundly conservative and avowedly missionary agenda".Another complained that his child had been told the creation story from Genesis was "factual" during visits to a primary school in the West Midlands from a local minister.Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "Religious education must be clearly delineated as such."A line is crossed when religious positions such as creationism are taught as scientific theories for example. Neither are schools places for proselytisation without the explicit and informed consent of parents."A spokeswoman for the DfE said if parents had concerns about visitors to their child's school they should make a formal complaint to the school."State schools cannot teach creationism as scientific fact," added the spokeswoman."They must offer a broad and balanced curriculum and meet their obligations under equalities legislation. Schools have a responsibility under law to ensure children are insulated from political activity and campaigning."Schools are required to safeguard the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils."Ofsted inspections include a focus on this to enable them to identify any inappropriate practice."</body>

      <title>Thousands of teenagers fail three Rs</title>
      <description>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a GCSE C-grade in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a C-grade at GCSE in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.And most who do not get a good grade in these key subjects by 16 then drop them.The figures are revealed in new government statistics.From now on, all teenagers will have to continue studying maths and English if they do not get at least a C-grade.The statistics, which have been published for the first time and are described as "experimental" by government officials, show that in 2009-10, about one in three young people (220,000) had not gained a grade A* to C in English by the age of 16.Of these, about 34,000 (15%), went on to re-take the GCSE after 16. About half of those then got at least a C.The figures are similar for maths.Schools minister David Laws said: "English and maths are what employers demand before all other subjects - if young people want to get on in life, they must be able to show they have good literacy and numeracy."These figures expose the vast number of young people allowed to give up these subjects after so nearly achieving the level employers demand."With just a bit more teaching, these students could have achieved the grades that would make all the difference to their job prospects."The figures come days after a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said literacy and numeracy rates of England's 16- to 24-year-olds were among the lowest in the developed world.Among 16-year-olds in England, only six in 10 achieve the government's minimum target of five good GCSEs including English and maths.Under changes introduced last month, teenagers now have to stay in some form of education or training until they are 17, although this may be work-based.This is due to rise to 18 in 2015.Ministers say they are writing to 12 local councils who are not tracking whether 16- to 18-year-olds are in education or training.New figures show that nationally, 88% of 16- and 17-year-olds were in education or training in June, up 1% on 2012.But the government said there were differences between areas and some councils were poor at tracking what many teenagers of this age group were doing.</body>

      <title>Inspectors attack prison education</title>
      <description>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised the standards of education and training in England's prisons.</description>

      <date>1381407494</date>
      <body>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons.The watchdog says it is unacceptable that not one prison has been rated "outstanding" for education in the past four years and only one in three is rated "good".At Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, Ofsted chiefs said if the figures related to schools there would be a "national outcry".Ministers say reforms are under way.In a speech at the prison, Matthew Coffey, national director of further education and skills at Ofsted, said the aim of training and education in jail should be to make people less likely to go back to crime when they got out."This year's annual lecture aims to focus on how we can reduce the high re-offending rates that are nearly 50% for adult prisoners and 72% for juveniles," he said."The aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons through better employer engagement and better teaching and training."Levels of education among prisoners are generally much lower than in the population as a whole.Some studies suggest half of men in UK jails and nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have no qualifications at all, while about half have literacy skills below that of most eleven-year-olds. Many have been expelled from school.Mr Coffey said: "Far too many prisoners leave prison without employability skills, meaning they are less likely to find a job. Research shows that being in employment is one of the key factors that can reduce the risk of re-offending by between 30% and 50%. However, examples of good training provision in prisons were all too scarce."Clearly, reducing the number of those re-offending is in everyone's interests. Every prisoner costs the taxpayer the same as sending a child to Eton, around £34,000 per year. We must now focus on improvement of prisoners' vocational and employability skills to ensure we support them on their journey out of prison and into employment to break the cycle of re-offending."He added that there were "outstanding examples" of prisons working with employers, education providers and other bodies to help prisoners develop vocational skills, but that those examples, were "all too scarce".Education in prisons in England and Wales is provided by private bodies which bid for contracts.Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Re-offending rates have been too high for too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated and managed in the community."We are committed to improving education in prison and are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency to develop prisoner learning."In most countries in the European Union, only about one in four adult prisoners takes part in education, according to a report for the EU published earlier this year, out of 640,000 inmates.In England and Wales, the proportion is higher, with an estimated 42% receiving some kind of prison education, which has to be provided by law.The EU report said prisons were all too often "environments for negative learning" when they could be offering people a second chance.According to the University and College Union, which represents many prison teachers and trainers, the "constant re-tendering" for education contracts brings problems, including a high turnover of staff and instability.They say because providers are paid by results, some teachers feel under pressure to limit courses to certain offenders and those in for longer terms.</body>

      <title>Free school head teacher, 27, quits</title>
      <description>A 27-year-old head teacher whose appointment to a new central London free school was criticised has quit the post, the school says.</description>

      <body>A head teacher whose appointment to a new free school was criticised has quit her post weeks after starting.Pimlico Primary, which opened in September, said Annaliese Briggs, 27, had left the job to "pursue other opportunities in primary education".Miss Briggs was appointed in April as the head while still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education.Labour councillors in Westminster said governors may be regretting appointing someone with "no teaching experience".The primary school opened at the site of Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, central London, with 60 pupils and aims to have 420 pupils by 2019.Pimlico Primary is sponsored by Future Academies, a charity founded by Lord Nash and his wife Caroline.A statement from Pimlico Primary said: "Having successfully set up Pimlico Primary, Annaliese Briggs has decided to leave Future Academies to pursue other opportunities in primary education."A new principal of Pimlico Primary has been appointed. Coming from within the group, our new principal is already known to the pupils and families of Pimlico Primary, and brings over 10 years' experience in both early years and leadership."We are delighted that Annaliese will continue to support Pimlico Primary as it grows by becoming a governor."Miss Briggs is completing a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) course in Wandsworth and will qualify with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).She previously said she has classroom experience from teaching primary school children in supplementary schools and had been chosen to lead the school for her curriculum expertise.Reacting to the news that Miss Briggs has stepped down, leader of the Labour group at Westminster Council Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg said: "Being the head of an inner-London school is a tough job which can sometimes be very stressful."By appointing someone with no teaching experience or experience in running a school, the Pimlico academy governors might now consider that this is a decision they now regret."I hope that Ms Briggs' commitment to education is undiminished and wish her well in her future career."The Department for Education said it was a matter for the school.</body>

      <description>Training teachers to deliver classes in body image improves the self-esteem of teenage girls, a UK study shows.</description>

      <date>1381372584</date>
      <body>The self-esteem of teenage girls could be improved by training teachers to deliver classes in body image, a UK study shows.In the pilot study, 261 teenage girls at three secondary schools were given a course of six lessons on body image.This had significant effects on their body image and self-esteem compared with the regular curriculum, say psychologists at King's College London.As many as one in three teenagers say they are dissatisfied with their body.Poor body image has been associated with depression, eating disorders, overuse of cosmetic surgery, obesity and unhealthy weight loss behaviours.Dr Helen Sharpe and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry developed a course on positive body image for teenage girls.The six-part programme focused on ideals of beauty, unhealthy interactions with peers - such as "fat talking", or making negative comments about weight - and practical measures for boosting mood and self-esteem.The course was delivered by teachers in three state-funded girls' schools.Dr Sharpe told the BBC: "We have tested whether a series of lessons being delivered by teachers to students in school are helpful in improving body esteem - we found this was the case."She said the research, published in The British Journal of Psychiatry, showed promise in being able to tackle problems caused by low body esteem, such as eating disorders."We're hopeful that as we continue with this research we'll be able to make the programme even more effective and that it could then go on to be effective in reducing disordered eating - things like binge eating and unhelpful weight loss," said Dr Sharpe.Interventions delivered by teachers would have wide reach and be of minimal cost, said the researchers.Some schools were relying on programmes that were not evidence-based and could be harmful, they added.Last year, MPs recommended that all schoolchildren should take part in compulsory body image and self-esteem lessons.An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image heard evidence that more than half of the public had a negative body image.Girls as young as five now worried about how they looked, the MPs' report said, while cosmetic surgery rates had increased by nearly 20% since 2008.</body>

      <title>Pupils 'not fed enough at school'</title>
      <description>Some children are not being given enough food at a county's schools leading them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member warns.</description>

      <body>Some pupils are not being given enough food at Powys primary schools causing them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member has warned.Montgomeryshire AM Russell George said parents and governors had told him 11-year-olds were being given the same portion sizes as four-year-olds.He claimed second helpings had also been banned and he intended to raise the issue with Powys council's leader.The authority said its meals met Welsh government requirements.Mr George said the issue was brought to his attention by a number of people across the county who he said felt the "extreme" school meals policy was leading to more snacking and bad dietary choices.He said the policy dictated that all primary school children received the same portion of food, regardless of age.And he said he had been told that second helpings of lunch had been stopped as the council tried to reduce waste."Parents are telling me that their children are coming home hungry, which then causes them to snack before their evening meal, all of which isn't lending itself to children leading healthy lifestyles," said the Conservative AM."Children of 10 and 11 years of age are clearly going to require different levels of nutrition to those of four and five-year-olds... this isn't rocket science."One chair of governors at a primary school in the county claimed more parents were switching their children to packed lunches because they no longer felt the school meals were offering value for money.He said he became concerned after noticing his own 10-year-old son was coming home from school hungry and that a number of other parents had raised the issue with him."I then raised it at a governor's meeting and was told that catering staff had been told that as of the start of this term additional food was not to be given," he said."I have spoken to the principal catering officer at the council and he said the rationale behind this was that he felt some schools were over-producing food."Also I think the thought is that by giving children seconds they're not going to have the balanced meal they should be getting."But what follows from that is that if you get wastage down to zero you have pupils going hungry as the portion sizes are the same for four to 11-year-olds."He said teachers were concerned that it was leading to poorer concentration from some pupils."The council's saying that all the pupils should get the same portion sizes as everyone pays the same but I think it's leading to some parents feeling that they are no longer getting value for money and are giving their children packed lunches instead," he added.A spokesperson for Powys council said dishes on school menus met the requirements of the Welsh government's Appetite for Life scheme, which aims to improve the nutritional standards of food and drink served in schools across Wales."As part of this scheme, there are recommended guidelines regarding the size of the portions. These portions have been analysed to ensure they meet the nutritional standards set out in the scheme," the spokesperson said."When planning school meals, the number of pupils who have school meals is always taken into consideration to ensure that school cooks do not over produce food and remain within their budgets."However, there will always be cases where food is left on the servery as pupils can choose whether they want a particular food on a school menu."If there is food left over, we have now advised school cooks to give out second helpings if there are pupils who want it."But we cannot overproduce food so that second helpings can be provided as this has a cost implication and also second portions are not taken into consideration when the menus are nutritionally analysed."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We would never want to see children having school meals going hungry."We've given primary schools guidance on portion sizes which cater for changing nutritional requirements as children get older. So a child in year six would have a larger portion than a child in reception."</body>

      <title>University regulation 'inadequate'</title>
      <description>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission says.</description>

      <date>1381281659</date>
      <body>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) says.The HEC says current checks are not adequate for a sector that has a new funding system in the wake of higher tuition fees introduced last year.It says the situation could threaten the UK's higher education reputation.The government says a "robust but proportionate" regulatory system is needed.The HEC - an independent body made up of leaders from the education sector, business and the three main political parties - conducted its research over an eight-month period and concludes that current regulation is too "piecemeal".The commission says that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes the teaching grant to universities, was previously able to attach regulatory conditions to the grant.But now that the teaching grant has been reduced and is being replaced with increased student tuition fees since 2012, the ability to regulate universities through Hefce has been reduced in turn.Its report - Regulating Higher Education - says all degree providers in England should be "captured" by proper regulation.It says: "It [higher education] is a valuable part of our national infrastructure and we must therefore ensure that students investing thousands of pounds in their futures are receiving top quality provision, and that the institutions they are attending are financially viable."The HEC study expresses particular concern about newly established higher education providers, saying "more providers are entering the market... and online providers gaining traction"."Regulation as it sits is not adequately prepared for the diversity of these current and future developments."New market entrants are not facing the scrutiny they should, takeovers and complex corporate structures are being used to evade fundamental protections for students, and institutions are facing more pressure than ever to recruit students and crucially, therefore, bring in funding."The report continues: "In this new, reformed higher education landscape, the chances of an institution failing are increased. An institution failing would damage both students and the highly-valued brand of UK higher education."The HEC calls on the government for urgent legislation to tackle the problems.It suggests an overarching regulatory body - the Council for Higher Education (CHE) - should be created, incorporating the current body Hefce, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the Student Loans Company and a new body called the Office for Competition and Institutional Diversity.The commission also calls for better information about the various degree providers now operating in the UK and says all of these should be subject to a new regulatory framework, with kitemarks for those meeting approved standards.It also proposes an insurance scheme, paid into by every institution, to safeguard students should an institution or course fail.Professor of government at Hull University and HEC inquiry co-chairman Lord Norton of Louth said: "Regulation is fundamental to the health and success of our HE sector and will make or break the effectiveness of the institutions that have made the UK a world leader in higher education."In the context of current reforms, the absence of legislation to provide a coherent regulatory architecture for the rapidly changing and increasingly dynamic sector is creating major headaches for its players."It is a situation crying out for urgent rectification by government, a refrain that was a constant throughout the course of the inquiry from those who gave evidence."Fellow co-chairman and former vice chancellor of Lincoln University Prof Roger King said: "Our proposals seek to build upon the existing regulatory strengths displayed by the sector and to ensure that more external and formalised external regulatory arrangements work with these."Above all, however, we need to urgently address the outstanding requirement for a more systematic and less piecemeal approach to the external regulation of the sector. This can only be achieved by early legislation by government."A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: "It is essential that there is a robust but proportionate regulatory system in place to protect students and the reputation of the wider sector."At the same time though a balance must be struck to protect institutional autonomy and academic freedom. These elements are key to the success of our university system."When the time comes for legislation we want to get it absolutely right."Prof Les Ebdon, director of Offa, said: "I believe that fair access is too important to be rolled up within the wider concerns of a multi-focused regulatory body."An independent director, with a sole focus on access, can challenge institutions to set themselves stretching widening participation targets and ensure that fair access remains high on the agenda, both for institutions and policy-makers."</body>

      <title>Oxford challenges tuition fee limit</title>
      <description>Oxford University's vice-chancellor questions the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.</description>

      <date>1381255629</date>
      <body>Oxford University's vice-chancellor has questioned the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000.He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price".The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton.He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees."Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural."It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access."A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall.But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students.Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs.He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000."That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation."Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors.The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades.Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms.But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions.How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals?Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn).A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn).Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history".Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election."However, higher university fees are not what this country needs."Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%."However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <body>The mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly, should be released from jail, the Parole Board has said.She was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum term of five years, in May 2009, for causing or allowing her son's death in north London.A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case.The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final.A statement from the board said: "We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly."Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release."Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse.He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months.Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence.Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death.Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term.He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year.When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim.Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account.Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody.Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman.</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>England lags on young adult literacy</title>
      <description>Young adults in England and Northern Ireland have performed poorly in international tests of literacy and numeracy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24433320</url>
      <date>1381339350</date>
      <body>Young adults in England have scored among the lowest results in the industrialised world in international literacy and numeracy tests.A major study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows how England's 16 to 24-year-olds are falling behind their Asian and European counterparts.England is 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries.The OECD's Andreas Schleicher warned of a shrinking pool of skilled workers.Unlike other developed countries, the study also showed that young people in England are no better at these tests than older people, in the 55 to 65 age range.When this is weighted with other factors, such as the socio-economic background of people taking the test, it shows that England is the only country in the survey where results are going backwards - with the older cohort better than the younger.The study shows that there are 8.5 million adults in England and Northern Ireland with the numeracy levels of a 10-year-old."This shocking report shows England has some of the least literate and numerate young adults in the developed world," said Skills Minister Matthew Hancock."These are Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations."Ministers in England have announced a new maths qualification for 16 to 18 year olds as part of a drive to improve numeracy and its requirement that maths should be studied until the age 18 for those who do not have a good GCSE in the subject.The newly-appointed shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt defended Labour's record."Labour drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010."He said a future Labour government would "ensure all young people study maths and English to 18" and would not allow "unqualified teachers to teach in our classrooms on a permanent basis".Young adults in Northern Ireland performed better in the OECD tests than in England, but they were also in the bottom half of these rankings.The highest-performing countries among this younger age group were Japan, Finland and the Netherlands. The country with the lowest numeracy skills was the United States, plummeting from once being one of the strongest education systems.This landmark study from the OECD set out to measure the level of skills within the adult population - testing actual ability in literacy, numeracy and digital skills, rather than looking at qualifications.It involved 166,000 adults taking tests in 24 education systems, representing populations of 724 million people. From the UK, adults in England and Northern Ireland participated.The study looked at the level of skills across the adult population, between the ages of 16 and 65. England and Northern Ireland are below average for both literacy and numeracy, in league tables headed by Japan and Finland.But for most industrialised countries the younger population are much better at such tests than the older generations.Mr Schleicher pointed to the examples of Finland and South Korea where there had been huge progress in recent decades.A statement from the Finnish embassy highlighted that this was about a long term commitment to improving schools."This demonstrates that there is a longer trend in the Finnish education success, it is not just something that has happened in recent years."However, for England, when the results are separated from Northern Ireland, there was a different and unusual pattern, with almost no advance in test results between the 55 to 65-year-olds and those aged 16 to 24.This younger group will have many more qualifications, but the test results show that these younger people have no greater ability than those approaching retirement who left schools with much lower qualifications in the 1960s and 1970s.The grandchildren are not any better at these core skills than their grandparents.Mr Schleicher says it might suggest evidence of grade inflation and it shows that better qualifications do not necessarily mean better skills."When you look at this snapshot you do have to conclude that these young people are not any better skilled when it comes to those foundation skills than people in the older generation," he said.He warned of the serious economic implications of a failure to provide a skilled workforce.The influential OECD expert showed how there was an increasing demand in the jobs market for those with higher skills - and a static or falling jobs market for those with lower skills.England and Northern Ireland have particularly high levels of adults with the lowest skill level in literacy and numeracy.The economic and social rewards for having high skills are particularly strong in England and Northern Ireland, says the research, with significant advantages in health, job opportunities and income.The global economic race is strongly linked to educational performance and the OECD report shows how the UK's share of the highest skilled workers is falling.An even sharper decline is faced by the United States, an education superpower of a previous generation. Last year the OECD warned that the US was almost the only developed country facing educational "downward mobility", where the younger population is less well educated than the older generation.This latest study shows that the US once had 42% of the world's highest-skilled adults but this had now fallen to 28%.Mr Schleicher set out the scale of the difference in ability, saying that many secondary school pupils in Japan were ahead of graduates in England.Neil Carberry, the CBI's director for employment and skills, said the UK's economic future depended on improving the skills of the workforce."This survey simply emphasises that the UK cannot afford to stand still on skills."Ian Brinkley, director at the Work Foundation think tank, said the study showed the UK faced a "relative decline in the economy's skills base"."We face a major generational challenge."</body>

      <title>Too many pupils 'failures at seven'</title>
      <description>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, says a report from Save the Children</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24434515</url>
      <date>1381194837</date>
      <body>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, a charity has warned.Save the Children analysed 2012 data on the performance of pupils at schools in England.It shows the poorest pupils are less likely to have made good progress than their better-off peers.The charity's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: "Many children starting school this term already have the odds stacked against them."In his foreword to the report, he writes "Seven is too young to write off a child," but he adds that without good reading skills "all other subjects are a closed book".The report cites official figures that suggest that by the age of seven the future gap in GCSE results between rich and poor children has already been established.In 2012, about 13% of seven-year-olds, or 76,000 pupils, were not at the expected reading level.Underlying this figure is the achievement gap between children on free school meals and their classmates. Almost a quarter (24%) of children eligible for free meals did not reach the expected level, compared with only 10% of children from better-off families.A different set of figures from the 2012 National Pupil Database shows that fewer than a sixth of pupils who had fallen behind at the age of seven caught up to meet the benchmark of five GCSEs graded A* to C at the age of 16.This suggests that 84% of children who fail to meet expected standards in reading and mathematics at seven are likely to continue to struggle throughout their school careers.The authors recognise "steady and welcome progress" over the past five years on the number of seven-year-olds who can read and write to the expected level.Their analysis has found that even continuing to make this rate of progress between now and 2020 could still leave almost half a million children having fallen behind in their reading by the age of seven.They add that continued progress may be difficult to achieve so even these figures may be optimistic without "bold policy change".Calculations based on lower rates of progress suggest that between 520,000 and 810,000 children could have fallen behind by 2020.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "It is utterly unacceptable that so many disadvantaged children leave primary school without a firm grounding in the basics of reading, writing and maths and that is why we are urgently reforming primary education and giving specific support to disadvantaged pupils."This included the pupil premium paid to schools to support poorer pupils, the phonics test and the "rigorous new primary curriculum" which would mean that "many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers."Save the Children is launching a programme called Born to Read, aiming to help about 23,000 children in England to read over the next four years.</body>

      <title>Reeves promoted in Labour reshuffle</title>
      <description>Tristram Hunt is to replace Stephen Twigg as shadow education secretary and Rachel Reeves replaces Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary.</description>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The two new members of the shadow cabinet, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, as well as Ms Reeves, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <title>Threat to close Muslim free school</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is warned to "urgently" improve "unacceptable" standards or face closure.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-24440529</url>
      <date>1381249780</date>
      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby will be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improve and discrimination against female staff and pupils stops.In a letter to the chair of the Al-Madinah Education Trust, Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues.These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff.The interim principal said its pupils were treated equally. The school's trust said it was seeking legal advice.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted.When asked if staff and children are treated equally at the school, Dr Wilson replied: "Yes, they are treated equally and fairly."The Al-Madinah School Education Trust said in a statement on the school's website that "the letter had come out of the blue" and while it intended to co-operate fully with the Department for Education, it would also be speaking to the school's solicitors.Lord Nash's letter stated if urgent steps were not taken by 15 October, funding will be pulled.The school was closed for a week on the first the day of an Ofsted inspection on 1 October citing "health and safety issues".Ofsted released its statement to "clarify media reports" about why the school had closed.In it, HM Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: "Inspectors discovered that staff records showing whether they were cleared to supervise children were either missing or incomplete."The school remained closed until yesterday [Monday] when inspectors made a return visit to satisfy themselves that the necessary safeguarding arrangements were in place and that there were sufficient numbers of adults with the necessary clearance for the school to function safely."A full Ofsted report is expected soon, he added.Addressing chair Shazia Parveen, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement," he added.He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October for nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23977422</url>
      <date>1380669333</date>
      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23261289</url>
      <date>1374016582</date>
      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23197565</url>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

      <description>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, claims a union.</description>

      <body>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, a union is claiming.A third (32%) of support staff in UK state schools polled by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) said they took classes for absent teachers.Over a fifth (22%) said they took more classes in 2012-13 than in 2011-12.A Department for Education (DfE) spokeswoman said: "The rules are clear - they should not be teaching."The DfE said teaching assistants and other classroom support staff played a vital role in the classroom, short of teaching whole classes of children."The government's recent review of school efficiency showed that, when properly trained and deployed, teaching assistants play an important role in helping to improve learning," the spokeswoman said."It is for school leaders to use the expertise of all staff to ensure any disruption to pupils is minimal and that taxpayers get value for money."The ATL polled more than 1,400 of its members working as support staff in state schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.A spokeswoman for the union said the rules allow classroom assistants to teach small groups of children under the supervision of a qualified teacher, but they should not teach whole classes or prepare teaching material.Higher level teaching assistants may contribute to lesson planning and deliver lessons to whole classes to assist an assigned teacher, while cover supervisors are employed to supervise classes while pupils complete work set by a teacher.A quarter (25.4%) of the teaching assistants and learning support workers surveyed and almost half (49.1%) of higher level teaching assistants said they were asked to cover lessons.Of the 400 who said they stood in for the regular class teacher, 60% said they did the same work as fully qualified teachers, claims the union, while a third (31%) of these staff said they had been used to take classes for three or more consecutive days.The union quotes a higher level teaching assistant at a secondary school in England: "I prepare, teach and mark at least four lessons for two year-7, bottom-set classes, and a year-8 set for at least three hours a week. It is teaching on the cheap."A cover supervisor said: "I have even been asked to give copies of lessons I have prepared to members of teaching staff."A primary school teaching assistant added: "It is unfair that many teaching assistants are teaching classes in the absence of a teacher, and doing the same job as a teacher for much less money."ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Schools are selling children short by using teaching assistants to teach classes when the regular teacher is unavailable."We are totally opposed to this exploitation of support staff who are being used as a cheap option to teachers."It is grossly unfair on them and on the children and their parents who rightly expect their children to be taught by qualified teachers."</body>

      <title>Muslim school reopens after closure</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby reopens after a temporary closure over "health and safety" concerns.</description>

      <date>1381142999</date>
      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has reopened almost a week after it was closed during an Ofsted inspection.The Al-Madinah School shut last Tuesday, citing "health and safety concerns", after one day of inspections.Sources said the school had been rated inadequate in all areas by Ofsted, but a final report has not yet been filed.The school has insisted it was closed on undisclosed health and safety grounds and not due to the inspection.Sources said Ofsted found incomplete records of child protection checks being done for all staff.There have been reports that female teachers at the school were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim.It was also claimed girls were made to sit at the back of the classroom and boys at the front.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state funded but not overseen by the local authority.National Union of Teachers (NUT) spokesman Nick Raine said: "It is a publicly-funded school - if there are health and safety concerns that were serious enough to close the school then what were they and have they been an issue for some time? "Over the weekend Labour politicians asked Education Secretary Michael Gove to clarify matters urgently "to reassure the public".The Department for Education said it was already investigating allegations against the school.Several parents with children at the school told BBC News that they were happy with the school."I would rather it close and they sort it out and now she can back to school and the health and safety is going to be fine," one mother said.The Al-Madinah school, which opened in September 2012, claimed to be the first free school in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils.But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward.A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur."</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24419852</url>
      <date>1381153697</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24399813</url>
      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <title>Gay adoption 'confusion' for couples</title>
      <description>A gay couple say they had to go to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24416338</url>
      <date>1381123696</date>
      <body>A gay couple have said they went to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.The Court of Appeal ruled that legislation which prevented gay, lesbian and unmarried couples from adopting children in NI was unlawful.It was the only part of the UK where the policy existed.However, Stormont's health minister plans to go to the Supreme Court to try to overturn that decision and get the ban reinstated.John Davis and Jason Scorer, who live in County Antrim, had hoped to adopt children from Northern Ireland, but with uncertainty over the legal position they were advised to consider other options."We were very lucky that our original social worker in Northern Ireland had done a lot of homework before she came, to say that we could not move things any further forward," said John, who has lived in Northern Ireland for 20 years."The problem is a lot of people may not be aware there is another option."They contacted adoption and fostering charity PACT (Parents and Children Together).It helped the couple, who are in a civil partnership, go through the process in England with the aim of giving children from there a home in Northern Ireland."There are children waiting in the system (in Northern Ireland) to find families but, unfortunately, we were not allowed to go down that route," said Jason."And that is to the hardship of the children who are here."They adopted two boys at the start of the summer and they started primary school last month."They are getting loved, they are getting looked after and they are getting cared for," said John.They say they know of other gay couples from Northern Ireland who are now considering going through the adoption process elsewhere in the UK, because the issue is still being debated in the courts.The Department of Health at Stormont confirmed that Health Minister Edwin Poots has now applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision that the ban was discriminatory.And he insisted the issue was about stability not sexuality."Unlike other parts of the UK... we have a strong list of adoptive parents who want to take on adopted children," said Mr Poots."I think we should be cautious about changing the system which actually provides the stability those children need."It is not a human right to adopt a child for either a mixed-sex couple or a same-sex couple."Gay and lesbian groups, as well as organisations like BAAF (British Association for Adoption and Fostering), have criticised the minister's decision to continue fighting the issue in the courts.But he said surveys had shown support for his position."What I look at it is where the Northern Ireland public are on these issues and what is in the best interests of the children," he said."There is a lot of public opposition to it."In Belfast, there were people with strong views on both sides of the argument.Those against gay couples having the right to adopt argued that children needed both male and female role models and some claimed it was against their religious beliefs.However, many said that the only important thing was providing a stable home for a child, irrespective of whether the couple were married or their sexuality."You could argue all day about the gay thing - whether it is right that someone who is gay should be gay," says John Davis."But I believe it goes back to the loving, caring environment and stability that you can give these children, that they have not had up to this point."</body>

      <title>Murdered Keanu 'failed' by agencies</title>
      <description>A serious case review into the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams finds police, social services and health workers "failed" to prevent his death.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-24365700</url>
      <date>1380809518</date>
      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <title>Scouts announce promise for atheists</title>
      <description>The Scout Association in the UK announces an alternative version of their membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24434510</url>
      <date>1381228981</date>
      <body>The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.From January, instead of vowing "to do my duty to God", scouts will be able to promise to "uphold our scout values".The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.The Church of England, the Church of Scotland and other faiths have welcomed the move.The step follows a 10-month consultation."I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish," said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people."In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life."The Right Reverend Lorna Hood, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, also welcomed the move."I am extremely happy that the Scout Movement has taken this very sensible and inclusive step while ensuring that faith and belief remain a vital element of their ethos," she said.This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to "my Dharma" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its "determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society".Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: "Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have."Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive."The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girlsLast month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.A ban on atheist scout leaders will also be lifted.The Scout Association confirmed to the BBC that it would rewrite its equal opportunities policy which currently states: "The avowed absence of religious belief is a bar to appointment to a leadership position."</body>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <title>Corruption and bribery in the classroom</title>
      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24444599</url>
      <date>1381336921</date>
      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>
      <date>1381370654</date>
      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day?Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess?Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy?Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders.On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security.There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen.But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry.The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS.There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy.Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves.Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups.Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area.There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income.Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China.Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers.The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship".The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future.He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do.""There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says.He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics.In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff."You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available."There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives.He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment."This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home."The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning."I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it."It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals.The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away.The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training.The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms.Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus.But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon?On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields.It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats.There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation.Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect"."I don't take too precious a view of that."But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich.When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players.Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change."We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades."There is something powerful in having great seats of learning."</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24228473</url>
      <date>1380236413</date>
      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own. We're learning it and they're growing up with it."Perhaps that is why so many parents look to their children for help when their phone stops working - they've spent 10,000 hours on these devices before they turn 21.</body>

      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has announced plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.Energy Wales would buy gas and electricity at wholesale prices and sell direct to consumers and firms, she told the Aberystwyth conference.Surpluses would be spit between protecting customers and expanding energy efficiency measures.Ms Wood said the firm would work as an arms-length company like Welsh Water."When Labour's energy price freeze begins to thaw and prices begin to spike again, Plaid Cymru would have enabled the building of our cheaper, permanent, people-powered Welsh alternative," she said.In her second annual conference speech since being elected party leader, she said Plaid would recruit 1,000 extra doctors if it won the assembly election in 2016.This would be financed by a sugary drink levy of up to 20p per litre, she said.She also announced radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales over the next assembly term.Ms Wood also announced an "alternative way forward" on hospital reorganisation plans.Labour has accused her of blocking a controversial shake-up of some specialist services without suggesting alternatives.Welsh Labour ministers have insisted closing some hospitals and moving some core services from smaller to larger hospitals are essential to make the NHS safe and sustainable.Some of the most controversial have been in south Wales, with opposition to proposals to move key specialist care from Llantrisant's Royal Glamorgan hospital as part of changes at five health boards.Ms Wood said Plaid was committed to delivering a better Welsh NHS with 1,000 extra doctors."We will provide more doctors so these services can stay open and stay safe," she said.Money would be raised by levy of up to 20p a litre on sugary drinks."If a thousand extra doctors sounds over-ambitious consider this."With them, Wales would only be brought up to the UK average - so we must have those extra doctors."She told party members this would help provide a more efficient NHS, as would plans to better integrate hospitals and social care "to get patients out of hospital and back into their own home".The Plaid leader said funding to begin this integration had already been won as part of a package of measures the party had this week announced with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers in a deal on the Welsh budget.Ms Wood said there was a "crisis of obesity and diabetes that was killing us as a nation."She also unveiled radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales, over the next assembly term.Plaid has said previously Wales can learn from how Norway, Germany and Denmark have offered modern hospital care without centralisation.The party has argued planning the NHS workforce more effectively and better recruitment practices would help reduce some of the strains on the health service.Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru was the only party addressing people's big concerns at the 2016 assembly election and that "Wales is better than this".Ms Wood started her speech by saying Plaid would build on recent momentum.She said this would "carry us forward over the finishing line" to win the assembly election in 2016."It isn't a sprint but a marathon and I'm firing the starting pistol here today."She said she was committed to Plaid being the next government of Wales "so we can build Wales up, turn around the economic situation, stand on our own two feet."Plaid Cymru also points to the budget deal it signed with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers earlier in the week which put more money into treating patients in the community as a way of both improving services and keeping more patients out of hospital.All party members who attend the two-day conference will be able to vote on the motions debated. Until now that was reserved for delegates representing various sections of the party.The change is part of internal reforms brought in following Plaid Cymru's disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election.Ms Wood promoted plans to cut business rates for smaller firms on the opening day of the two-day Aberystwyth event.Firms would qualify for reduced business rates if their rateable values was below £15,000, rather than £12,000 under the current regime.A rateable value below £10,000 would mean paying no business rates, rather than the £6,000 ceiling at present.Ms Wood has also defended her party's election performances since devolution.With the SNP in government in Scotland, she was asked on BBC Radio Wales why the Scottish nationalists had moved so much further on than Plaid."I think it reflects the different settlement that Wales has had compared to Scotland," said Ms Wood."Scotland is so much further ahead in terms of the devolution settlement and Wales is in a different place."Our settlement is much weaker as is our economic situation and that's why I've said since I've become the leader of Plaid Cymru that the economy and job creation should be our number one priority."I would argue that Scotland has got a government that puts Scotland first and Scottish communities first at every opportunity and Wales needs a government now that will do that and I would argue that a Plaid Cymru government after 2016 is what the country needs now."SNP MP Pete Wishart urged Plaid activists to join in with the campaign.To enthusiastic applause, he told the conference: "We will win, because independence is the aspiration...that puts the future of Scotland in the hands of the people who live and work in Scotland."</body>

      <title>Fears autistic pupils 'missing out'</title>
      <description>There are fears some children with suspected autism in Wales are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.</description>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed.Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis.In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis.According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education.But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed.Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties.But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis.His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area."I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn.She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities."When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said."They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space."Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism."I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said."In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well."Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom."It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said."The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas."A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need."We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities."We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD."A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times."The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said."The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner."More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday.</body>

      <title>Greenpeace ship Britons denied bail</title>
      <description>Two of six Britons, including one from Newport, held on piracy charges in Russia after Greenpeace protest at an offshore drilling platform denied bail.</description>

      <date>1381502070</date>
      <body>Two Britons arrested after a Greenpeace protest at an offshore oil drilling rig have been denied bail in Russia.A court in Murmansk ruled that Kieron Bryan, from London, and Philip Ball, of Oxfordshire, should remain in pre-trial detention until 24 November.The pair were among six Britons on board the organisation's boat Arctic Sunrise held on 18 September.Greenpeace has called from the release of Mr Bryan on the basis he was a journalist working alongside activists.All 30 people on the vessel have been accused of piracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.Four earlier bail applications from Russians - including another journalist - were also refused.Freelance video journalist Mr Bryan, 29, appeared in court behind a glass screen, wearing a green checked shirt.Russia's Interfax news agency quoted him as saying he did not have journalistic accreditation and intended to sell his footage after returning from the Arctic."I had just verbal contracts. Verbal agreements with many leading TV companies that I would provide them with footage afterwards," Bryan told the court.Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said the court's decision "flies in the face of all reason".He added: "The decision of the court to refuse bail looks increasingly like the Russian authorities are meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment even before any trial."In the case of Kieron Bryan, he is a professional journalist, travelling on the Greenpeace ship, witnessing a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean."He has committed no crime and should be released immediately."The BBC's Moscow Correspondent Daniel Sandford reports that lawyers for the two men argued that the Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya oil platform is more like an island than a ship, so piracy charges should not apply.Sergey Golubuk, a lawyer for Greenpeace International, said the detainees were denying the charge of piracy - defined by international law as "violent attack with personal gain in mind" at sea.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "All these basic indefensible elements of piracy are obviously lacking in all people on board Arctic Sunrise, without exception."Mr Bryan's brother said his family had not been able to speak to him since his arrest and were finding the situation difficult.The 32-year-old, originally from Shebbear in north Devon, has only been able to contact his family through a single letter, written nearly two weeks ago.Russell Bryan told Today: "Mum and Dad are finding it very hard, and myself as well. We haven't heard from Kieron in almost three weeks now, in terms of phone calls."It's been very hard not being able to speak to him."Kieron is a freelance journalist. He is not a Greenpeace member or a Greenpeace activist. This is not something that Kieron would have anticipated at all."A spokesman for Vladimir Putin denied the Russian President had put pressure on the investigation by declaring on 25 September that the protesters had violated international law.Russia's Investigative Committee has said the charges against some of those detained might change because drugs - thought to be poppy straw and morphine - were found on the boat.Poppy straw, or raw opium, can be used to produce morphine or heroin.The committee also said investigators were trying to establish which detainees were responsible for "deliberately ramming" Russian coastguard boats in the Arctic.Greenpeace said any suggestion illegal drugs were found was a "smear" and "fabrication" as its ships only carry medical supplies required under maritime law.The UK government, meanwhile, has raised the case of the six detained Britons with the Russian authorities.Those being held with activist Mr Ball and Mr Bryan are logistics co-ordinator Frank Hewetson from London, activist Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales, communications officer Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon and 2nd engineer Iain Rogers, from Exeter.</body>

      <title>My future is on line, says Coleman</title>
      <description>Chris Coleman says his career as Wales boss could be decided by their final two World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium.</description>

      <date>1381471768</date>
      <body>Chris Coleman admits his career as Wales manager could be decided by their final two World Cup qualifying matches.However, FA of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford has said Coleman would not be judged "on just two games".Wales face Macedonia in Cardiff on Friday night and Group A leaders Belgium in Brussels next Tuesday."I know there's added pressure, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to perform. My future's on the line," Coleman said.Coleman, 43, who took over as Wales manager after the death of Gary Speed, has a contract until the end of November.A new deal has been agreed in principle but remains unsigned by both parties, with Coleman saying earlier this month he is undecided whether he will sign it.Wales have won just three of their 12 games under Coleman - their last victory was against Scotland in March - and sit bottom of their qualifying group.A win over Macedonia at the Cardiff City Stadium would at least give Wales hope of not finishing bottom of Group A and hopefully gain them a slightly more favourable seeding when the qualifying draw for the 2016 European Championship is made."I said as soon as I walked in the job that I'd never, ever walk away from Wales during a campaign," Coleman added."We've got two games remaining, the next one is massive."Wales are without 10 players because of injury, including captain Ashley Williams, while defender James Collins has been called up after settling his differences with Coleman."It's tough because we're missing a lot of players, we've got a lot of inexperienced players," said the Wales boss."On the other hand, I look at it and think it will be beneficial for Wales that these boys are getting a taste of international football."It'll be a bumpy ride against Macedonia. They've beaten us, they've beaten Serbia, they've drawn with Scotland at Hampden Park, they've lost narrowly to Belgium."They're not minnows any more, not like they used to be, and were seeded higher than us coming into this group."This'll be a real tough game on Friday night, but the boys we've got will get great experience and it's a game we've got to go out and try and win."</body>

      <title>Talks over future of largest mine</title>
      <description>Managers and workers at Wales' largest mine are meeting later to discuss their options after its owners announced they are filing for administration.</description>

      <date>1381488954</date>
      <body>Managers and workers at Wales' largest mine are meeting after its owners said they were filing for administration.The future of the Unity Mine, a drift mine near Neath, has been uncertain after management said they only had work for 66 of its 220 staff.Director Richard Nugent said the firm was "forced into the process of filing for administration" but the workforce is being kept on for now.Business Minister Edwina Hart said the firm was being offered assistance.But she said there were wider financial pressures and challenges which had led to the company going into administration.She added: "However, discussions with third party investors are on-going, and I welcome the director's intention to protect the current work force while fundraising negotiations are continuing with various parties to seek to secure the long term future of the mine and its highly skilled workforce."Wayne Thomas from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said he believes there is a future for the mine.He said: "I think many people who know the investment to date and the infrastructure of the coal mine and certainly those who are aware of the potential reserves for this mine, they would know there's a future for this mine."We believe there's at least 10, 15, 20 years work here. We believe those reserves are attainable."I'm convinced in my mind that a solution can be resolved in the longer term and the sooner we get to that the better."In recent months, the miners were told there was not enough work for everyone.Staff offered to share shifts between all of the workers which meant they got on average a quarter of their previous pay.It was seen as a way of safeguarding the pit's future, but it is understood some workers have had to leave their jobs and taken up posts as far as way as Kent and Manchester.A meeting is due to take place with the mine's 22 apprentices later and the entire workforce will meet next week as administrators are appointed.Blaengwrach community councillor John Price, who sits on the Unity liaison committee, said the announcement was "devastating"."It was a big shock, make no mistake about that," he told BBC Radio Wales."We fully expected it to carry on, on a limited scale until the situation with coal sales improved and then it would revert to normal."But it doesn't look as if it's going to go that way now."He added: "If they can get more investment or be taken over on a buy-out it will be an excellent thing for us."Our MP [Peter Hain] has fallen over backwards in getting licences and planning permissions hurried through Neath Port Talbot council for Unity mine because they applied to work on opencast on top of the mountain to help out with coal coming down from there."Apparently that is all systems go now but then comes along this announcement and it's devastating."Meanwhile, Welsh government officials are continuing to hold talks with the mine's management to try to find a solution.In September 2012 the BBC reported 94% of all Welsh coal came from opencast sites, the remainder from drift mines.The vast majority work was at two pits in the Neath Valley at Unity and Aberpergwm which is currently closed.Unity Mine opened in 2007 with reserves of up to 90 million tonnes of coal.It is a drift mine, which means that miners can walk into it from the surface rather than having to be transported down to the coal seams via a lift in a shaft.Tata steelworks and Aberthaw power station use about 80% of Welsh coal.</body>

      <body>A comprehensive school in south Wales which closed a year ago after asbestos was found will not fully reopen until 2014.Cwmcarn High School, in Caerphilly, is not expected to be open to all pupils until January, but some will return in December.It was was supposed to be open in September but the death of a contractor on the site prevented that.The head teacher called it disappointing and frustrating.In a joint statement on the school's website, head teacher Jacqui Peplinski, and Sandra Aspinall, the council's acting deputy chief executive, insisted the school must be made safe before pupils could return.The school shut in October 2012 over fears its 900 pupils were at risk after the discovery of asbestos. Contractors have been working to remove the substance.But in July this year James Paul, 26, from Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, was working in a suspended ceiling space when he died.The father of one was due to get married next year. It is thought he may have been electrocuted.For the past year pupils have been taught 12 miles (19km) away at Coleg Gwent's Ebbw Vale campus, a move which has been dogged by protestsby parents.Caerphilly council is paying £1m to deal with the asbestos.</body>

      <title>English or Welsh driving test rule</title>
      <description>All driving test candidates to take written theory exam in either English or Welsh after UK government announces a ban on foreign languages.</description>

      <body>All driving test candidates will have to sit the written theory exam in either English or Welsh after a ban on foreign languages by the UK government.The change follows the case of a woman who was jailed at Cardiff Crown Court after she gave dozens of candidates the answers in Mandarin.Driving licences were stripped from 94 people after Allyson Ng sold answers to the written test.Ng, from Bristol, was jailed for a year in August for fraud.Cardiff Crown Court heard she told candidates when to say "yes" on multiple choice questions in the theory section of the driving test.Since 2009 she had interpreted on 123 theory tests and while the majority of the fraudulent tests were in Cardiff, a small number were in Birmingham.Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he wanted all drivers to have the skills to use roads safely and it would also help reduce the risk of fraud by interpreters.At present, candidates who do not speak English or Welsh can ask for pre-recorded voiceovers for theory tests in 19 foreign languages or use interpreters for both parts of the exam.But from April the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) will scrap foreign language help. It said that was backed by most of the 2,000 people who replied to its consultation.Many also said foreign language speakers may not understand road signs or be able to speak to traffic officers.Ng admitted to conspiring to defraud the DSA, the arm of the Department of Transport in charge of driving tests.She was arrested at the Cardiff theory test centre in October 2012.Ng charged £110 a time for translation and the agency said it became suspicious after a surge in her customer numbers in the second half of 2011.</body>

      <title>Energy firm 'out of touch' over rise</title>
      <description>Energy giant SSE is accused of being "out of touch" by Labour in Wales after announcing a hike in gas and electricity prices.</description>

      <date>1381495709</date>
      <body>Energy giant SSE has been accused of being "out of touch" after announcing a hike in gas and electricity prices.The energy giant SSE, which owns Welsh supplier Swalec, announced it was putting up prices by an average of 8.2% next month.But Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said the rise was "breathtaking," given the difficulties customers were facing.The company blamed the rising cost of wholesale energy and the cost of delivering it.SSE also said it had to pay for more infrastructure, for UK government schemes to help those most in need and green levies.Its price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers in the UK.The other big five energy suppliers are expected to follow suit.The UK government said it was disappointed but said greater competition was the long term answer.Labour flicked the switch on the debate when the party promised to freeze energy prices for two years if they won the next general election.Mr Smith said: "It's breathtaking that they can be so out of touch with the difficulty that consumers, electricity customers, gas customers, are experiencing in Wales right now and that, on the back of making record profits last year, they can tell us they need to put up prices by a further 8.2%, having put them up 9% last year."Mr Smith, who was speaking on BBC Radio Wales, said communities and and society in Wales was suffering at the moment and the energy companies were making it worse.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the UK government of "letting energy companies get away with this".SSE's Will Morris said on Thursday he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."</body>

An offer of a 2% wage rise, made earlier in the year, was rejected.MITIE said it had "full contingency plans" and was planning further talks with the RMT.RMT general secretary Bob Crow said it had been a "long fight" for workplace and pay justice and its union members had "shown guts and determination" throughout."Only last week First landed a jackpot rollover with a two-year contract extension on Great Western that will make them and their sub-contractors a fortune," he added."Justice says that now is the time for the cleaners out there day and night on First Great Western (FGW) to get their fair share through a Living Wage, decent sick pay and benefits and an end to the evil of zero hours contracts."The strike will run until 05:59 on Saturday.A FGW spokesman said the firm was working with MITIE, as its contractor, to ensure it met its contractual obligations.The firm operates trains across the Western region, carrying 1.5m passengers every week on 9,000 services and calling at 276 stations.</body>

      <title>Hospital waiting list jump 'crisis'</title>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients waiting more than nine months for hospital care.More than 13,000 in Wales had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of more than 2,000 in one month.Welsh Conservatives say First Minister Carwyn Jones should intervene personally in "an escalating crisis".Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the NHS in Wales had the same challenge as England but "where we differ is the way we respond and deal with these issues".The Welsh government has previously blamed the severe winter weather for pushing up the 36-week waiting time.Its own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives said they recognised the Welsh government had announced extra cash for the NHS in its draft budget announcement this week but waiting times remained "unacceptably long".Shadow health minister Darren Millar has written to Mr Jones saying the situation was "a crisis that needs immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."He added that he sought assurances the NHS delays would dealt with by Mr Jones personally.Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.Health Minster Mark Drakeford said: "We know there are significant challenges in the NHS. These are exactly the same challenges being faced by the NHS in England."Where we differ is the way we respond to and deal with these issues."As a result of our action, 92% of people in Wales are satisfied with the care they receive from the NHS."</body>

      <body>Revellers will receive £75 fines if they are caught urinating in streets and doorways instead of using open-air urinals in Swansea city centre.The council started to provide portable urinals two years ago following complaints by local businesses.The move was welcomed by many traders in Wind Street, which is popular with drinkers, but the problem has not gone away.From Friday, police will start handing out fixed penalty notices."Urinating in public is a major irritation to authorities and businesses who are left to clean up their own doorways and streets after people under the influence of alcohol feel it is acceptable to treat the city centre like a toilet," Ch Insp Dean Thomas said."It is certainly not acceptable and I am pleased the police are able to work with the council in enforcing fixed penalty notices against those caught in the act."The pilot operation between the council and police is aimed at ensuring the public knows urinating in the street will not be tolerated.The council deploys portable urinals every weekend in the city centre at known problem areas and says they are well used.But not everyone chooses to use them, prompting the latest move follow a warning two years ago that anyone caught would be fined or arrested.Bruno Nunes, owner of Peppermint bar and Bambu Beach bar, welcomed the action."The impact of this action will be felt not only by those hit in the pocket, but the many others who will hear about the tough stance being taken," he said.Council cabinet member June Burtonshaw said: "Public urination is a contentious issue that has been troubling authorities, organisations and businesses working together to create a cleaner, healthier and safer city centre."We've tried the soft approach, which has had some effect, but now it is time to get tough. Urinating in shop doorways, alleys, lanes or bushes is not acceptable."There are toilets provided in every night-time venue, as well as the additional portable urinals on the streets. If people still can't control their bladders, they could find themselves with a hefty fine."Similar toilets are used in other UK cities including Manchester, Bristol, Cambridge and London.Wind Street has come under fire in recent months being dubbed "an area of drunkenness and debauchery" and a "magnetic attraction" for drinkers.In response, the council has introduced a policy curbing new pub and club licences in the city centre.</body>

      <title>Concern village could flood again</title>
      <description>Residents in a village in Conwy are worried they will not be well enough protected from flooding this winter despite prevention works.</description>

      <body>People in a village in Conwy are worried they will not be well enough protected from flooding this coming winter.Llanfairtalhaiarn near Abergele was severely flooded in November 2012.The stream that flows under the village - Nant Barrog - overflowed, leaving some homes under four feet of water.Environmental body Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has already spent more than £91,000 to reduce the chance of it happening again.But villagers say some other important work has been delayed because there is not enough money available to do it.Natural Resources Wales says the project will be completed as soon as possible.Geraint Jones, the chairman of Llanfairtalhaiarn Community Council, said: "I understand there are massive constraints on public sector funding at the moment, and there will be for some time."But when people's lives and businesses are concerned, I think it's imperative that they get on and do it."The residents have been very patient up until now - they've dealt with cleaning up their homes themselves."The frustrating thing for everybody is that they don't see things happening quick enough."The work that still needs to be done includes fitting new one-way drains so that if the water does come into the village, it has got a way out.The culvert under the village is still partly full of gravel after the flood and needs clearing out.Mr Jones added: "These works will happen, we understand that, but I believe there are issues with funding and funding authorisation."We are nearly a year down the road, and still waiting for this work to be implemented."Funding is no excuse. When you have an event like this that affects so many people, so traumatically, there should be no question. The work should be designed and implemented as soon as possible."I know for a fact that people will be nervous. They will hear the rain on the windows and the roofs and wonder what's going to happen, because the work that's been promised hasn't happened. "A spokesman for Natural Resources Wales said: "In the past 11 months we have carried out a programme of works to help reduce the risk of flooding for people in Llanfairtalhaiarn."The first phase of this has now been completed and has seen alarms and CCTV installed to monitor the Nant Barrog, and a new debris screen upstream to reduce the risk of the culvert blocking."We've developed a community flood plan and identified flood wardens."All residents at risk have been offered individual property protection products such as flood gates for doorways"The priorities for the next phase have also been identified."So far we have spent more than £91,000 with a further £132,000 of work in the pipeline."The culvert underneath the village belongs to Conwy council which says it is discussing ways of getting it cleared.</body>

      <title>Traders help boost town's market</title>
      <description>An island market is thriving once more six months after local businesses stepped in to help run it.</description>

      <body>A market in an Anglesey town is thriving once more six months after local businesses stepped in to help run it.Last October there were four regular stalls at Llangefni's twice-weekly market but this year there are 30.Organisers say it is due to better management and there is scope to do more.Other businesses are also reporting better trading on market days as more people visit the town.Ian Ault, the chairman of Llangefni Social Enterprise and a cafe owner, said it was great to see the buzz of a large market again."I worked here 35 years ago and I can remember how fantastic the market used to be," he said."I can remember the atmosphere in the town, and the impact that had on the people."Mr Ault bought a cafe in the town six years ago and said he was struck by how many of his customers were disappointed at the way the market - held on Thursday and Saturday - was in decline.He said he jumped at the chance to get involved when Anglesey council approached traders in the town for help."We took it on in April and watched it go from strength to strength and when it was at its peak during the summer we had 37 stalls here."Last year in October there were only four stalls, but today is October and we have 30 stalls."We've got a great mix here too, to appeal to customers."Mr Ault said it was still early days and a lot of work needed to be done."For this to be sustainable then we need people to turn up on market days so that customers know there is going to be a market here."It needs everyone to work together for the benefit of everyone else," he added.Long-term stall-holder Emyr Owen, the new market manager, said:"If you get together a proper mix of quality stalls then customers are going to come back."Business in the town are saying they have improved trading on market days as well."An events organiser has also been employed and Llinos Fon Jones is organising a Christmas fair."The more people we can attract here the better it will be."Llangefni has a great community where a number of people are willing to work for the benefit of the town," she said.</body>

      <description>The body of a man found at a house on Anglesey at the weekend had been there for a very long time, says a coroner.</description>

      <body>The body of a man found at a house on Anglesey had been there for a very long time, a coroner has said.Dewi Pritchard Jones, senior coroner for North West Wales, also said a woman living at the bungalow in the village of Llandegfan was being cared for in hospital.A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, he said, and samples could take six weeks to analyse.North Wales Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious.The man's body was discovered on Saturday. The woman also living there is now being cared for at Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital in Bangor.Mr Pritchard Jones said neighbours had been "expressing concerns to the police and the police thought they had better take a look".He described the body as in a "very poor condition" but refused to speculate how long it may have been in the house.He stressed there was no evidence of a crime but added: "At present we've got no reason to suspect any foul play but we've got no reason to exclude anything either."Establishing the identity of the man beyond all doubt could prove impossible, he said, as the man they believe it to be had no children and no siblings from whom a DNA match might be found.Asked if it was thought the dead man was the husband of the woman living at the property, the coroner said: "We can't say it's the woman's husband's body - that would be a guess."He said three investigations were being carried out - a medical one, one by the police to try to establish who the man was, and a third "to try to establish what on earth was going on in that house"."We've got an awful lot of questions but very few answers," he said.</body>

      <body>Plans for a giant solar park with 180,000 electricity-generating panels are being drawn up for a site in Flintshire.Swansea-based Compton Group has earmarked 90 hectares (222 acres) next to Deeside Industrial Estate for the panels.The company says it could produce electricity for 11,000 homes annually.Compton Group is to hold a consultation later this month before submitting plans to Flintshire council.The proposed site is on land north of the A538 (Weighbridge Rd) close to Shotwick Lake Sailing Club.In January, Anglesey council granted permission for a solar park with 64,000 panels.Plans were agreed for a solar park on 28 hectares (70 acres) of land at Bodorgan Estate which was said to be the size of 28 football pitches.Pembrokeshire became the first council in Wales to grant planning permission for a solar farm at Rhos-y-Gilwen Mansion, in the north of the county, in January 2011.The project on a six-acre site was up and running and connected to the national grid within seven months.A Compton Group spokesman said: "Both the UK and Welsh governments have committed to significantly reducing CO2 emissions and solar parks are vital in meeting these targets and providing a sustainable source of renewable energy that reduces the reliance on fossil fuels."The developers are holding a drop-in session to provide details of the proposals at Quay Building, Fron Road, Connah's Quay, on Wednesday 23 October from 14:00 to 20:00 BST.</body>

      <body>A Flintshire school is leading a £10,000 community history project to research how World War I affected life in the surrounding area.The Heritage Lottery Fund money will enable Mold's Welsh medium Maes Garmon school to commemorate the centenary of the Great War next year.The school is appealing for local people to share memories and memorabilia for the bilingual project.Pupils will also visit museums and archives as part of the project.The school's history department will establish a pupil-led committee to collate research for a community website and a special exhibition next spring.Proceeds from the sale of DVDs showcasing the research will go to the restoration of a memorial dedicated to thousands of men of the 38th (Welsh) Division who died on the Somme in 1916.The red dragon sculpture stands near a village in Picardy at an area known for the Battle of Mametz Wood which claimed many lives.History teacher Owen Thomas said: "As a school we felt it was important that pupils of all ages were involved in marking the centenary and learning about the conflict and having been part of the project from the very beginning when we were applying for funding, they can't wait to get going with their research."</body>

      <body>The mother of a murdered backpacker has urged the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to do more to help families whose relatives are killed abroad.Kirsty Jones, 23, from Tredomen, near Brecon, Powys was raped and strangled in Thailand in 2000.Sue Jones is annoyed she has had no response to a Freedom of Information request to have murder investigation files released.The FCO said it would meet any family concerned about a death overseas.Mrs Jones supported a protest by about 20 families, in a similar situation to her, outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London on Wednesday.She said she had been trying to persuade the Foreign Office to release documents relating to her daughter's murder for six months, but UK government officials had claimed the information could harm diplomatic relations or prejudice a future court case."As far as I'm concerned communication is their (the Foreign Office's) biggest problem," said Mrs Jones."They can only do as much as they're allowed to do but claiming that these documents could damage diplomatic relations is ridiculous."All we want to know is what happened and we want justice."Mrs Jones was unable to attend the protest in person.But she said: "I supported what the other families were doing in London yesterday. Some of those families don't even know the circumstances of their relatives' deaths."She added: "I don't know if the documents I've asked to be released are crucial or if they hold something that we already know about.'Incredibly difficult time'"I think sometimes the Foreign Office and the (UK) government could push a little bit more with their counterparts abroad. They must understand that all we want is closure."Kirsty Jones, a Liverpool University graduate, was killed in Chiang Ma in northern Thailand just three months into a two-year trip around the world in August, 2000.Since then, Mrs Jones has worked tirelessly to try to bring her daughter's murderer is brought to justice, even travelling to Thailand with Welsh police last year to publicise a £10,000 reward for information.But, despite numerous appeals, her daughter's killer has never been found.In response, the FCO said in a statement: "The FCO will meet with any family who is concerned about the death of a loved one overseas."This is an incredibly difficult time for any family and the FCO has teams of trained professionals in the UK and across the world ready to offer support."Every year, over 6,000 British nationals die overseas, and the FCO offers to provide consular support to every single family in conjunction with a range of partners including the police and coroner services.It added: "However, investigation of the death of any British national is a matter for the judicial process of the country they died in, and we must respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK's laws and legal processes."</body>

      <title>20-year lake legal row continues</title>
      <description>A farmer loses the latest twist in a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake on his land in west Wales.</description>

      <body>A farmer has lost the latest twist in a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake.John Rogers built Bwlchyllan lake and embankment near Lampeter in 1991 without permission and Ceredigion council wanted the land restored due to safety fears.Mr Rogers has been fined twice by magistrates for ignoring an enforcement notice.Councillors refused to accept the lake had become part of the landscape.Following the vote councillors asked officers to put enforcement action in place to require Mr Rogers to remove an embankment which would in effect get rid of the lake.The lake is on sloping land and is about 180m (590ft) long and 80m (262 ft) at its widest point with a depth of 3.7m (12 ft).A retrospective planning application was refused in January this year because it again failed to demonstrate that the lake was safe.But it has since been deemed "as safe as can reasonably be expected," allowing planners to recommend approval of the plans.Despite the long legal history, councillors were asked to deal with this fresh application on its own merits.A planning report said the lake has now become part of the natural environment and landscape."Whether rightly or wrongly the lake has now been in existence since 1991, a period of over 20 years," says the report."As a result the site has been given the opportunity to develop naturally so it is surrounded by natural vegetation with reeds along the lake shore and on a small island in the centre of the lake."The embankment is now completely covered with mature vegetation which broadens densely on the lower reaches of the embankment."Meanwhile, structural engineers say because the lake and embankment have managed to survive significant flooding over the last 20 years, they should be considered stable.Councillors have also been told that there may be water voles at the lake and Natural Resources Wales wants an investigation to see if they do live there.But opponents are worried that the embankment is not safe and could give way at some point.Geoffrey Stubberfield, who lives near by, said: "We have concerns that the bank could be well unstable."Nobody saw how it was built. It's terribly dangerous. If there's a catastrophic collapse, it could mean lives."And Michael Jones, who also lives close to the lake, added: "There's evidence of weeping from it but it hasn't collapsed."</body>

      <body>Hundreds of jobs will be cut at Carmarthenshire council as a result of the Welsh government's draft budget, its leader has said.At a council meeting on Thursday, Kevin Madge announced "many hundreds" of jobs would go as the authority would have to make savings of £30m.Offers of redundancy or early retirement have been made to staff.The Welsh government said it had cushioned the impact of UK government cuts in the past three years.But this week, Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced funding for local government would be cut by almost 6% next year.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Ms Hutt stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.Mr Madge warned on Thursday of extremely tough times ahead.In a statement, he said: "This is an unprecedented situation, and it means we are faced with making some very difficult and unpopular decisions."People will have to brace themselves - but I want to assure everyone that we will do our very best to protect frontline services, and continue to provide as many services as we can whilst avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible."He also appealed for "some understanding" from ministers on the "extraordinarily difficult times ahead" for councils.The Welsh government said in a statement that over the past three years it had been able to cushion local authorities from "the impact of relentless cuts to our budget from the UK government"."We have shaped our budget to focus on our core values of social justice and protecting the most vulnerable. We have made some tough decisions between areas as well as within programmes," said a spokesperson."We are looking at ways to work alongside and support authorities to manage the reductions to their funding, and the minister for local government and government business will announce full details of the local government settlement next week."The only way to confront these financial challenges and sustain local public services is to do different things. Councils need to strive for transformational change to manage the difficult times ahead."</body>

      <body>A controversial decision to turn the AandE service at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli into a nurse-led unit supported by GPs has been heavily criticised.Carmarthenshire councillors tabled a motion saying they "deplored" Health Minister Mark Drakeford's decision.It would increase pressure on Glangwili and Morriston hospitals, they said.The Welsh government said the minister had backed the decision of an independent panel of experts.Council leader Kevin Madge said: "I believe that the only way forward is to get the health minister down, and we will then negotiate and carry on the fight."We will continue making representations to the ministers. At the end of the day we have got to ensure that our services are safe."Campaigners in Llanelli have been given leave for a judicial review of the AandE changes at the hospital, but Mr Drakeford told AMs last month he would approve the plans.The judicial review is due to take place in November.The shake-up is one of several disputed changes to hospital services in west Wales proposed by Hywel Dda Health Board and referred to the minister.They include:In February the Community Health Council (CHC) said it could not support most of the proposals and referred them to the then Health Minister Lesley Griffiths for a decision.Ms Griffiths told the CHC in March that its referral did not satisfy Welsh government rules as it had not proposed alternatives.A month later, the CHC said it could not accept the health board's neonatal and AandE changes and referred those proposals for a second time to the Welsh government.Meanwhile, the CHC was able to "conditionally accept" the closure of the two minor injuries units and the closure of Mynydd Mawr hospital which are now being implemented.In response, the new health minister Mark Drakeford set up a scrutiny panel led by chief medical officer Dr Ruth Hussey to "consider these issues" and "examine all relevant documentation".The notice by Carmarthenshire councillors reads: "Carmarthenshire County Council deplores the decision to replace the level two AandE at Prince Philip Hospital with a nurse practitioner-led and GP-supported provision."We will continue to lobby the minister and the health board to review this decision to reduce resources and services at the hospital, and call for the level two AandE services to be preserved in its current configuration and where appropriate, enhanced."We would further request from the health minister a statement detailing the services available at our hospitals."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "The Health Minister, Mark Drakeford, backed the recommendations of an independent group of clinical experts to implement the changes to improve services at Prince Philip Hospital."The decision of the panel was influenced by their views on the best way to maintain high quality care for local residents."It would be plainly wrong for the health minister to question the judgement and recommendations of a group of such esteemed health professionals."The spokesperson added that the AandE saw 33,000 patients in 2011/12 of which 6,500 were major cases and 422 of those needed a transfer to another hospital.</body>

      <title>Council objects to mine extension</title>

      <body>A council has asked for proposals to extend the life of an opencast mine in a neighbouring county to be called in by ministers for review.Celtic Energy has bid to continue to operate East Pit in the Amman Valley.The site is in Neath Port Talbot but a report before Carmarthenshire councillors said people there will be affected by noise and pollution.Neath Port Talbot council said it was monitoring the operations at the site and all complaints were investigated.Coal reserves are due to be exhausted at the mine in around five years but the planning extension is required for the last three.Celtic Energy has submitted the application to Neath Port Talbot (NPT) council.The site is near Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen in Neath Port Talbot but is on the border with Carmarthenshire.Once work is finished at the opencast mine, developers hope to go ahead with £35m proposals for a country park, hotel, holiday lodges and diving school on the site.Those plans are also before NPT, which makes the final decision, but Carmarthenshire council has to be consulted on both applications.At a meeting on Thursday, Carmarthenshire planners backed a highly critical report which said the "further extension of the site will significantly extend the period of disturbance" for nearby residents.They decided to ask the Welsh government to call in the planning application.In response, NPT said it was considering both the coal mining extension request and the development proposals and confirmed that Celtic Energy was continuing to operate at the site without planning permission.It said: "The council has agreed not to take enforcement action pending the determination of these applications, nevertheless we are monitoring the operations being undertaken at the site."All complaints received are investigated including those relating to blasting, which are all in compliance with the guidance issued by the Welsh government in addition to the original planning conditions."In January, Neath AM Gwenda Thomas said ministers should call in the development plan due to concerns over its impact and proximity to the Brecon Beacons National Park.</body>

      <body>Candidates have been put off applying for the vacant police chief constable job at Gwent Police because of the actions of its police and crime commissioner, a senior MP has claimed.Carmel Napier quit in June after an order from commissioner (PCC) Ian Johnston to "retire or be removed".Her deputy Jeff Farrar was the only applicant to replace her and is the "proposed candidate" for the top job.Caerphilly MP Wayne David said having just one applicant was "disappointing".The Gwent Police and Crime Panel will have to confirm the appointment which comes with a £133,068 a year salary.But Mr David, the parliamentary private secretary to Labour leader Ed Miliband, said he was not surprised more people did not go for the job.He told Radio Wales: "I was very disappointed because I was very much hoping there would be a wide field and the choice would be made from that wide field."Although an excellent chief constable has been selected in Jeff Farrar, who I know and hold in very high regard, it's nevertheless disappointing there wasn't a bigger field."I think you have to look at what's happened over the last few months in Gwent."Mr David said the way in which Mrs Napier was dealt with indicated that the commissioner had expected her to "basically kowtow" to him.He added: "I would imagine that many aspiring senior police officers in the county have seen what happened in Gwent and thought 'right, we're not going to be in that situation'."I think what's happened in Gwent - and inevitably the buck stops with him as the PCC - is one of the main reasons, probably the primary reason why there were not more applications."Mr Farrar, who has served as a police officer for 29 years, joined Gwent Police from neighbouring South Wales Police in 2009 having been appointed as assistant chief constable.He was then promoted to deputy chief constable in April 2011. He has been temporary chief constable since Mrs Napier's departure.Following an interview on Monday, Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Mr Johnston named Mr Farrar as his "proposed candidate", saying he was the "kind of leader Gwent Police needs at this time"."During the time I have worked with Jeff Farrar he has proved himself to be a highly competent and effective officer," he added.The decision will now be referred to the Gwent Police and Crime Panel - which oversees and scrutinises the PCC - on 8 November for it to confirm the appointment.Mr Johnston declined to comment on Mr David's remarks until after the confirmation hearing.A police watchdog said the forced departure Mrs Napier brought instability to Gwent Police at a critical time.HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said in July that the force faced a difficult challenge as the force has to save £23.5m by 2015.In July, Mrs Napier told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that she was forced to resign following "menacing and bullying" treatment by the force's police commissioner.Mr Johnston denied the allegations and that the resignation had caused instability.</body>

      <body>Eighty four defendants have appeared in court after being charged under a so-called "crash for cash" fraud investigation in south Wales.A special all-day sitting took place at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in Torfaen before a district judge on Thursday.The oldest defendant was a 71-year-old woman from Cardiff and the youngest was a 23-year-old woman from Blackwood.Charges include fraud against insurance firms, conspiracy to steal vehicles and money laundering.In total, 86 people face charges, with the remaining two due to appear in court next week.The case comes after a two-year investigation by Gwent Police into a "crash for cash" scheme where accidents are staged to defraud insurance companies.More than 40 people appeared before magistrates on Thursday morning, speaking only to confirm their names and addresses, with the rest appearing in the afternoon.In the morning session, all but one of the defendants was bailed to appear at Newport Crown Court on various dates in early November.

      <description>Cardiff City call a board meeting for Monday following their decision to place head of recruitment Iain Moody on gardening leave.</description>

      <body>Cardiff City have called a board meeting for Monday following their decision to place head of recruitment Iain Moody on gardening leave.The club have denied reports they asked manager Malky Mackay to resign after his right-hand man was suspended, with 23-year-old Alisher Apsalyamov brought in as his acting replacement.It is understood Mackay, 41, has given up hope of keeping Moody at the club but won't leave himself.Cardiff are yet to comment.In his scouting role, former Watford press officer Moody helped the club sign summer recruits including Gary Medel from Sevilla and Steven Caulker from Tottenham.Apsalyamov is not believed to have any experience in football and his appointment is the latest controversy in the reign of owner Vincent Tan.The Malaysian caused consternation among many Cardiff fans during the summer of 2012 after changing the club's colours from blue to red, while there have been reports of dressing-room unrest over bonuses.Cardiff City Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Hartley said recent developments were of concern."Fans want Malky Mackay - who has done a fantastic job as manager, taking the club to the Premier League - to remain at Cardiff City," Hartley said."We don't want to see any action taken to undermine his position as manager and Cardiff City's efforts to have a successful first season in the top division."There are fears that the current developments could drive Malky into the arms of another Premier League club and that would be hugely damaging."Fans deserve a clear statement on the position from the club on what has been happening and Malky's position needs to be made perfectly clear."Former England boss Graham Taylor, meanwhile, is bemused by recent developments."It is a very, very strange situation," said Taylor, who was Watford chairman and worked with Mackay and Moody at Vicarage Road."I cannot believe... the decision to replace Iain. I just cannot believe it."It will be interesting to see what Malky's reaction is. I do hope this doesn't have an adverse reaction on the team's performance and results."He is the manager and he has just got the club into the Premier League after such a long time out of it."I don't think you will see any public tantrums from Malky or anything like that [but] I know he will be extremely upset and disappointed."</body>

      <title>Plaid's pledge to cut energy bills</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, addressing the party conference, announces plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.</description>

      <date>1381503345</date>
      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has announced plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.Energy Wales would buy gas and electricity at wholesale prices and sell direct to consumers and firms, she told the Aberystwyth conference.Surpluses would be spit between protecting customers and expanding energy efficiency measures.Ms Wood said the firm would work as an arms-length company like Welsh Water."When Labour's energy price freeze begins to thaw and prices begin to spike again, Plaid Cymru would have enabled the building of our cheaper, permanent, people-powered Welsh alternative," she said.In her second annual conference speech since being elected party leader, she said Plaid would recruit 1,000 extra doctors if it won the assembly election in 2016.This would be financed by a sugary drink levy of up to 20p per litre, she said.She also announced radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales over the next assembly term.Ms Wood also announced an "alternative way forward" on hospital reorganisation plans.Labour has accused her of blocking a controversial shake-up of some specialist services without suggesting alternatives.Welsh Labour ministers have insisted closing some hospitals and moving some core services from smaller to larger hospitals are essential to make the NHS safe and sustainable.Some of the most controversial have been in south Wales, with opposition to proposals to move key specialist care from Llantrisant's Royal Glamorgan hospital as part of changes at five health boards.Ms Wood said Plaid was committed to delivering a better Welsh NHS with 1,000 extra doctors."We will provide more doctors so these services can stay open and stay safe," she said."If a thousand extra doctors sounds over-ambitious consider this."With them, Wales would only be brought up to the UK average - so we must have those extra doctors."She told party members this would help provide a more efficient NHS, as would plans to better integrate hospitals and social care "to get patients out of hospital and back into their own home".The Plaid leader said funding to begin this integration had already been won as part of a package of measures the party had this week announced with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers in a deal on the Welsh budget.Ms Wood said there was a "crisis of obesity and diabetes that was killing us as a nation."She also unveiled radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales, over the next assembly term.Plaid has said previously Wales can learn from how Norway, Germany and Denmark have offered modern hospital care without centralisation.The party has argued planning the NHS workforce more effectively and better recruitment practices would help reduce some of the strains on the health service.Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru was the only party addressing people's big concerns at the 2016 assembly election and that "Wales is better than this".Ms Wood started her speech by saying Plaid would build on recent momentum.She said this would "carry us forward over the finishing line" to win the assembly election in 2016."It isn't a sprint but a marathon and I'm firing the starting pistol here today."She said she was committed to Plaid being the next government of Wales "so we can build Wales up, turn around the economic situation, stand on our own two feet."Plaid Cymru also points to the budget deal it signed with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers earlier in the week which put more money into treating patients in the community as a way of both improving services and keeping more patients out of hospital.All party members who attend the two-day conference will be able to vote on the motions debated. Until now that was reserved for delegates representing various sections of the party.The change is part of internal reforms brought in following Plaid Cymru's disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election.Ms Wood promoted plans to cut business rates for smaller firms on the opening day of the two-day Aberystwyth event.Firms would qualify for reduced business rates if their rateable values was below £15,000, rather than £12,000 under the current regime.A rateable value below £10,000 would mean paying no business rates, rather than the £6,000 ceiling at present.Ms Wood has also defended her party's election performances since devolution.With the SNP in government in Scotland, she was asked on BBC Radio Wales why the Scottish nationalists had moved so much further on than Plaid."I think it reflects the different settlement that Wales has had compared to Scotland," said Ms Wood."Scotland is so much further ahead in terms of the devolution settlement and Wales is in a different place."Our settlement is much weaker as is our economic situation and that's why I've said since I've become the leader of Plaid Cymru that the economy and job creation should be our number one priority."I would argue that Scotland has got a government that puts Scotland first and Scottish communities first at every opportunity and Wales needs a government now that will do that and I would argue that a Plaid Cymru government after 2016 is what the country needs now."SNP MP Pete Wishart urged Plaid activists to join in with the campaign.To enthusiastic applause, he told the conference: "We will win, because independence is the aspiration...that puts the future of Scotland in the hands of the people who live and work in Scotland."</body>

      <title>Obesity challenge 'urgent' warning</title>
      <description>Obesity is on the increase and remains one of the biggest challenges facing the health service, Wales' chief medical officer warns.</description>

      <date>1381335327</date>
      <body>Obesity is on the increase and remains one of the biggest challenges facing the population, Wales' chief medical officer has warned.It comes in her annual report on the nation's state of health.The report said people in Wales were living longer but ageing with chronic illnesses, many of them avoidable.Dr Ruth Hussey also said that the economic downturn may be taking its toll on the health of the population with "no quick fixes"."Obesity continues to increase with an associated rise in diabetes," she said in the report."There are more adults being treated for high blood pressure, and poor mental health remains a problem."Too few people do enough physical activity."In her report, she described an explosion in childhood obesity as "one of the most serious health challenges of the early 21st Century".She said the issue of overweight children had trebled in the last three decades, and could lead to "serious health consequences, significant reductions in quality of life and a greater risk of bullying and social isolation".According to a programme brought in during 2011 to measure the height and weight of every school pupil at age five in Wales, 28% were overweight or obese.Evidence presented in the report also suggested that there had been very little change in the rates of physical activity for any adult age group.In addition, with the exception of the over-65s, fewer adults were eating five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day compared with 2008.In her conclusion, the chief medical officer stressed: "Action on obesity is urgent and there is growing evidence that physical activity benefits both our mental and physical health."Everyone needs to be more active."According to official figures, life expectancy in Wales in 2009-2011 had risen to 78 years for men and 82.2 years for women.The age you can expect to lead a full healthy life has also risen to 63 years. However, that also means that as women live longer, they can expect their general health to be poorer for longer as they get older.But the report also warned that many chronic illnesses could be avoided by reducing smoking and drinking, alongside improvements to nutrition and increased physical activity.The report also addressed the issue of the delicate balance between the economy of Wales and the health of its population."There are three major economic issues facing Wales with the potential to impact adversely on health, namely long-term structural poverty and deprivation, the impact of the economic downturn and the impact of benefit reform," said Dr Hussey."Poverty is currently harming health and the impact may worsen, at least temporarily, with the continued economic downturn and benefit reform."Poor health in turn places a significant burden on the economy."The challenge is whether Wales can create a beneficial cycle where better health supports a prospering economy that in turn generates good health."Responding to the publication of the report on Wednesday, the Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I welcome this report from the chief medical officer (CMO) in her first year in the role."As the CMO states we must be relentless in our aim of preventing poor health in Wales and this can be done through reducing unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking and obesity."Although life expectancy continues to improve, people are ageing with chronic illnesses which are often preventable and ageing well must be a key focus for us."The report from the chief medical officer comes as BBC Cymru Wales launches its own season of programmes aimed at inspiring people to make their lifestyles healthier.A poll of 502 people for the Live Longer Wales season found that 82% of people agreed that overweight people should have to lose weight before undergoing non-urgent surgery.Two-thirds of those questioned also backed the statement that the NHS spent too much on treating preventable illness that stemmed from poor diet and a lack of exercise.</body>

      <title>Sky lantern and balloon ban urged</title>

      <body>Councils should introduce a voluntary ban on the release of sky lanterns and helium balloons on their land, says the Welsh government.It comes three months after ministers rejected banning them after a report said it could not be justified, but use would be discouraged.Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies has written to councils encouraging them to introduce the restrictions.There are worries the lanterns pose a fire risk and endanger livestock.Two environmental groups and the Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) have called for an outright ban.Conwy council has already stopped people releasing sky lanterns and helium balloons on its land.Mr Davies warned of the danger and stress that sky lanterns could pose to animals and highlighted the fire risks."Sky lanterns and helium balloons pose a real danger to livestock, other animals and buildings," Mr Davies said."A recent independent report has found that the fire risk associated with the use of sky lanterns is significant, while we also know that the ingestion of debris from lanterns can kill or seriously harm an animal."We want to make people aware of the risks and that is why I have written to local authorities across Wales to encourage them to introduce a voluntary ban on the release of sky lanterns and helium balloons."We are also supporting the UK government's efforts to work with retailers and manufacturers to ensure that clear warnings about the risk of helium balloons and sky lanterns are placed on packaging."Farming unions have previously highlighted the risk the lanterns pose to animals and farm buildings, while fire service bosses have also warned of the dangers.FUW parliamentary committee chairman Gavin Williams welcomed Mr Davies's intervention, saying the UK government had "failed to act" on the issue.He said: "The risk of livestock ingesting parts of sky lanterns and the fire risk they represent are a huge concern, and we have asked members to continue to report incidents to their county branches so that evidence of their effects can continue to be collected."The Marine Conservation Society and Keep Wales Tidy have called for an outright ban.</body>

      <description>Wales boss Chris Coleman says he learned of Craig Bellamy's international retirement by reading a newspaper.</description>

      <body>Wales manager Chris Coleman says he first discovered Craig Bellamy's decision to retire from international football by reading a newspaper.Cardiff City forward Bellamy will end his Wales career after the World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia on Friday and Belgium next Tuesday.Although he was not informed directly, Coleman says it comes as no surprise."The first time I saw that - I had a feeling anyway - I read it in a newspaper," Coleman said."The whole campaign, we never had him at the start, there was other things going on."Then he was back in and he's hinted that this would be his last campaign, so I can't say it was a big surprise."In the back of my mind I was planning forward, if I'm going to be here, without Craig anyway."I think Craig has come out in numerous articles expressing what he thinks, so it was no big surprise when I read it."Coleman paid tribute to the 34-year-old Bellamy, who has won 76 caps for Wales and scored 19 goals during a 15-year international career."He's approaching 80 caps and that's no mean feat," Coleman added."It's fitting that the last game [at home] is at Cardiff City [Stadium], I think he's made the right decision to stop now."He's put the shift in, he'll get the credit he deserves from the... supporters and that's what he deserves."When you're a player you don't look at choosing this game or that game when you bow out, you just know when enough is enough."It's not numbers with a player - you don't think "I've got 60 caps, can I get 65?" - you keep coming and you keep coming until you can't perform like you want to anymore."In the pre-match press conference before facing Macedonia, Coleman also spoke about the clear-the-air talks he had with James Collins.Coleman had accused the West Ham defender of rejecting the chance to join the Wales squad before their World Cup qualifier with Serbia in September.Collins had denied that claim, but met Coleman on Wednesday and is now in training with a Wales squad shorn of 11 players through injury.Coleman said: "James called me when he finished training with West Ham, had a chat on the phone, but the chat we needed to have was across the table."He travelled down here, fair play to him, he told me where he was coming from and I told him where I was coming from and I have been public in what I have said."He thought he was being singled out, which he wasn't."I explained my reasons and he accepted that. He is here for a huge game, he is here and that is all we can ask."It doesn't mean we agree on everything, but the important thing is to move forward, and we can, which is the important thing."He has his desire to play for Wales, if he didn't want to play he would not have travelled to talk to me and thrash it out."When we talked we weren't having a cuddle or a laugh and a joke, but he was here and we told each other what was on our minds."</body>

      <title>Evans warns Wales over Heineken row</title>
      <description>Former Harlequins chief Mark Evans says Wales rugby must learn from past mistakes if it is to survive the Heineken Cup row.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/24485843</url>
      <date>1381488461</date>
      <body>Ex-Harlequins chief Mark Evans says Welsh rugby could have averted problems caused by the current Heineken Cup row by joining a British League.After rugby union went professional in 1995, a competition involving English, Welsh and Scottish teams was proposed.But legal problems and in-fighting saw British League plans shelved."That opportunity was spurned for a number of reasons back in the mid to late 90s and I think we're back there," Evans told Radio Wales Sport.Evans, originally from Cardiff, was chief executive at Harlequins until 2011 and now fills that role with Melbourne Storm in Australia.English and French clubs will quit the Heineken Cup next year and have proposed the rival Rugby Champions Cup.The Welsh, Scottish and Irish rugby unions have all said they will block their teams playing in any cross-border tournament that is not sanctioned by the International Rugby Board.The uncertainty over what competitions they will be in next season is already causing problems for the four Welsh regional teams.The leading example is Wales and British and Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton, who is one of several senior Welsh players out of contract with their Welsh regions at the end of this season.The flanker says he wants to stay with Cardiff Blues, but adds the region has been unable to offer him a contract extension beyond this season as they cannot plan a budget because of uncertainty over Europe.And top agent Tim Lopez, who represents the Blues' Leigh Halfpenny amongst others, says players are waiting to see what happens before making decisions.Meanwhile Evans says the situation has echoes from the 1998-99 season, which saw Cardiff and Swansea rebel against the Welsh Rugby Union - resigning from the Welsh League and playing friendlies against English clubs instead that year.The two clubs had refused to sign a 10-year participation agreement with the WRU and were unhappy that Welsh rugby's governing body and its English counterpart - the Rugby Football Union - had ruled out a British League.Peace was restored the following season, with Cardiff and Swansea returning to the Welsh fold.Wales now has four regional sides - the Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons - as its top professional tier, which play in the Pro12 with Irish, Scottish and Italian teams.Evans warned Welsh rugby again faced a crucial crossroads."It's a strategic decision for the Welsh Rugby Union... you could go back a long way, 15 years or so, and say strategically Wales got it wrong," Evans said."Do you want to align yourself with a market of 50m [people] or do you want to align yourself with a market of 10m?"Anyone working in sports marketing anywhere in the world trying to build their sport will say: 'I'll align with the 50m.' That would be a lot more sensible.Evans added: "If I'm honest the errors of the 1990s are now coming home to roost in a major, major way and I think it's quite hard to see how Wales will prosper."Evans does not believe any of the Welsh teams will rebel and try to break away from the WRU."Wales is not a big enough economy to have a split between its national team and however many other - it doesn't matter whether you call them clubs or regions," Evans said."Where do Wales' best interests lie in the long run? As opposed to traditional and historic [links]?"But Evans feels the governing body must do all it can to build secure financial future for the game in Wales, even if that means acceding to the demands of the English and French clubs."I think you'd struggle to make the case that there is some kind of historic, traditional link between Wales and the other Celtic unions as opposed to Wales and England or Wales and France.""I've been away a long time but we've got 2m people in south Wales, it's a relatively poor area of Britain."Why is it revolutionary to align yourself to get the best commercial returns for the country that you represent?"</body>

      <body>Scarlets will be without Wales hooker Ken Owens and joint skipper Rob McCusker for their Heineken Cup opener at Harlequins on Saturday.Emyr Phillips deputises for Owens while Josh Turnbull steps in for McCusker in the back-row.British and Irish Lions centre Jonathan Davies leads the Scarlets in his joint-skipper role.Quins and Scarlets have met once at The Stoop in Europe with the Welsh side losing 29-24 during 2008-09.The son of former Llanelli club side fly-half Frano Botica, Ben, lines up at centre for the London club.Conor O'Shea's Quins go into the tournament with three defeats and two wins from five Aviva Premiership starts.Scarlets' record in the Pro12 is also three defeats and two wins, but Scarlets head coach Simon Easterby says his side must "hit a new level" if they are to enjoy a win to match the bonus-point triumph at Northampton in November 2011 and their 2009 win at London Irish.Easterby said: "You can draw on your experiences from those big games - they're pretty special and as players you can take inspiration from those wins, knowing you've done it before; but we have to be very focused on this game, our levels of consistency and our own performance.""Our scrum has been effective this season. It's something we have put a big focus on for the last 18 months and is certainly adding more to our game with Danny Wilson's input."But it's a constant work on and we have plenty more to do."And when we get some good quality ball delivered to our back line we know how dangerous those players can be. So it should be a great contest on Saturday."There's nothing like Heineken Cup weeks to get everyone motivated and especially an Anglo-Welsh contest and we're confident that if we get our house in order, we can cause other teams problems."We've seen it in patches in our first five weeks of the season and we can take a lot from those games."However, we know we'll have to hit a new level this weekend and set our stall out in this opening European fixture."We've only been a few per cent off clicking but there's no room for error in these contests."Harlequins: Mike Brown; Tom Williams, Matt Hopper, Ben Botica, Sam Smith; Nick Evans, Danny Care; Joe Marler, Rob Buchanan, Will Collier, George Merrick, George Robson, Maurie Fa'asavalu, Nick Easter, Chris Robshaw (capt),Replacements: Dave Ward, Darryl Marfo, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Guest, Luke Wallace, Karl Dickson, Paul Sackey, Charlie Walker.Scarlets: Liam Williams; Kristian Phillips, Jonathan Davies (capt), Scott Williams, Jordan Williams; Rhys Priestland, Rhodri Williams; Phil John, Emyr Phillips, Samson Lee, Jake Ball, George Earle, Aaron Shingler, John Barclay, Josh Turnbull, John Barclay.Replacements: Kirby Myhill, Rob Evans, Jacobie Adriaanse, Johan Snyman, Craig Price, Gareth Davies, Steven Shingler, Gareth Maule.Referee: John Lacey (Ireland).Assistant refs: Peter Fitzgibbon (Ireland), Olly Hodges (Ireland).TMO: Marshall Kilgore (Ireland).Citing commissioner: Jean-Claude Legendre (France).</body>

Dywedodd y tri gwasanaeth yng Nghymru eu bod wedi ymdopi bryd hynny, ac roedd y tri wedi gwneud trefniadau wrth gefn.Dywedodd y cadeirydd Cerith Griffiths wrth Newyddion Ar-lein: "Rwy'n ffyddiog y bydd yr ymateb y tro hwn cyn gryfed ag yn y streic ddiwethaf."Mae'n ymddangos y bydd y broses yma'n mynd ymlaen am sbel, ac ry'n ni'n barod i gadw i frwydro."Cafodd y streic gyntaf ym mis Medi ei chynnal rhwng hanner dydd a 4:00pm ar ddydd Mercher, ond bydd y streic nesa'n digwydd mewn cyfnod llawer prysurach i'r Gwasanaethau Tân ac Achub, sef ar nos Sadwrn.Roedd Mr Griffiths yn cyfaddef fod hynny'n ddwysâd yn yr ymgyrch, gan ychwanegu:"Ydi mae e'n escalation.

      <title>Presenter's fat at 40-plus challenge</title>
      <description>Newsreader on his own get-fit challenge</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24480906</url>

      <body>News presenter Jamie Owen has been a familiar face to BBC Wales viewers for more than 20 years. Here he explains his quest to lead a healthier lifestyle and drop a few pounds.I've lost count of the number of times that I've read out news stories on television about Britain's growing obesity time bomb, our diabetes crisis, Wales' habit of eating too much, drinking too much and not taking enough exercise.Each time, shifting rather heavily in the news anchor's chair - I knew that this story was as much about me as anyone else - Jamie Owen: 45 years old, fifteen and a half stone, overweight and needing to do something about it.Throughout much of my childhood, like most kids I was a faddy eater and wouldn't touch vegetables and it was my thin-ness that might have concerned my parents. My brothers and I led an outdoors life - we played football in the street, climbed trees and walked to school.Photographs from my student days tell a story of a lean teenager staring back at the camera. I joined the BBC in London at the age of 21 and spent my first years of my working life cycling to and from work.But I was a fast food addict.I loved junk - fish and chips, kebabs, Chinese takeaways and curries were not weekend treats, they were my staple diet, washed down with a few beers.None of it seemed to matter of course, because I was burning off the fat.I was walking everywhere or biking to and from work and I didn't have the money to have a car, so exercise was part of my everyday life - not a lifestyle decision.When I moved back to Wales, the bike came too but my new job paid me just enough money to qualify for a bank loan, which allowed me to buy something I'd lusted after for years - a second hand car.I took every opportunity to jump behind the wheel and play with my new toy. The bike gathered dust.My wheels changed, but not my food or drink.My perfect day would start with a cooked breakfast followed by a good lunch with a dinner of fish and chips, Chinese or Indian.After a childhood of wholesome home cooked fresh food I wanted the exotic delights from foreign countries best enjoyed out of a take away carton. Oh and fish and chips. I knew it was bad for me but I still ate it.And then there was the drink.My particular poison was cola - the full fat stuff. I would get through perhaps three cans some days, on shift work.I found it particularly useful to keep me awake. I loved fruit smoothies too - who could possibly suggest that a glass or two of that fruit goodness could be harmful? I should have just opened my mouth and eaten a bag of sugar.The truth is of course that Britain is downing sugar-filled drinks from the earliest of ages.You are what you eat - but what you drink also has a profound effect on your weight and your health too.All of which brings me onto booze. I have been always fond of a beer or two and sometimes three. What I never did was drink alcohol in the house. If I wanted to have few beers it would be a night out down the pub perhaps twice a week.What changed for me, and I suspect for many people over the last 20 years or so, was the rise of drinking at home.I'd have a glass of wine with dinner perhaps two and on the weekends maybe three.Hardly the stuff of Oliver Reed, but across the week it's a fair bit of alcohol. While confusion reigns over unit sizes we're allowed to have, what is beyond debate is that more of us are drinking at home than ever before and drinking too much.At the age of 45, I looked in the mirror one morning and thought, who's that fat bloke staring at me? I had reached a time in my life when I had to face either continuing as I had been and accepting the health consequences, or do something about it.Most of us don't venture into a doctor's surgery unless we're ill, me included. I had never felt better. I'm never ill. I have never taken a day off work for sickness. I don't smoke. Ok I was a little on the porky side, but surely I had nothing to fear from a once-over in a surgery?Dr Marina Arulanandum, my GP is old school, she makes time to talk, but no bedside manner could diplomatically hide the readings; my blood pressure was high and I was packed off next for an MRI scan with Dr Simon Blease.He has an MRI scanner specially made for the larger patient. For half an hour I lay still while magnets made a sonar-like image of the inside of my body.If my GP's pep talk had been uncomfortable then this was a hundred times worse. Dr Simon had the black and white images of my innards on his computerMy biology lessons got me through where to look for lungs, heart and liver, but beyond that I was struggling with the unfamiliarity of what I was seeing. It wasn't too difficult as it turned out - you guessed it - a white layer of fat. This wasn't my fat belly but hidden fat within my body.Dr Simon was once a little on the large side but saw the light a few years ago and made changes to his lifestyle.His bête noir as a doctor is our addiction to sugar. He thinks we've got health campaigns all wrong. Rather than making fat in food, the bogey man - Britain should instead be worried about our sugar consumption.He says, the white stuff is killing us and we're all hooked.My MRI scan tells of a pretty average 40-something Welshman who is overweight. But the abiding image is that my lungs are slightly restricted in their movement because of the fat in my body.It's obvious isn't it - if you have fat in your body - it's displacing other things that should be in its place.A picture paints a thousand words. If I had any doubt about sticking to the plan it is quickly displaced.Losing weight is combated by three factors - increasing exercise, improving diet and reducing alcohol.I didn't have a Damascene conversion and suddenly decide to embrace any of these - but instead it was a grudging acceptance that either I had to change or get fatter.I resolved not to make my new health regime a short-term endurance that I would be sure to give up on within weeks, so I resisted the temptation to give up alcohol completely.But what has changed is the quantity and frequency. Where I would have once have had two bottles of beer in an evening I now have one, where I would have once have had two glasses of wine I have just one. And I try to have five nights of no alcohol at all as opposed to my previous regime of just two.Added to that all soft drinks have been binned - and it's pints of water three times a day.My previous food regime of a steady intake of crisps, pork pies, takeaways and pasta dishes has been given the bullet.In its place, breakfasts of granola, and a new departure at lunchtime - eating lunch. I would often skip lunch thinking that not consuming food would help the cause - but abstinence is bunkum of course, at least for me, and I would be starving by mid-afternoon and start troughing on snacks to sate my appetite.My new lunch includes freshly cooked dishes like asparagus with poached eggs washed down with a pint of water.Dinner is now freshly cooked fish or chicken with vegetables. And there's no wine, unless it's the weekend. Smart planning is essential to avoid finding the cupboard bare and then reaching for the takeaway menu.Food and drink is only part of this story of course. I have signed up a personal trainer for two hours a week. I hate gyms. Catrin, my personal trainer, makes me box until exhausted.She forces me to do press ups until I begin to think I'll need a defibrillator and her weights exercises make me feel as physically inadequate as I did in school.But the point is she is the reason why I turn up at all. Without that appointment in the diary I would find an excuse not to bother.We all deceive ourselves about our health.We like to think it's someone else's responsibility - so we blame schools, parents, supermarkets but ultimately, our health is our responsibility.At time of writing I have lost a stone and I now weigh 14 stone - down from 15.6. I cycle to work three times a week (if it's not raining) and I use it for all of those errands where once I would have jumped in the car.I've tried to stick with the plan - I'm still going to the gym twice a week, still off the junk food and the booze (bar the odd snifter at weekends).My clothes are hanging off me and I get phone calls from my favourite pubs and restaurants wondering if I'm well. The truth is I've never felt better.Jamie Owen - Fat and Fortysomething is broadcast on BBC One Wales, Friday 11 October at 20:30 BST.</body>

      <title>Film effects used to fight arthritis</title>
      <description>Arthritis researchers use CGI to understand the condition</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24467185</url>

      <body>Technology usually associated with Hollywood blockbusters is being used to help tackle arthritis.A virtual reality centre - believed to be the first of its kind in the UK - has been set up at Cardiff University with equipment used to create special effects in films.The £500,000 investment includes cameras, a cinema screen and computers to monitor how joints are moving.More than 10 million UK adults seek help for arthritis each year.It can lead to pain, disability, joint damage and reduced quality of life and treatment can include drugs, physical therapies and surgery.It is hoped the new technology will help arthritis patients and people who suffer from other limb disorders by allowing experts to examine their movement.Researchers are currently studying a group of patients with knee injuries who are each fitted with infra red sensors - similar to ones used to create special effects - before taking to the treadmill.As they take part in various exercises the researchers are then able to build a digital picture of the way each patient's joints are performing.Insights from the project are being used to help develop new rehabilitation tools to ease knee joint problems.The suite puts Wales at the forefront of research into arthritis, according to Dr Paulien Roos, academic fellow at Cardiff University's Biomechanics and Bioengineering Centre."It's an excellent tool that really helps to move our research forward."Normally it would take us days or even years to calculate the measurements this tool allows us to gather."We can now get that information immediately so we can give real time feedback to patients."We can tell patients how they can improve their movement and hopefully alleviate future joint problems."One of the patients taking part in the research was Liz Evans from Newport who badly damaged her knee in a skiing accident."I was made very aware that I was going to be vulnerable to getting osteoarthritis in years to come," she said."I don't want that to hit me. I'm keen to do whatever I can to help the researchers find out more about the causes and ways of postponing the onset of arthritis."It's helped me to understand the mechanics of my injury and it's also enjoyable to use."I think that there's a wealth of knowledge that can be gained by doing all those measures and getting a greater understanding of human movement."The project is supported by Arthritis Research UK, which funds one of the researchers.The charity's regional fundraising manager for south and mid Wales, Anna-Marie Jones, said it could lead to a breakthrough."One in six in the UK suffer with arthritis and that affects the young as well as the old," she said."There are actually 15,000 children in the UK that have arthritis."By putting our funds into work like this we certainly will become nearer to finding a cure for arthritis."</body>

      <title>Pupils 'not fed enough at school'</title>
      <description>Warning some children's school lunches are not big enough</description>

      <body>Some pupils are not being given enough food at Powys primary schools causing them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member has warned.Montgomeryshire AM Russell George said parents and governors had told him 11-year-olds were being given the same portion sizes as four-year-olds.He claimed second helpings had also been banned and he intended to raise the issue with Powys council's leader.The authority said its meals met Welsh government requirements.Mr George said the issue was brought to his attention by a number of people across the county who he said felt the "extreme" school meals policy was leading to more snacking and bad dietary choices.He said the policy dictated that all primary school children received the same portion of food, regardless of age.And he said he had been told that second helpings of lunch had been stopped as the council tried to reduce waste."Parents are telling me that their children are coming home hungry, which then causes them to snack before their evening meal, all of which isn't lending itself to children leading healthy lifestyles," said the Conservative AM."Children of 10 and 11 years of age are clearly going to require different levels of nutrition to those of four and five-year-olds... this isn't rocket science."One chair of governors at a primary school in the county claimed more parents were switching their children to packed lunches because they no longer felt the school meals were offering value for money.He said he became concerned after noticing his own 10-year-old son was coming home from school hungry and that a number of other parents had raised the issue with him."I then raised it at a governor's meeting and was told that catering staff had been told that as of the start of this term additional food was not to be given," he said."I have spoken to the principal catering officer at the council and he said the rationale behind this was that he felt some schools were over-producing food."Also I think the thought is that by giving children seconds they're not going to have the balanced meal they should be getting."But what follows from that is that if you get wastage down to zero you have pupils going hungry as the portion sizes are the same for four to 11-year-olds."He said teachers were concerned that it was leading to poorer concentration from some pupils."The council's saying that all the pupils should get the same portion sizes as everyone pays the same but I think it's leading to some parents feeling that they are no longer getting value for money and are giving their children packed lunches instead," he added.A spokesperson for Powys council said dishes on school menus met the requirements of the Welsh government's Appetite for Life scheme, which aims to improve the nutritional standards of food and drink served in schools across Wales."As part of this scheme, there are recommended guidelines regarding the size of the portions. These portions have been analysed to ensure they meet the nutritional standards set out in the scheme," the spokesperson said."When planning school meals, the number of pupils who have school meals is always taken into consideration to ensure that school cooks do not over produce food and remain within their budgets."However, there will always be cases where food is left on the servery as pupils can choose whether they want a particular food on a school menu."If there is food left over, we have now advised school cooks to give out second helpings if there are pupils who want it."But we cannot overproduce food so that second helpings can be provided as this has a cost implication and also second portions are not taken into consideration when the menus are nutritionally analysed."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We would never want to see children having school meals going hungry."We've given primary schools guidance on portion sizes which cater for changing nutritional requirements as children get older. So a child in year six would have a larger portion than a child in reception."</body>

      <title>Clegg and Cable 'split' over leaks</title>
      <description>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.</description>

      <date>1381502403</date>
      <body>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his cabinet colleague Vince Cable appear at odds about the Guardian's disclosure of secret surveillance.Mr Cable said the newspaper performed a "very considerable public service" by publishing details of documents leaked by Edward Snowden.But Mr Clegg reaffirmed his belief it was "not good at all" and said the information could "help terrorists".Downing Street said the security services' review system works well.A spokesman, however, said the prime minister is ready to listen to ideas for improving the system.He was speaking as Mr Cable also called for "proper political oversight of the intelligence services".Earlier, Sir David Omand, a UK security expert and former No 10 advisor described the leaks by Mr Snowden as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".In May, Mr Snowden leaked information to the Guardian about mass surveillance programmes such as the US National Security Agency's Prism and GCHQ's Tempora operations.The Guardian has defended its decision to publish documents leaked by the former US intelligence worker, who was granted asylum in Russia, and has vowed to publish more.Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4' Today programme: "I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service."I think Mr Snowden's contribution is two-fold. One is a positive one - the whistleblowing - the other is more worrying which is a large amount of genuinely important intelligence material does seem to have been passed across."We do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now."But Mr Clegg told the BBC: "My view is that publishing information, technical information which can help terrorists work out how to do harm to us, of course, that is not good at all."But of course there is a legitimate, wider debate, an ongoing debate, about how do you make sure, as both the intelligence agencies and those who wish to do us harm, use these considerable new powers at their disposal in information technology, how do we make sure that all of that is held properly to account."Earlier this year, the Justice and Security Act 2013 gave the government's Intelligence and Security committee greater powers to scrutinise the work of the security services.Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be no review of the oversight of the security services, despite Guardian reports that Mr Clegg was to start conversations in government about one.The prime minister said on Thursday "a good legal framework" already existed.A spokesman said Mr Cameron "thinks the current system is a good one and it works well," but "if others have ideas he is prepared to listen to them".Mr Clegg responded to the question of more oversight of the security services on Friday saying the government had already "significantly strengthened the powers of oversight".But he added that "many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified".Former Home Secretary Jack Straw also hit out at the Guardian saying its stance was "indulgent irresponsibility" which did not help protect the public.His comments come in an interview to be broadcast on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales.He said the Guardian had a "sense of power of having these secrets and excitement... about these secrets has gone to their heads"."They are blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are - are or not - likely to damage the national interest," said Mr Straw.Sir David, who is also a former head of the UK's communications surveillance centre GCHQ, told The Times there needed to be a difference acknowledged between whistleblowing to spark a debate and "the stealing of 58,000 top-secret British security documents" which he called "seriously, seriously damaging"."The assumption the experts are working on is that all that information or almost all of it will now be in the hands of Moscow and Beijing," he added.Nigel Inkster, who was director of operations and intelligence at MI6, and is now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told BBC Radio 4 programme The World at One he agreed with Sir David.He said terrorists would have a better awareness of how vulnerable it was to communicate with each other "via any one or any group of communications options that are available to them".He added that in terms of state-on-state espionage, "some of the reach and sophistication of the systems and capabilities developed by NSA and GCHQ have now been compromised".</body>

      <title>Royal Mail shares jump sharply</title>
      <description>Shares in Royal Mail rise as high as 456p in conditional trading - up 38% on their initial 330p offer price - before easing back.</description>

      <date>1381493626</date>
      <body>Royal Mail shares rose more than 38% to 456p at the start of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p per share, valuing the 500-year-old company at £3.3bn. The value rose £1.1bn after trading began.At midday, the shares had eased back to 435p, 31.8% up. Private investors received 227 shares each.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Business Secretary Vince Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <title>Plaid's pledge to cut energy bills</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, addressing the party conference, announces plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24457978</url>
      <date>1381503345</date>
      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has announced plans to set up a body to drive down energy bills for everyone in Wales.Energy Wales would buy gas and electricity at wholesale prices and sell direct to consumers and firms, she told the Aberystwyth conference.Surpluses would be spit between protecting customers and expanding energy efficiency measures.Ms Wood said the firm would work as an arms-length company like Welsh Water."When Labour's energy price freeze begins to thaw and prices begin to spike again, Plaid Cymru would have enabled the building of our cheaper, permanent, people-powered Welsh alternative," she said.In her second annual conference speech since being elected party leader, she said Plaid would recruit 1,000 extra doctors if it won the assembly election in 2016.This would be financed by a sugary drink levy of up to 20p per litre, she said.She also announced radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales over the next assembly term.Ms Wood also announced an "alternative way forward" on hospital reorganisation plans.Labour has accused her of blocking a controversial shake-up of some specialist services without suggesting alternatives.Welsh Labour ministers have insisted closing some hospitals and moving some core services from smaller to larger hospitals are essential to make the NHS safe and sustainable.Some of the most controversial have been in south Wales, with opposition to proposals to move key specialist care from Llantrisant's Royal Glamorgan hospital as part of changes at five health boards.Ms Wood said Plaid was committed to delivering a better Welsh NHS with 1,000 extra doctors."We will provide more doctors so these services can stay open and stay safe," she said.Money would be raised by levy of up to 20p a litre on sugary drinks."If a thousand extra doctors sounds over-ambitious consider this."With them, Wales would only be brought up to the UK average - so we must have those extra doctors."She told party members this would help provide a more efficient NHS, as would plans to better integrate hospitals and social care "to get patients out of hospital and back into their own home".The Plaid leader said funding to begin this integration had already been won as part of a package of measures the party had this week announced with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers in a deal on the Welsh budget.Ms Wood said there was a "crisis of obesity and diabetes that was killing us as a nation."She also unveiled radical proposals to reintroduce rent controls for the 190,000 households renting in Wales, over the next assembly term.Plaid has said previously Wales can learn from how Norway, Germany and Denmark have offered modern hospital care without centralisation.The party has argued planning the NHS workforce more effectively and better recruitment practices would help reduce some of the strains on the health service.Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru was the only party addressing people's big concerns at the 2016 assembly election and that "Wales is better than this".Ms Wood started her speech by saying Plaid would build on recent momentum.She said this would "carry us forward over the finishing line" to win the assembly election in 2016."It isn't a sprint but a marathon and I'm firing the starting pistol here today."She said she was committed to Plaid being the next government of Wales "so we can build Wales up, turn around the economic situation, stand on our own two feet."Plaid Cymru also points to the budget deal it signed with the Liberal Democrats and Welsh ministers earlier in the week which put more money into treating patients in the community as a way of both improving services and keeping more patients out of hospital.All party members who attend the two-day conference will be able to vote on the motions debated. Until now that was reserved for delegates representing various sections of the party.The change is part of internal reforms brought in following Plaid Cymru's disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election.Ms Wood promoted plans to cut business rates for smaller firms on the opening day of the two-day Aberystwyth event.Firms would qualify for reduced business rates if their rateable values was below £15,000, rather than £12,000 under the current regime.A rateable value below £10,000 would mean paying no business rates, rather than the £6,000 ceiling at present.Ms Wood has also defended her party's election performances since devolution.With the SNP in government in Scotland, she was asked on BBC Radio Wales why the Scottish nationalists had moved so much further on than Plaid."I think it reflects the different settlement that Wales has had compared to Scotland," said Ms Wood."Scotland is so much further ahead in terms of the devolution settlement and Wales is in a different place."Our settlement is much weaker as is our economic situation and that's why I've said since I've become the leader of Plaid Cymru that the economy and job creation should be our number one priority."I would argue that Scotland has got a government that puts Scotland first and Scottish communities first at every opportunity and Wales needs a government now that will do that and I would argue that a Plaid Cymru government after 2016 is what the country needs now."SNP MP Pete Wishart urged Plaid activists to join in with the campaign.To enthusiastic applause, he told the conference: "We will win, because independence is the aspiration...that puts the future of Scotland in the hands of the people who live and work in Scotland."</body>

      <description>Gay and lesbian people seeking asylum in the UK from persecution abroad are being ordered to "prove" their sexuality to immigration officers, MPs say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24479812</url>
      <date>1381446481</date>
      <body>Gay and lesbian people seeking asylum in the UK from persecution abroad are being ordered to "prove" their sexuality, MPs have said.In extreme cases claimants had handed over photographic and video evidence of "highly personal sexual activity" in an effort to persuade officials, the Home Affairs Committee found.The gay rights group Stonewall called the testing system "distressing".The Home Office promised to monitor and maintain standards.In its report on the asylum system, the committee said it was concerned by the quality of the UK Border Agency's decision-making, as 30% of appeals against initial decisions had been allowed in 2012.And a backlog of 32,600 asylum cases that should have been resolved in 2011 was yet to be concluded, while the number of applicants still waiting for an initial decision after six months had risen by 63% last year.Some had been waiting up to 16 years, while the housing with which they were provided was sometimes "appalling".It also said poor decision-making by officials was raising the risk of the UK harbouring war criminals.The committee also focused on the situation facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people seeking asylum.In its report, the committee said they faced "extraordinary obstacles" in persuading immigration officers of their case.Its chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, told BBC News: "It is absurd for a judge or a caseworker to have to ask an individual to prove that they are lesbian or gay, to ask them what kind of films they watch, what kind of material they read."People should accept the statement of sexuality by those who seek asylum. This practice is regrettable and ought to be stopped immediately."A Supreme Court ruling in 2010 stated that the "underlying rationale" of the United Nations Refugee Convention was that people should be able to "live freely and openly" in their own country without fear of persecution.This judgement, the committee said, had effectively overturned the Border Agency's previous emphasis on "voluntary discretion" - which had meant it should be seen an option for claimants to conceal their sexuality in order to avoid abuse.The report said: "The battleground is now firmly centred in 'proving' that they are gay. In turn, this has led to claimants going to extreme lengths to try and meet the new demands of credibility assessment in this area, including the submission of photographic and video evidence of highly personal sexual activity to caseworkers, presenting officers and the judiciary."The committee said: "We were concerned to hear that the decision making process for LGBTI applicants relies so heavily on anecdotal evidence and 'proving that they are gay'."It added that "it is not appropriate to force people to prove their sexuality if there is a perception that they are gay. The assessment of credibility is an area of weakness within the British asylum system."Furthermore, the fact that credibility issues disproportionately affect the most vulnerable applicants - victims of domestic and sexual violence, victims of torture and persecution because of their sexuality - makes improvement all the more necessary."The Refugee Council said the committee's report reflected its "grave concerns" about the UK asylum system.Chief Executive Maurice Wren said: "Failing to treat asylum seekers with dignity and, simultaneously, failing to deal effectively and fairly with their claims has created an expensive and counter-productive bureaucratic nightmare that all too often denies vulnerable people the protection from persecution and oppression they desperately need."Stonewall says LGBTI people in some countries have suffered rape, torture and death threats.Spokesman Richard Lane said: "Being gay isn't about what nightclubs you go to; it is a fundamental part of who you are."Sadly, in far too many cases, valuable time is spent attempting to 'prove' a claimant is gay in this way rather than establishing whether they have a legitimate fear of persecution."This is not only a waste of time and resources but can be deeply distressing to asylum seekers, many of who have fled for fear of their lives."A Home Office spokesman said: "The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it. We are committed to concluding all cases as quickly as possible, but asylum cases are often complex and require full and thorough consideration."We have robust mechanisms in place to monitor standards of housing provided to asylum seekers."He added: "We will continue to monitor performance to ensure that standards are met."</body>

      <title>We have problem with women - Tory MP</title>
      <description>Male Conservatives must rethink their attitudes and behaviour towards women, says Tory MP Bernard Jenkin.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24491440</url>
      <date>1381491717</date>
      <body>Male Conservatives must rethink their attitudes and behaviour to women or be "left behind", a Tory MP has said.Writing in the House magazine, Bernard Jenkin said many Tory men feel "women's issues" should be left to women "so men can get on with running the country".The lack of women in the upper reaches of government and the party was proof of the culture change needed, he added."We have perhaps yet to understand what change in the Conservative Party really means," he claimed.Monday's coalition reshuffle was seen as an attempt to boost the proportion of female ministers in government and to promote more women to senior positions.Among those to get promotions were Esther McVey, Jane Ellison and Nicky Morgan.Anna Soubry broke new ground by becoming the first ever female defence minister - after complaining that she had been given her previous role as public health minister because David Cameron thought only a woman could do a "soft bloody girly" job.Mr Cameron has said he wants a third of ministers to be women by the end of the Parliament 2015.But of the 32 ministers entitled to attend Cabinet, currently only five are women.Opinion polls have suggested the government's popularity among female voters has fallen sharply since 2010 although a recent Ipsos-Mori survey suggested the three main party leaders could all do more to address women's concerns.Mr Cameron has come under fire from Labour critics in the past for allegedly sexist attitudes towards female MPs, particularly after he told shadow minister Angela Eagle to "calm down, dear," during prime minister's questions.But the prime minister has always rejected claims he and his party have a problem with attracting women voters.Labour has used all-women shortlists to boost its number of female MPs and leader Ed Miliband has said his aim is to have a shadow cabinet that is 50% woman.The Conservatives have always resisted all-women shortlists, arguing that they unfair and patronising - and that women should be promoted on merit rather than gender.The Lib Dems, who have the smallest percentage of female MPs among the three main parties, just seven out of 57 MPs, are understood to be considering all-women shortlists.But Mr Jenkin suggested the problem lay at the top of government, such as the all-male "quad" of David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, who make the key coalition decisions.And it was a question of ingrained attitudes within the Conservative Party."Many of us Tory men tend to feel that 'women' can deal with 'women's issues', so men can get on with running the country."The Quad are all men. The National Security Council is overwhelmingly men. The Tory high command (David Cameron, George Osborne and Lynton Crosby) are all men."Only three out of 25 on the Party Board are women. Most of the advisers and policy wonks are men."And of course, most MPs will continue to be men. It is going to take a long time to change all this, so what else must we change? We should look at how we all behave."An MP since 1992, Mr Jenkin was once in charge of efforts to make the Conservative parliamentary party more diverse, by getting more female and ethnic minority candidates elected. He now chairs the public administration select committee.All men were guilty of "unconscious slights to women", Mr Jenkin added, but women voters "see it and feel it" when senior politicians do it."A business change programme would involve zero tolerance of such behaviour. We have perhaps yet to understand what "change" in the Conservative Party really means.""It is not something the leadership does, or women can do for us. Every man in the Conservative Party needs to change or be left behind. The leadership needs to be on this 24-7-365, not just at reshuffle time."Labour said the Conservatives were simply "out of touch" with the challenges facing women in the current financial climate."It is a problem which goes right up to David Cameron and has seen women disproportionately affected by his government's cost of living crisis," said shadow equalities minister Gloria De Piero."While nearly half of Labour's shadow cabinet are women, David Cameron has only four women in his top team of 22. That says it all."However, former home secretary Jacqui Smith recently criticised the absence of a woman in Labour's 2015 general election planning team.</body>

      <title>Rifkind spy scrutiny role questioned</title>
      <description>A former senior intelligence official questions whether an MP from the governing party should chair the committee scrutinising Britain's security services but Sir Malcolm Rifkind defends his role.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24491443</url>
      <date>1381500241</date>
      <body>A former senior intelligence official has questioned the impartiality of the committee scrutinising Britain's security services.Sir Francis Richards said it was "not a very good idea" for an ex-Conservative minister to head Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.But Sir Malcolm Rifkind said he was well placed to do the job as he had "handled intelligence" as a minister.It follows questions about intelligence leaked by US whistleblower Ed Snowden.Sir David Omand, a former UK homeland security adviser, has suggested the public disclosure of thousands of top-secret files by former CIA spy Edward Snowden was the most "catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".The episode has raised questions about the oversight of the British security services, with Business Secretary Vince Cable among those urging a review of current arrangements.The Guardian - which published the original revelations about the data-gathering and surveillance activities of the US National Security Agency and its relationship with UK agencies - has suggested that a debate was starting in government about updating the way politicians oversee the security services.The intelligence and security committee has access to classified intelligence material and holds its meetings in private for security reasons.Reporting to Parliament, it publishes an annual review of the UK's intelligence policy as well as the administration and funding of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.Its remit was expanded earlier this year to cover operational matters, as well as the intelligence-related work of other government agencies such as the Joint Intelligence Committee, the National Security Secretariat, the Defence Intelligence department in the Ministry of Defence and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Sir Malcolm, a former foreign and defence secretary under John Major, was appointed to chair the committee by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010.Sir Francis Richards, a career diplomat and former director of the GCHQ listening post, said he did not doubt Sir Malcolm's qualifications or ability to do the job but questioned whether he is "well-placed to command confidence".Sir Malcolm told BBC Radio 4's World At One, that the committee was "completely bipartisan" and the views he expressed as chairman were those of the whole committee, which has members from all parties."I'm perfectly happy to criticise and attack the government if they do something silly or stupid," he added."Quite a number of people on the Intelligence and Security Committee are former ministers because we are people who've actually handled intelligence. We've had to deal with it as users of the product."We are responsible for deciding whether the security services do something dumb or stupid or illegal and if they do, we are prepared to be very very brutal with them."Sir Malcolm also said those calling for more scrutiny "seemed to have forgotten" that the government had "dramatically increased" the powers of the committee.No 10 has insisted there is no government review of oversight of the security services and the prime minister thinks the current system is working effectively.But he said it was open to members of the National Security Council and the Privy Council to ask the security agencies questions, and he said David Cameron was prepared to listen to ideas from others.Mr Clegg told the BBC that the ISC's powers had already been "significantly strengthened" but there was an "ongoing debate" about whether more needed to be done."And I think many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified," he said.</body>

      <title>Driving test age rise considered</title>
      <description>Teenagers could have to wait a year longer before being allowed to take their driving test under proposals being considered by the government.</description>

      <body>Teenagers could have to wait a year longer than currently before they are allowed to take their driving test.The government is considering issuing only 12-month probationary licences at the age of 18 in a bid to cut accidents involving young motorists.New drivers would also face a curfew between 22:00 and 05:00 unless a passenger aged over 30 was in the car.Ministers are due to publish a Green Paper this year after considering the Transport Research Laboratory's report.It recommends a one-year "learner stage" beginning at 17, during which drivers would have to total at least 100 hours of daytime and 20 hours of night-time practice under supervision.Learners can then take their test at 18 and, if they pass, will get a probationary licence and have to display a green "P" plate.During this stage, drivers will face the curfew and all those under 30 will be banned from carrying any passengers also under 30.Other proposals under consideration for young drivers are a ban on all mobile phone use, including hands-free phones, and a lower alcohol limit.After the 12-month probationary period, drivers will automatically graduate to a full licence and unrestricted driving.Statistics show that more than a fifth of deaths on British roads in 2011 involved drivers aged 17-24.The report suggests implementing this new system could cut annual casualty numbers by 4,471 and save £224m.A Department for Transport spokesman said: "Young drivers drive around 5% of all the miles driven in Britain but are involved in about 20% of the crashes where someone is killed or seriously injured."We are committed to improving safety for young drivers and reducing their insurance costs - that is why we are publishing a Green Paper later in the year setting out our proposals."This will include a discussion about how people learn to drive."The research report has been produced by the Transport Research Laboratory under commission by the Department for Transport and it, amongst other things, has informed the Green Paper."Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation motoring research charity, welcomed the proposals.He said: "Young people are four times more likely to die in a road accident than as a result of drink or drugs."Yet, as a society we seem to turn a blind eye to the carnage. If this was any other area of public health there would be an outcry."This is about ensuring their long-term safety and mobility. Not curtailing it."Edmund King, president of motoring organisation the AA, said the proposals were addressing the problem of young drivers in the "wrong way"."You should prepare young drivers to be safe when they get their licence rather than give them their licence and then restrict them," he told BBC's Breakfast.He said he would like to see mandatory lessons on motorways, in rural areas and in bad weather, and warned of the problems of policing the restrictions such as carrying young passengers.Julie Townsend, of road safety charity Brake, welcomed the report, saying it was further recognition of the compelling case for graduated driver licensing.She urged the government to act "swiftly and decisively" to commit to the system to help reduce the danger young drivers posed to themselves and others.Currently drivers in England, Scotland and Wales need to pass a theory test, then a practical test before they can apply for a full driving licence. The minimum age to hold a full car licence is 17, or 16 for some people claiming mobility benefit.Your commentsMy son is 12-years-old and has had five lessons with a young drivers school. Why doesn't the government promote these in school? They give kids the chance to learn at a early age to drive sensibly. These school are run throughout the country but even after taking lessons they don't get any credit from insurance companies. Let's look at this instead of increasing the age of driving. Rod Peart, Carlisle, CumbriaI think it is great to raise the age, set out curfews and limit the amount of hours that these kids need to practice before taking their test. My son is now 18-years-old, but he had a lot of practice on the road and passed second time round. He seems very aware of the dangers. But not all his peers are the same - at least three of them have had accidents during their first few weeks of driving - at least two of those accidents were because they were showing off to each other. Go on - raise the age and add some curfews. Gael Atkinson, SussexI am 17-years-of-age and have been learning for the past four months and I am almost ready to take my test. Whilst on my driving lessons my instructor and I see countless people over the age of 30 driving dangerously. Age is not the problem, maturity is. My family have been in few collisions where people over the age of fifty haven't looked or couldn't control their car. Where are the limitations for them?Reanne, Exeter, DevonMy 19-year-old son has recently passed his test and my 17-year-old will be wanting lessons at some point. We live in a rural area where there is little public transport. This suggestion would mean that my 17-year-old son would not be able to take up a night shift job to support himself or drive to school. Rather than fiddle about with difficult to enforce curfews, etc. for young drivers, would it not be better to have a more rigorous driving test, involving motorways, rural roads and night driving?John Hall, Steeple Bumpstead, EssexAs a driving instructor I welcome these proposals. We need to get people talking about how we can improve the skills of new drivers. The statistics for accidents involving young drivers are horrific. The probationary licence for new drivers sounds like a good idea in theory although we kind of have that at the moment, as if you accrue six points in your first year of driving you will have to resit your test. I myself would be in favour of a longer test with all the manoeuvres and motorway driving looked at. Steve Kirk, Bolton, Greater ManchesterIt should be raised to the age of 21. This would reduce accidents, free up roads, increase use of public transport, make young people walk or cycle thereby promoting health and energy, ensure that some maturity and responsibility in life was achieved prior to driving, and would reduce insurance costs for all. I have three sons, all aged over 23, only one drives having passed his test at the age of 22. Gary Stapleton Harrogate, North YorkshireBy the time teenagers learn to drive they are expected to take contract buses into college, or get public transport to work or apprenticeships. The price of these go up way higher than the rate of inflation and it's clearly forcing everyone onto the road. It's not just teenagers who are being involved in accidents! A lot of colleagues at school will have to take more money from their parents to be able to pay for transport. They will be even more dependent on their parents. I, myself, haven't learned to drive yet, I am 18 and am starting driving lessons soon. I just think that these sort of measures are driving the country into some Orwellian Police State.Miles, Fareham</body>

      <title>Be part of NI success story: Cameron</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron says Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.</description>

      <date>1381499978</date>
      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has said Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.Mr Cameron was addressing a major investment conference in Belfast.He urged foreign investors to "put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story"."Some people say it's a bit undignified for a prime minster to make a sales pitch, I say nonsense," he said."I'm passionate about the power of business to create jobs and growth and I'm passionate about what Northern Ireland has to offer, and so I'm here today with a very simple message."Put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story because investing in Northern Ireland makes good business sense."Mr Cameron told the conference at Belfast's Titanic Building that Northern Ireland had put on a "great G8" during the summer."What was seen this summer was a new Northern Ireland open for business, ready for investment, strengthening the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity and determined to be defined not by divided past but by shared future," he said."With over 800 foreign investors, Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment, with almost 8,000 jobs from foreign investment in the last three years alone."Mr Cameron also visited the east Belfast factory of the aerospace company Bombardier, which said it will create at least 250 new jobs in the city over the next 12 months.On Thursday, it emerged the company hopes a future research programme will employ an additional 230 people.Speaking at Stormont Castle at the end of the conference, Mr Cameron condemned the murders of two men in Belfast and Londonderry."These murders are despicable and the people responsible should be hunted down prosecuted and convicted, they should face justice," he said.Mr Cameron said that investors believed Northern Ireland was a "safe and secure" place to do business.He said that First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness had taken risks for peace and that they would continue to take risks to ensure there was progress."They come from very different political parties, different traditions but they work together for the people of Northern Ireland," Mr Cameron added.Earlier, the first and deputy first ministers said Northern Ireland has much to offer international investors.Mr Robinson said Northern Ireland has "many of the building blocks in place" to take its economy to a "higher level".Mr McGuinness said the country had a young, educated workforce and offered a high standard of living.Mr Robinson said the key to moving Northern Ireland forward as one community was creating jobs and promoting social inclusion.He said at the heart of the Northern Ireland Executive's programme for government was the creation of a vibrant economy."The reaction we often get from potential investors who take the time to come here is that 'we didn't think that Northern Ireland had so much to offer,'" he said.Mr Robinson also joked that he hoped those attending the conference had enjoyed a traditional healthy, fat-free Northern Ireland breakfast.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness told delegates that Northern Ireland was a "very safe place to invest and to live, with very low crime levels".He said existing inward investors had been impressed with what Northern Ireland had to offer, including its "young educated workforce", excellent telecommunications infrastructure, government support and its location as a "gateway to Europe".Mr McGuinness said people in Northern Ireland had a "strong work ethic" and more than 60% of school leavers continued their studies by taking either further or higher education courses.The deputy first minister also praised the quality of life in Northern Ireland. He told investors that they would never be more than an hour's drive from either the sea or the mountains, and could enjoy first class golfing and fishing facilities.Speaking at the conference on Friday morning, Northern Ireland Economy Minister Arlene Foster said Mr Cameron had fulfilled a commitment he had made during the summer, when the prime minister hosted the G8 summit in County Fermanagh.She said he had promised in June to return to Northern Ireland to promote the role he believes it can play in the wider UK economy, and she added that the business event was part of the "economic legacy of the G8".Ms Foster said she was "very confident that there will be investment after this conference".The economy minister was asked if the murders of Kevin Kearney and Barry McCrory, who were shot dead within 48 hours in Belfast and Londonderry, had overshadowed the event.Ms Foster said: "Obviously those of us who live here are shocked and horrified that those sorts of murders can take place on our streets."However, she added: "We've been focusing on talking to the delegates about the good things in Northern Ireland - that fact that we have such good skills here, and if people invest in Northern Ireland they will definitely get value for money."The conference is the first event of its kind in Northern Ireland, since the global downturn began in 2008.</body>

      <title>Rise in council tax court summonses</title>
      <description>Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken to court in England for non-payment of council tax as a result of the government's benefit changes, the Labour Party says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24482948</url>
      <date>1381479682</date>
      <body>Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken to court in England for non-payment of council tax owing to benefit changes, according to the Labour Party.Labour said 112 English councils had reported issuing 156,000 court summonses since April to people paying more tax as a result of the changes.That meant 450,000 individuals may have been taken to court across the whole of England in six months, it claimed.But Local Government minister Brandon Lewis said the survey was "misleading".He told the BBC there had been about three million summonses in the last year of the Labour government and the situation was now "getting much better".Labour asked all 326 billing authorities in England how many court summonses they had issued following the change to council tax benefit in April.It said the 112 authorities that responded were from a representative cross-section of councils, in terms of population density and deprivation, and extrapolating the numbers for the whole of England meant that as many as 450,000 individuals may have been taken to court since April.Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said Prime Minister David Cameron needed "to wake up to what's happening across the country"."People on the lowest income are struggling to pay his council tax rises."This is exactly what happened with the Poll Tax, as many are disabled people, veterans and carers," he said.Pete Lumb, from Hornsea, a small seaside town in the East Riding area of Yorkshire, is one of the individuals that has received a court summons.He is unemployed and has suffered with mental health problems. Living in a small bedsit, he says he has around £70 a week to live on.Since April, the council has been asking him for a few pounds a week extra towards the council tax - money he says he simply doesn't have."The chances of me getting a job are pretty much nil. I feel society just wants rid of me. I feel a complete and utter failure," he says.He's worried the next step will be bailiffs coming round.East Riding Council said that the changes to council tax benefit were "entirely the result of government policy and not anything decided by this council".It has encouraged anyone struggling to pay council tax to contact the authority at the earliest possible stage.Before April of this year, millions of people on low income in England paid no council tax at all, or had their bill substantially reduced. The council tax benefit system was then replaced.The government said this was part of a wider package of changes designed to control the spiralling cost of welfare - and encourage councils to find ways of helping those on benefits into work.It reduced the overall level of funding by 10% and said each council should decide how much support to offer residents - although pensioners were protected from any cut.Some councils managed to find savings elsewhere and absorb the funding reduction, thereby maintaining the level of support for low-income households. The benefit cuts were not passed on in Scotland or Wales.The majority of authorities in England, however, said they had no option but to ask some of the poorest residents for money. Many had never paid council tax before.Often, these residents have been asked for just a few pounds a week extra. But that can add up to hundreds of pounds a year.Already there have been reports of queues forming outside magistrates courts on certain days of the week, as the number of cases of non-payment increases.The Citizens Advice Bureau in Hull said it dealt with 1,000 cases last August, but by this August the number had risen to 3,000.But Mr Lewis said Labour's survey was "shoddy" and that official statistics "show arrears have fallen, and the amount of council tax collected has increased"."It is nothing like a full survey of the country," he told BBC Radio 5Live."I think it is really bad that the Labour Party just want to use something like this to scaremonger and to make political points in what is a really serious issue about dealing with our welfare problems."Mr Lewis said a £100m hardship fund had been made available to councils to support people struggling to pay their council tax, on top of the funding already given to local government."There is no interest for a council to get in a situation where people can't pay and they should be working with people...to ensure that they can protect the most vulnerable," he added."They don't need to be increasing the charges on people."The government does not have its own figures for the number of court summonses since April.Officials emphasise that every year there are a high number of court summonses for non-payment of council tax.Labour said it had asked councils for specific numbers of cases as a result of the changes to council tax benefit, so the total in its survey represents the extra number of summonses - those people who haven't paid council tax until now, or have been asked to pay more since April.</body>

      <title>Drop EU push, Tory MPs urge Afriyie</title>
      <description>More than 100 Tory MPs urge their colleague Adam Afriyie to drop his call for a referendum on the UK's European Union membership to be brought forward to next year.</description>

      <body>More than 100 Tory MPs have written to their colleague Adam Afriyie urging him to drop his call for a referendum on the UK's European Union membership to be brought forward to next year.Prime Minister David Cameron has said such a vote will take place in 2017 if his party wins a majority.But Mr Afriyie has said he will try to force a Commons vote on holding a referendum in October 2014.He told the BBC he would "push through" to give people a "voice".The Conservative leadership has dismissed the idea.Mr Cameron says the proposed 2017 date is necessary to allow time for a full renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels before the public is offered a say on whether to leave or remain in the EU.But Mr Afriyie has said he will table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday, arguing that the next 12 months provide "ample time" for discussions.However, 143 of the 147 Conservative MPs first elected to Parliament in 2010 have written to Mr Afriyie, saying: "We believe that the bill before the House provides in its current form the best opportunity to secure this outcome, in part because of its uncomplicated, unambiguous nature. This gives the bill the best chance of progressing through the House."So, whilst we recognise the sense of urgency reflected in your amendment, we feel that this will jeopardise the progress of legislation and the prospect of a referendum."Knowing that you value and respect the views of colleagues, we hope and request that you withdraw support for the amendment tabled in your name."But Mr Afriyie refused to back down when he appeared on BBC One's Question Time, saying: "I believe that the British people have to have a say."He added: "We've got a political elite, a political class who say it's not the right time... I would rather be on the side of the British people than a political elite that just wants to deny them a voice."Mr Afriyie, MP for Windsor, also said: "I come from a tough background. I was dragged up in Peckham... I've had some challenges in my time. I always push through."The bill which Mr Afriyie is seeking to amend was tabled by backbench Conservative MP James Wharton in an attempt to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law. Yet it lacks the support of the Liberal Democrats.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.</body>

      <title>Dwarf jibe MP 'can work with Bercow'</title>

      <body>A Conservative MP who once called House of Commons Speaker John Bercow a "stupid, sanctimonious dwarf" has insisted the pair can work together if he is elected as his deputy.Simon Burns told The House magazine it was not necessary to be "closest of friends" to gel professionally.Mr Burns stood down as a transport minister earlier this week to run for the deputy Speakership.The Speaker has said he is "entirely untroubled" by the remarks.Mr Burns, MP for Chelmsford, has had a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow, who was himself a Tory MP before taking on his current job in 2009.During a testy exchange in the Commons in 2010, Mr Burns, then a health minister, insulted Mr Bercow about his height. He later apologised to a group representing people with dwarfism for any offence caused, but not to the Speaker himself.It was greeted with some surprise at Westminster last week when Mr Burns revealed he was running for the deputy Speakership vacated by Nigel Evans, who stood down last month after he was charged with sexual offences.But Mr Burns told the House: "The deputy Speakers are elected by and responsible to the House of Commons and they work closely with the Speaker. It is no secret that the Speaker and I are not the closest of friends, but you do not need to be close friends to carry out the job successfully."In all my jobs in Parliament, whether in government or opposition, I have always behaved in a highly professional way, working with a wide range of different people."I have no reason to doubt that the Speaker is equally professional and we would be able to forge a professional working relationship, to the benefit of the smooth running of the House."The election for the deputy Speaker's role takes place next week. Other candidates include Tory MP Nadine Dorries, another vocal critic of Mr Bercow.</body>

      <title>Illegal migrants face new crackdown</title>
      <description>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned new laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.</description>

      <body>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.The Immigration Bill would force private landlords to quiz tenants about their immigration status and restrict access to bank accounts for people in the country without permission.It also aims to streamline the appeals process in immigration cases.Labour said the bill did nothing about bigger problems like the "shambolic" state of UK border controls.The bill, which is expected to become law in spring 2014, subject to approval by MPs, will include measures to allow the UK to "deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeal later" when there is "no risk of serious irreversible harm".BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani says this could lead to an increase in air fare costs for the Home Office, if it has to fly back migrants who are successful in their appeal.A requirement is also included for temporary migrants, such as overseas students, to make a contribution to the National Health Service to prevent so-called "health tourism".Other new measures in the bill include:Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The Immigration Bill will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled, reduce the pull factors which encourage people to come to the UK and make it easier to remove people who should not be here."We will continue to welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society and play by the rules. But the law must be on the side of people who respect it, not those who break it."Mrs May said the measures were about "making it harder for people who are here illegally to stay here".She said it was a "point of principle" that people who used public services should be expected to contribute to them, but she would not comment on the cost to the country of "health tourism".She denied claims that forcing private landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants would be unworkable, saying they would just be "required to ask some simple questions" in the same way that employers have to do when interviewing workers.But an organisation representing private and public sector landlords said the measures would "make it much harder for non-British people to access housing even when they have a legal right to live in the UK".Gavin Smart, director of policy and practice at the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: "Checking immigration status is complicated so landlords may shy away from letting to anyone who appears not to be British."Don Flynn, director of Migrants' Rights Network, criticised moves to restrict access to the NHS, saying: "There are very small numbers of migrants who come here with pre-existing health conditions and find themselves registering with the health service."I simply do not believe there is any significant evidence that something like the NHS is a pull factor."The British Medical Association (BMA) is also critical of the plans.Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, told BBC Radio 5live there is already a system in place for hospitals to recover the cost of treating patients who are ineligible for NHS care."Clearly that could be improved, but introducing a system for general practice could be a bureaucratic nightmare," he said."The reality is people don't come to the UK to use the NHS, they're more likely to come to work in the NHS."Labour said there was nothing in the bill to tackle problems at the UK's "increasingly shambolic" border controls or to deal with "long delays in getting electronic checks in place, or the UKBA (UK Border Agency) bureaucratic failings that have prevented foreign criminals being deported".Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "It doesn't seem to address some of the serious issues around border control and some of the problems about exploitation of immigration in the labour market, particularly low-skill immigration, which has caused concerns about jobs and wages."Campaign group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants welcomed what it claimed was a "climb down" by the Home Office, which had not included in the bill proposals to introduce immigration checks by GPs.It said the new proposals would deter students from wanting to study in the UK but would have "no impact whatsoever on 'illegal' immigration - the declared intention of this bill".UKIP said "pressganging landlords, doctors and private citizens under the threat of sanctions to carry out the work of border agencies is simply wrong" and the government needed to treat the cause of immigration problems rather than the symptoms.And Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, warned that some of the government's rhetoric was starting to make the UK "look unwelcoming and hostile to the people on whom our export markets depend".The Conservatives say they want to reduce net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to less than 100,000 a year.But the latest Office for National Statistics figures show net migration rose to 176,000 in the year ending December 2012 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012 - appearing to buck the recent downward trend.There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000 but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was more like 1.1 million.</body>

      <title>Bookies' roulette stakes unchanged</title>
      <description>The government resists calls to cut the £100-a-spin stake limit on roulette machines in betting shops - and more than doubles stakes and prizes on gaming machines in casinos.</description>

      <body>Gamblers will continue to be able to bet up to £100 a spin on electronic roulette machines in bookmakers' shops, the government has confirmed.Ministers acknowledged concerns that fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT) can cause addiction and even violence.But the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it wanted to protect gambling industry jobs and profits.It did, however, warn the industry it had to co-operate with research into the potential harm caused by FOBTs.The DCMS also announced that the maximum payout for gambling machines in casinos would go up from £4,000 to £10,000, with the maximum stake for such machines to more than double from £2 to £5.Casinos will also be able to offer "progressive" jackpot prizes of up to £20,000.Regulations will be laid before parliament by the end of the year, with the new rules coming into force early in 2014.Sports minister Helen Grant said: "The government is pleased to introduce a package that supports the gambling sector but is very clear that growth cannot be pursued at any cost."Our response acknowledges gambling's contribution to the economy but balances this with explicit recognition of the need to protect players, particularly at the higher end stakes."The government had been widely expected not to take any action on FOBTs at this stage, as the scope of its triennial review of Labour's 2005 Gambling Act was limited to maximising the industry's profits in a socially responsible way and boosting growth.Unlike fruit machines in pubs and amusement arcades, gamblers can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on FOBTs. The maximum payout is £500.Despite a limit being imposed of four terminals per shop, FOBTs account for almost half the big bookmakers' annual profits and have led to an explosion in new bookmakers' shops on the High Street, often in deprived areas.The government admitted that the "potential for harm (from FOBT machines), even among players who are not problem gamblers, is high" and it conceded there was "very significant public concern" about them.Local authorities have also received reports of "customers damaging machines in anger and making threats to shops staff" after using them, according to a DCMS summary of responses to its consultation.But, the report concludes, "while it is clear that reducing stakes on (FOBT) machines by varying degrees would have an adverse economic impact on the betting industry, it is currently not clear how great an impact a reduction would have on gambling related harm," the report added."In the immediate term, we expect the betting industry to make real and rapid progress on understanding harm and on developing much better harm mitigation measures."The industry has been accused by watchdog The Gambling Commission of refusing to hand over data on player behaviour, such as the speed of play, to aid researchers investigating whether the machines are addictive.The Responsible Gambling Trust research is due to be published next year. Campaigners, including Lib Dem minister Don Foster, who last month secured his party's backing for action to curb FOBTs, hope this will lead to a crackdown in stakes and prizes.The betting giants have promised a new voluntary code of conduct aimed at protecting vulnerable players by allowing them to self-exclude or limit their own stakes.But campaigners against FOBTs claim such measures have been tried in the past without success and the only way to limit harm is to reduce the amount gamblers can wager and the speed of play.According to figures from the Gambling Commission, the gross profit from FOBTs in 2012 was £1.4bn.</body>

      <title>The land of hope is Tory - Cameron</title>
      <description>David Cameron says the Tories are the party of "the many, not the few" in a conference speech also trailing possible benefit cuts for young people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>

      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24163335</url>
      <date>1379689172</date>
      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Total gay blood ban 'is irrational'</title>
      <description>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge rules</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24494371</url>
      <date>1381502282</date>
      <body>The lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland is irrational, a judge has ruled.He also held that Health Minister Edwin Poots breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive.The judge gave the verdict in a challenge brought by an unidentified homosexual man.The complete ban, put in place during the 1980s, was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.It was replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago.The 12-month deferral was left in place following a Government Advisory Committee report.It identified a much shorter period during which infection with blood-borne viruses could not be detected.Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety.But a gay man granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability launched a judicial review challenge to Mr Poots' position on blood donation.The judge heard claims that the minister displayed apparent bias that went beyond religious beliefs and into the realms of prejudice.It was revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.Attorney General John Larkin QC, the chief legal adviser to the Stormont Executive, questioned the legitimacy of the challenge.He claimed the challenge was a waste of time because the applicant had previously had sex for money.Mr Larkin rejected arguments that the issue required full executive approval and questioned whether the minister had made a decision to maintain the current ban.However, the judge said that in continuing the lifetime deferral policy the minister had deviated from the position taken in England, Scotland and Wales.He said the decision was made against the secretary of state's recommendation that the report from the advisory committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) should be followed.The judge held that the additional risk from deferring donation for 12 months, instead of permanently, was very minimal.He said: "The minister has decided that MSM (males who have sex with other males) behaviour creates such a high risk of infection to the donor that such donors must be permanently deferred with the result that such blood cannot enter the Northern Ireland blood stock."Importing blood from other places which do accept MSM donors, even in limited quantities, leaves the door open for MSM blood to do just that."There is clearly a defect in reason here."Applying different standards to imported blood defeats the whole purpose of a permanent deferral, he added.Declaring the decision irrational, he said: "If there is a genuine concern about the safety of MSM donated blood such that the blood stock must be protected absolutely from such blood then the security of that blood must actually be maintained absolutely."Dealing with the alleged breach of the ministerial code, the judge said the lifetime ban was both controversial and cross-cutting, taking in equality issues."As such the minister had no authority to act without bringing them to the attention of the Executive Committee which he failed to do."In doing so the minister breached the ministerial code and... had no legal authority to take a decision in breach of the ministerial code."</body>

      <title>MSPs raise financial powers concern</title>
      <description>New financial powers already agreed for Scotland will be a "considerable challenge" to implement, a Holyrood committee warns.</description>

      <date>1381472847</date>
      <body>New financial powers already agreed for Scotland will be a "considerable challenge" to implement, a Holyrood committee has warned.MSPs are concerned about the level of information provided by the UK and Scottish governments to help with the provisions of the Scotland Act 2012.This includes a new rate of income tax due to come into force in April 2016.The Scottish government agreed that more clarity was needed and said it was working on this with the Treasury.The new tax rate will involve the Treasury deducting 10p from standard and upper rates of income tax in Scotland and giving MSPs the power to decide how to raise money.But Holyrood's Finance Committee said there was a lack of clarity about forecasts, particularly with the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).It found that considerable work would be needed by both governments to agree proposals to adjust the block grant allocated to Scotland by Westminster.MSPs also have concerns about "wildly optimistic" OBR forecasts for the land and building transaction tax (LBTT), which replaces stamp duty land tax in April 2015.They said forecasting for a new landfill tax must be transparent and open.Finance committee convener Kenneth Gibson MSP said: "We believe it is essential that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation process and, in particular, the way in which the UK government will adjust Scotland's block grant to take account of the new financial powers."We will continue to closely monitor the accuracy of the OBR forecasts and will take evidence from the chair of the OBR on an annual basis."The report concluded: "The committee recognises that there is a considerable challenge for both the UK government and the Scottish government in implementing the financial provisions of the Scotland Act 2012."Nevertheless, it is essential that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation process."The report added: "The committee is concerned about the level of information being provided by the two governments as the negotiations progress."At the same time, the committee welcomes the commitment of the Scottish government to consult with the Scottish Parliament on the adjustments to the block grant and emphasises the need for sufficient time to be made available to allow the committee to carry out effective scrutiny of the proposal."A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "We welcome this report and the recognition of the Scottish government's work to take forward the financial provisions of the Scotland Act."We agree that the Scottish Parliament and people require greater clarity over changes to the allocation of the block grant and the Scottish government is working actively with HM Treasury to achieve that."While welcome, the tax raising powers to be transferred to the Scottish Parliament through the Scotland Act represent a missed opportunity, only giving Parliament control over an additional 17% of Scotland's revenues."With full fiscal and economic powers the Scottish Parliament could do more to realise Scotland's full economic potential."</body>

      <title>English or Welsh driving test rule</title>
      <description>All driving test candidates to take written theory exam in either English or Welsh after UK government announces a ban on foreign languages.</description>

      <date>1381472358</date>
      <body>All driving test candidates will have to sit the written theory exam in either English or Welsh after a ban on foreign languages by the UK government.The change follows the case of a woman who was jailed at Cardiff Crown Court after she gave dozens of candidates the answers in Mandarin.Driving licences were stripped from 94 people after Allyson Ng sold answers to the written test.Ng, from Bristol, was jailed for a year in August for fraud.Cardiff Crown Court heard she told candidates when to say "yes" on multiple choice questions in the theory section of the driving test.Since 2009 she had interpreted on 123 theory tests and while the majority of the fraudulent tests were in Cardiff, a small number were in Birmingham.Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he wanted all drivers to have the skills to use roads safely and it would also help reduce the risk of fraud by interpreters.At present, candidates who do not speak English or Welsh can ask for pre-recorded voiceovers for theory tests in 19 foreign languages or use interpreters for both parts of the exam.But from April the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) will scrap foreign language help. It said that was backed by most of the 2,000 people who replied to its consultation.Many also said foreign language speakers may not understand road signs or be able to speak to traffic officers.Ng admitted to conspiring to defraud the DSA, the arm of the Department of Transport in charge of driving tests.She was arrested at the Cardiff theory test centre in October 2012.Ng charged £110 a time for translation and the agency said it became suspicious after a surge in her customer numbers in the second half of 2011.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>
      <date>1358939858</date>
      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <date>1381232529</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons.Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws.

      <title>No driving licence until 19?</title>
      <description>Could drivers be denied a full licence until the age of 19?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24481574</url>
      <date>1381430020</date>
      <body>Teenagers, get ready to be outraged.Some new research put together for the government suggests that young drivers shouldn't be able to qualify for a full licence until they are 19 years old.In effect, it's proposing that 17 year olds have to spend at least a year learning how to drive before taking their test. After they pass they'll then have to spend another year on "probation", with some chunky restrictions on what they can do.For example, no driving between 22:00 and 05:00 unless you have someone over 30 years old in the car. Why? Because 30-year-olds are more sensible.It stops people filling their Vauxhall Viva with boisterous teenagers. You'll have to drive around with a green "P" plate on the car.Can you imagine police patrols trying to work out at a glance whether someone's 30 years old or not?It also suggests a ban on carrying passengers under 30 years old for all novice drivers aged under 30.Controversial stuff. Having said all that, though, there is plenty in this work by the Transport Research Laboratory that that I'm sure will be welcomed by most campaigners - and parents, frankly.Things like:- road skills being taught in schools as part of the national curriculum- letting learner drivers practise on the motorway- making learners drive for a minimum of 100 supervised hours during the day and 20 at night. They'd have to fill in a log book to show they'd done it, although I suppose that's not hard to fake, is it?Anyway, why does all this matter? Three reasons.1. Driving is one of the biggest killers of young people in Britain. They're involved in around 20% of the worst accidents yet only drive around 5% of all miles. (I had a nasty accident three days after I passed my test because I was driving like a fool).2. Some of these suggestions could happen. The government's going to consult on all this stuff soon and there could be a new law in a year or two.3. If you cut accidents amongst young people, firstly you save tragedy and heartache for thousands of families; secondly insurance premiums might even come down. So more young people can get mobile.The AA has already waded in. Its president, Edmund King, says: "There are many proposals in the report with merit and which are advocated by the AA. Road safety on the national curriculum is something we have long campaigned for and I am pleased to see it being recommended here."Likewise we would also support learner drivers being allowed on motorways with their instructor. However, at the extreme end this report could be seen as just recommending taking novice drivers off the road by regulation and restriction rather than helping them develop the right attitudes and skills to provide them with the mobility they need".The government's publishing its young drivers Green Paper this month (hopefully). Expect plenty of interesting suggestions and ideas in that.Are you a teenager? What do you think? @richardwestcott</body>

      <description>At-a-glance guide to a century of British immigration acts</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24463873</url>
      <date>1381365531</date>
      <body>The government has published its Immigration Bill, which will change the rules on access to the NHS and impose tougher penalties for illegal working. But what legislation has been passed over the last century or so?This targeted "undesirable aliens" - such as paupers, lunatics, vagrants and prostitutes - who could be refused entry.This granted the common status of British subject upon those persons who had specified connections with the Crown's dominions.The Empire's dominions each adopted their separate citizenships, but retained the common status of British subject.This required certain potential migrants to supply proof that either they, their parents or grandparents had been born in Britain.Commonwealth citizens lost their automatic right to remain in the UK, meaning they faced the same restrictions as those from elsewhere. They would in future only be allowed to remain in UK after they had lived and worked here for five years.A partial "right of abode" was introduced, lifting all restrictions on immigrants with a direct personal or ancestral connection with Britain.This act ensured that only one wife or widow of a polygamous marriage had a right to enter the country.It also ensured people with freedom of movement in the European Community did not need leave to enter or remain in the UK.It became a criminal offence to employ anyone unless they had permission to live and work in the UK.The act removed benefits from asylum seekers and created the National Asylum Service to house them, taking pressure off local authorities.This created the first English test and citizenship exam for immigrants and introduced measures against bogus marriages.This act introduced a single form of appeal that remains to this day and made it a criminal offence to destroy travel documents. It limited access to support for those told to leave the UK.A five-tier points system for awarding entry visas was created.Those refused work or study visas had their rights of appeal limited.The act brought in on-the-spot fines of £2,000, payable by employers for each illegal employee, which could include parents taking on nannies without visas.This provided the UK Border Agency with powers to tackle illegal working and automatically deport some foreign nationals imprisoned for specific offences, or for more than one year.It gave immigration officers police-like powers, such as increased detention and a search-and-entry roles.The act brought in the power to create compulsory biometric cards for non-EU immigrants.This act amended the rules so people from outside the European Economic Area had to have residential status for eight years before being eligible for naturalisation.Those seeking naturalisation through wedlock had to be married for five years first.The act also allowed immigration and customs officers to perform some of each other's roles and imposed a duty on home secretaries to safeguard children.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Help to Buy mortgage scheme</title>
      <description>How will the new mortgage scheme work?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24447335</url>
      <date>1381239589</date>
      <body>The government says that its Help to Buy scheme will assist people trying to get on the housing ladder who can afford mortgage repayments but are struggling to raise a deposit.But critics say that the government guarantee, that forms part of the second phase of the scheme, could create a housing bubble in the UK.Not all mortgage seekers will be able to sign up, and those who do will still have to go through "rigorous" affordability checks by their lender.Haven't I heard about this for a while?Yes, in fact some parts of the scheme have been operating for a few months.The first phase started in April in England. This sees the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of newly-built properties. These buyers must offer a 5% deposit.Similar schemes operate in Wales and Scotland - all of which are aimed at encouraging housebuilding.But that's not all, is it?No, the second phase of the scheme, originally planned for January 2014, has been brought forward so mortgage products are available from now.Under this system, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The lender offers a mortgage covering the other 95%.Lenders can sign up to the Help to Buy scheme and pay a fee to the government, which will provide a seven-year taxpayer guarantee covering 15% of the loan value. That guarantee can be called in if the borrower defaults.It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. The scheme is expected to continue for three years.Are the lenders keen?There has been a mixed response so far.RBS and Lloyds Banking Group - both of which are taxpayer backed - are participating in the second phase of Help to Buy.Smaller lenders Virgin Money and Aldermore have announced that they will be involved as well, from January.However, among the lenders still deciding whether to sign up are Barclays, Santander and Nationwide Building Society.How much do these mortgages cost?A few lenders have started to reveal the pricing of these 95% mortgages.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.That is relatively competitive compared with prices outside of Help to Buy, although borrowers are likely to get a better deal if they save up longer for a deposit. These 95% mortgages have all but disappeared from the market since the start of the financial crisis.Is there a chance of a return of irresponsible lending?The government says that various rules have been included to ensure this does not happen.For example, no interest-only or offset mortgages will be allowed. The system cannot be used for the purchase of second homes or for mortgages for buy-to-let investors.In addition, lenders must put these borrowers through new affordability checks. These were brought in for everyone to avoid a return of the reckless lending of the last boom.You mention boom, isn't this just going to create another one?That's the fear from many commentators who say that Help to Buy is simply going to help some relatively well-off people move up the housing ladder.Critics, including Labour, say that this does nothing to tackle the shortage of affordable homes to buy, so it wants more focus on housebuilding.Treasury officials suggest that the system will correct a failure in the market and stimulate builders to get going again with bricks and mortar.</body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24438875</url>
      <date>1381180644</date>
      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <title>Apple 'should buy big companies'</title>
      <description>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley tells the BBC.</description>

      <date>1381492761</date>
      <body>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley has said.He said it could shift the "whole landscape of e-commerce" if it bought, for example, eBay.He said it should ignore the wishes of activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants the company to buy back stock."Apple's about building great products, building and shaping markets," Mr Sculley said."Carl Icahn has suggested to [Apple chief executive] Tim Cook, 'Why don't you buy more stock back or make a bigger dividend?'"I'd rather see Apple continue to invest in building... even make big acquisitions that were strategic, as opposed to buying more stock back, or giving more dividends."Mr Sculley was the chief executive of Apple between 1983 and 1993.During his tenure, he famously engineered the "forcing out" of Steve Jobs from the company - a decision he later said was due to his own inexperience in appreciating Mr Jobs' vision for future products.Traditionally, Apple has not acquired large scale companies - instead buying smaller companies with specific technologies, and folding them into the business.One recent example of this is Siri, a company Apple acquired in 2010 when it wanted to provide an integrated personal assistant on its iPhone and iPad products.Mr Sculley said that while he had "no insider knowledge" of the firm he left in 1993, he said he now wonders if it is time for Apple to change its growth strategy."Apple's never been an acquirer of big companies before, and when you look at the [Apple digital ticket system] Passbook, and fingerprint recognition - what would it mean if Apple went out and bought eBay? And they had PayPal, and integrated that?"My guess is you'd suddenly see the whole landscape of e-commerce shift."You have Amazon, which is on the fast-track to dominate every aspect of e-commerce - suddenly the game, the landscape, would change."Mr Sculley was in London ahead of the UK launch of the latest product he is working on - the Misfit Shine, a wearable device that monitors various aspects of a person's health."The future of wearable products has the potential to have a huge impact on healthcare," he said.He also, at the age of 74, offers his services as a mentor to up and coming Silicon Valley chief executives - something he said he wished he had while at Apple."When you're dealing in industries where there's such a thin line between success and failure, having another set of trusted eyes can be a real nice advantage."Mr Sculley also offered warm words for the soon-to-be-departing Microsoft boss, Steve Ballmer."Here's a man who has spent 33 years at Microsoft, loves the company," he said. "He really did not get enough credit for what he did accomplish."I can't name a CEO who didn't make some mistakes in the hi-tech industry."I think Ballmer has a lot he ought to be proud of. So he didn't get everything right - not many people do."He added: "I think it's important the CEOs do move on."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <body>The "dark web" services used by criminals will continue to evolve in an attempt to evade authorities, the UK's cybercrime boss has warned.Last week, notorious drugs market place the Silk Road was shut down after a lengthy investigation.Andy Archibald, interim head of the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), said officers identified individuals who were using the site.But he said new methods were needed to keep up with the threat."[Online anonymity service] Tor evolves, and will resecure itself," Mr Archibald told the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones."The success we've had may not necessarily mean that by the same routes and same approaches we can get into other criminal forums."We have to continually probe and identify those forums and then seek to infiltrate them and use other tools."It's not simply a case of because we were able to infiltrate Tor on this occasion that we'll be able to do it next time around as well."Mr Archibald's comments came as the NCCU announced its first conviction. Twenty-seven-year-old Olukunle Babatunde received a five years and six month prison sentence.The man, from Croydon, south London, pleaded guilty to using "phishing" scams in an attempt to defraud banks, financial institutions and their customers.</body>

      <title>Ultrasound offers gesture control</title>
      <description>Ultrasound technology to enable mobiles and tablets to be controlled by gesture has been developed.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24474342</url>
      <date>1381418869</date>
      <body>Ultrasound technology that enables mobiles and tablets to be controlled by gesture could go into production as early as next year.Norwegian start-up Elliptic Labs is in talks with Asian handset manufacturers to get the chip embedded in devices.The technology works via an ultrasound chip that uses sound waves to interpret hand movements.The move towards gesture control has gathered pace and there are now many such products on the market.What sets Elliptic's gesture-control system apart from others is its wide field of use, up to a metre away from the phone. It means it can identify mid-air gestures accurately.Because it uses sound rather than sight, the sensor can recognise gestures from a 180-degree field. It also consumes less power and works in the dark.By contrast Samsung's Galaxy S4 uses an infrared sensor that can only interpret hand movements within a very small zone."The user needs to learn the exact spot to gesture to instead of having a large interactive space around the device," said Erik Forsstrom, the user interface designer for Elliptic Labs.Allowing users more freedom in how they gesture is vital if such products are to become mainstream, he thinks."With a small screen such as a phone or a tablet, the normal body language is not that precise. You need a large zone in which to gesture."If consumers can quickly see the effects their gestures have on screen, he thinks, "it is quite likely that this is the next step within mobile".The technology was recently shown off at Japanese tech show Ceatec.In the demonstration, an Android smartphone was housed in a case containing the ultrasound transmitters.But Elliptic Labs said it had formed partnerships with a number of Asian handset manufacturers who are looking at building the ultrasound chip into devices, as early as next year.Increasingly firms are experimenting with gesture control.PrimeSense, the company that developed gesture control for Microsoft's Kinect console, has also made strides towards bringing the technology to mobile.By shrinking down the sensor used in the Kinect, the firm showed it working with a Nexus 10 at a Google developers' conference in May.Meanwhile Disney is testing technology that allows users to "feel" the texture of objects on a flat touchscreen.The technique involves sending tiny vibrations through the display that let people "feel" the shallow bumps, ridges and edges of an object.Ben Wood, analyst with research firm CCS Insight thinks such devices could be ready for the mass market."Apple's success has made gestures a part of everyday life. Now consumers understand they can manipulate a screen with a gesture or a swipe everyone is racing to find innovative ways to exploit this behaviour."Ultrasonic is particularly interesting as you don't need to touch the screen which can be an almost magical experience."It is ideal if you have dirty or sweaty hands. A common example people use is flicking through a recipe when cooking. Other examples include transitioning through a slideshow of photos or flicking through music tracks or turning the page on an ebook," he said."The big challenge that remains is how you make users aware of the capability."See more tech from the Ceatec show on Click this weekend</body>

      <body>Foxconn, the world's biggest contract electronics maker, has admitted student interns worked shifts at a factory in China that were in violation of its company policies.The firm, which makes products for some the world's biggest brands, has been under scrutiny for labour practices.It had admitted to hiring underage interns at the same unit last year.Foxconn said actions had been taken to bring the factory "into full compliance with our code and policies"."There have been a few instances where our policies pertaining to overtime and night shift work were not enforced," the company said in a statement.The manufacturing giant is owned by Taiwanese group Hon Hai Precision and employs about 800,000 workers around the globe.Foxconn, while not a household name in itself for many consumers, is used by most of the big technology giants around the world, including Apple, Sony, Microsoft, HP, and Nokia.It first came under scrutiny for its labour practices when 13 employees committed suicide at its Chinese plants in 2010.The incidents raised concerns over working conditions at its units in China and drew attention to growing labour strikes.For its part, Foxconn responded by raising wages, shortening working hours and employing counsellors on site.It also installed suicide nets to factory living-quarters at its Shenzhen factory.Also in 2010, Foxconn temporarily shut down a unit in India after 250 workers fell sick.And in May 2011, two people were killed after an explosion at a company plant in Chengdu.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <title>Ofcom price hike alarms mobile firms</title>
      <description>Mobile networks left "disappointed" as Ofcom proposes quadrupled licence fees, leading to concerns the cost may be passed on to consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24475802</url>
      <date>1381406086</date>
      <body>Mobile network operators may have to pay more than four times the current amount to use the radio spectrum, under new proposals from Ofcom.The regulator said the new licensing fees reflected market value based on other European countries.Operators told the BBC the increase was "excessive". Vodafone said it was "disappointed".Some analysts have raised concerns the increased costs might be passed on to the public."The size of these figures may come as bad news to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers," said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com."The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum - our concern is that it will be consumers who are left to foot the bill."However, the good news for concerned consumers is that no increases have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases."An Ofcom spokesman told the BBC that while it had no control over how much operators charged customers, it did not expect the rise to have an impact on bills.In an advisory note, financial services firm JP Morgan said it expected the competitiveness of the mobile market would stop costs being passed down.However, operators contacted by the BBC expressed concern that the rise had been higher than they had budgeted for.The affected companies - Vodafone, O2, EE and Three - each told the BBC that they would respond to Ofcom's announcement in due course.EE said it would aim to stress that "there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy".Vodafone criticised Ofcom, saying: "We are disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430% increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure."The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come."Prices for the 900Mhz and 1800Mhz spectrum bands were set when it was used for 2G services several years ago. Ofcom has since "liberated" the spectrum - the term given when a certain band is freed up for different purposes.In this case, it meant that operators could use the bands for higher-speed services such as 4G.In 2010, the government instructed Ofcom to revisit the cost of the licences for 900Mhz and 1800Mhz which - in comparison with other equivalent services across the EU - were considered to be very cheap.The new prices will see Vodafone and O2's individual fees rise from £15.6m to £83.1m. EE will pay £107.1m, up from £24.9m, and Three will go from £8.3m to £35.7m.The increase comes at a time when operators are facing a drop in income via calls made while customers are overseas. The European Union is pressing hard for far lower roaming costs in a bid to reduce so-called "bill shock".A source at one of the affected operators said he expected operators would now engage in a tug of war with Ofcom to see the proposed amounts lowered.In response, the regulator said: "It's a consultation - we welcome the views of our stakeholders. Nothing's final at this stage."They've been expecting this for some time and we've based our proposed annual license fees on market value."Ofcom also dismissed the suggestion that the price hike is in response to a lower-than-expected return from the recent auction of 4G spectrum, which took place earlier in the year.That sale raised £2.3bn - less than the £3.5bn expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.The shortfall is being investigated by the National Audit Office, which expects to publish its findings early next year.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <title>Ford car wrests control of steering</title>
      <description>Ford is testing a car that takes control of the steering wheel away from the driver if it believes they are failing to take the action necessary to avoid a crash.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24464480</url>
      <date>1381330900</date>
      <body>A car that takes control of the steering wheel when it detects the risk of a collision is being tested at a research facility in Germany.Ford said the Obstacle Avoidance system first warned the driver of danger and then took charge if they did not react.The firm said the equipment had been fitted to one of its vehicles as part of a project involving other carmakers and suppliers.One analyst said it was a staging post on the route to "driverless cars".The system scans up to 200m (650ft) ahead by using three radars, a number of ultrasonic sensors and a camera, which are all installed in the vehicle.An additional built-in display shows a warning sign and sounds a chime. Then, if necessary, it applies the brakes, scans for a gap in the road ahead, and steers to avoid a crash."You're driving down the road and a pedestrian or something comes out from either side of your vehicle from your peripheral vision where you don't have a good look at it," said Barb Samardzich, vice-president of product development at Ford's European division."Obstacle Avoidance can sense that the pedestrian or that object is coming across the front of your vehicle. If it doesn't sense you responding accordingly in your vehicle by braking or manoeuvring, it will take over."The firm showed off the tech at a facility in Lommel, Belgium, earlier this week.The new technology builds on safety features already offered by Ford.Last year it introduced Lane Keeping Alert, a feature that vibrates the wheel - but does not take control - if it detects the driver is drifting out of a lane without using an indicator.Ford's existing Active City Stop facility also aims to reduce the severity of collisions by applying the brakes if it detects an object in front of the vehicle. But it works only if the object is static or travelling less than 30km/h (19mph) faster than the car.By contrast, the company said the new tech was being tested at speeds of over 60 km/h (38mph).Other manufacturers involved in the project at Aachen include BMW, Fiat, Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen. They will share data from the tests to develop systems of their own.Volvo - which is owned by China's Geely - has already introduced its own pedestrian and cyclist alert system, which sounds an alarm and applies the brakes. The firm told the BBC in March that it was now adapting the system so it would soon be able to recognise animals.There may be resistance from some to the idea of a car taking control from its driver.But Ford points out that fewer than one-third of all drivers involved in rear-end collisions had attempted to steer clear of the accident, according to data collected by Germany's Federal Statistical Office.With that in mind, one independent analyst said it should not be too hard for manufacturers to convince motorists of the innovation's benefit."The logic behind the technology is impeccable - anything that can avoid a potentially dangerous situation that can cause injury or death sounds like a good piece of equipment," said Tim Urquhart, senior analyst at consultants IHS Automotive."Obviously it will come at a price. But there will be less resistance to a piece of technology like this than there will be to the concept of totally driverless cars."But autonomous vehicles are already being tested by Google, Daimler and others, and taking steering control in an emergency situation is obviously a pretty significant step along the road."Ford said more tests were needed and it was not yet ready to announce a launch date for its Obstacle Avoidance system.</body>

      <body>Russian police have reportedly arrested a man on suspicion of masterminding two infamous hacking tools.He is suspected of being the man behind the alias Paunch - the nickname used by the creator of the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits, sold to cybercriminals to infect web users with malware.The Russian authorities have not confirmed the details.But security firms said they had already detected a decline in the programs' use.A spokesman for the law enforcement agency Europol told the BBC: "Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre has been informed that a high-level suspected cyber criminal has been arrested."We can only refer you to the Russian authorities, they are the ones who should speak about this topic."The Russian police's press office said it had nothing to add at this time.However, Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at the Moscow-based internet protection provider Kaspersky Lab, said the arrest had been confirmed to him by "anonymous sources".The Blackhole kit, released in 2010, dominated the crimeware market throughout 2012 and the start of 2013, according to Fraser Howard, a researcher at the anti-virus company Sophos.He said the code had been sold for an annual licence of $1,500 (£940) or could be rented from its creator for $200 (£125) for one week's use, among other price plans.The software targeted a range of vulnerabilities in the Java programming language, Adobe's Flash media player, Windows software and PDF files.It had two ways of doing this:Among the malware downloaded was:Although Mr Howard said Blackhole was once the biggest threat of its kind, he added that in recent months it had been overshadowed by rival kits, including Sweet Orange and Neutrino.According to the researcher, the Blackhole and Cool kits put together were only involved in about 4% of all malware detected by Sophos in August, down from 28% the previous year.The figure had since dropped to 2% in recent days, he added.Another independent security blogger stressed that the arrest was still significant."If it's true that the brains behind the Blackhole has been apprehended it's a very big deal - a real coup for the cybercrime-fighting authorities, and hopefully cause disruption to the development of one of the most notorious exploit kits the web has ever seen," said Graham Cluley."However, it's worth remembering that nature abhors a vacuum, and there would surely be other online criminals waiting to take their place, promoting their alternative exploit kits and malicious code."Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, agreed."If indeed it is Paunch that they arrested, that is a major arrest - he is a big deal," he told the BBC."He was clearly the biggest player in providing exploit kits - not just by selling them, but also renting and leasing them to online criminals."Both Blackhole and its successor Cool have been very popular."Users didn't have to be very technical to operate them - there was a manual that came with them - they just had to get them running and be able to break into a high-profile website, or create a new one from scratch, to install something bad on your computer."</body>

      <body>Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) have hit a five-year low, according to new figures from the research firm Gartner.Shipments totalled 80.3m units in the three months to September, down 8.6% from a year ago.PC sales have now fallen for six quarters in a row, hurt by the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones.Gartner said falling prices of tablets had further hurt sales of PCs in emerging markets."Consumers' shift from PCs to tablets for daily content consumption continued to decrease the installed base of PCs both in mature as well as in emerging markets," Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement."A greater availability of inexpensive Android tablets attracted first-time consumers in emerging markets, and as supplementary devices in mature markets."Research firm IDC, also released figures on Thursday, which showed global shipments of PCs fell by 7.6% to 81.6m units over the period.Gartner and IDC use slightly different methods to calculate PC shipment data.IDC said it was likely the ongoing decline in PC sales would continue into next year."Whether constrained by a weak economy or being selective in their tech investments, buyers continue to evaluate options and delay PC replacements," Loren Loverde, vice president of IDC's Worldwide PC Trackers, said in a statement.In July this year, IDC had said it was still looking for some improvement in growth during the second half of the year. It has now reversed that view."The third quarter was pretty close to forecast, which unfortunately doesn't reflect much improvement in the PC market, or potential for near-term growth," said Mr Loverde.</body>

      <date>1381319804</date>
      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <title>Guardian plans more Snowden leaks</title>
      <description>The Guardian's editor says he plans to publish more revelations from Edward Snowden despite MI5 warning that such disclosures cause "enormous damage".</description>

      <date>1381334515</date>
      <body>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger says he plans to publish more revelations from Edward Snowden despite MI5 warning that such disclosures cause enormous damage.Mr Rusbridger insisted the paper was right to publish files leaked by the US intelligence analyst and had helped to prompt a necessary and overdue debate.His comments come after criticism from the new head of MI5, Andrew Parker.Making public the "reach and limits" of intelligence-gathering techniques gave terrorists the advantage, he said.Mr Snowden, a former CIA contractor, fled to Russia with a wealth of secret data including some 58,000 files from GCHQ, Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency.The stories that followed in the Guardian newspaper, based on material provided by Mr Snowden, revealed the huge capacity of British and US intelligence agencies - GCHQ and NSA - to monitor communications.Mr Rusbridger said more stories would be published in the future as the leaked documents were "slowly and responsibly" worked through.In his first public speech since his appointment to director general in April, Mr Parker said intelligence gathered by GCHQ had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade.Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques".He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps".Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 to retain the capability to access such information if it was to protect the country.Mr Rusbridger said those on the security side of the argument wanted to keep everything secret and did not want a debate."You don't want the press or anyone else writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in the debate," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.He added that his newspaper had revealed the "extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance"."I just spent a week in America where everybody is talking about this, from the president down."He added: "It's quite surprising to me that the number of MPs in this country who have said anything at all in the last four months can be counted on one hand - Malcolm Rifkind, Tom Watson, David Davis."So, if Parliament's not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only do this in private then I think absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion, which as I say, throughout America, throughout Europe, is one that the public are intensely interested in."Asked about Mr Parker's suggestion that publishing the documents was helping terrorists, Mr Rusbridger said: "They will always say that. You read histories of intelligence and you go back to the 1990s and the security people were saying the same."The independent MP Patrick Mercer said intelligence data should not be published if it compromised public security."If in any way our security is compromised by revealing too much, that's a mistake. Just imagine if we had revealed the whole Enigma secret during the Second World War."That might have been in the public's interest - but we'd have lost the war."</body>

      <title>Panasonic 'to quit' plasma TV sector</title>
      <description>Panasonic, the Japanese electronics company, may stop production of loss-making plasma TV screens in 2014, according to reports.</description>

      <body>Panasonic, the Japanese electronics company, is to stop production of plasma TV screens in 2014, according to reports.The company will close its plasma screen factory in Amagasaki and put it up for sale next year, Nikkei business daily and Reuters have said.Panasonic's plasma TV division made huge losses in recent years.But a Panasonic spokesman told the BBC: "Nothing has been decided at this stage."Other electronics companies, such as Hitachi and Pioneer, have already pulled out of the sector.In its last financial year, Panasonic as a whole made a loss of 754bn yen (£4.85bn), following a 772bn yen loss the previous year.This is despite the fact that its plasma TVs are critically acclaimed, with the European Imaging Sound Association voting Panasonic's Viera TX-P60ZT65 European home cinema TV of the year 2013-2014.Plasma screens, which use electrically charged ionised gases, are praised for their brightness, deep blacks, and rich colour displays, but tend to use more electricity than other screen technologies."In the last two or three years plasma TVs have lost most of the advantages they had to LCD [liquid crystal display] TVs," said Tom Morrod, senior director of consumer electronics at research company IHS."We're forecasting that they will be gone completely by 2018."Panasonic president Kazuhiro Tsuga's is focused on jettisoning underperforming divisions and concentrating on higher-margin products in a bid to return the group to profitability.Panasonic, along with its domestic rivals Sharp and Sony, have all struggled to cope with falling electronics prices and stiff competition from South Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers.Meanwhile, new screen technologies, such as LCD, organic light emitting diode (OLED), and the most recent ultra-high-definition 4K standard, may have hastened plasma's demise.</body>

      <body>A beta version of the BBC Playlister, a new digital service that allows listeners to tag any piece of music they hear on the BBC and listen to it later, has gone live.BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe claimed the project puts the BBC "at the heart of what is happening now"."The whole essence of radio is to communicate: To be able to say 'I love this song'."Now we can really listen to what [the audience] is into and what they love."The aim of Playlister is to give audiences an easy way to find out what music is being played on BBC Radio networks (and, later, on BBC TV shows) and to listen to it again.From Wednesday, every song played on BBC radio will be made listed on the relevant programme website.Anyone with a BBC account can click an "add this" button to add tracks to a personal playlist, and export them to a outside streaming service, such as YouTube, Deezer and Spotify, where they can be played back in full.The homepage of the Playlister website also lists the BBC's most recently-played songs, as well as the most popular or most searched-for music.Mark Friend, BBC controller for multi-platform radio and music, said the service was "easy to use [and] accessible for everyone", adding that it would "join up your BBC experiences with the music experiences you have on the rest of the internet".The launch comes one year on from the launch of BBC iPlayer radio, which "brought together all of the music and the radio from the BBC into one online product... and transformed the BBC's role in digital music," he said.Following the initial Playlister launch on Wednesday, further developments will include the launch of the same functions within the iPlayer radio app, broadening the Playlister to include number of TV programmes - such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Voice - and the introduction of presenter playlists.The presenter playlist will allow BBC DJs and presenters "to be able to curate their own chosen music and present that to the audience" within the Playlister function."It's about enhancing people's music experience," explained Mark Foster, of Deezer, one of the BBC Playlister's commercial partners."A service like ours has 25 million tracks... being able to use trusted curators, like Zane, is all about building trust, building confidence and helping people navigate through this fantastic selection of music that we have.""The ability to discover music and follow people whose musical taste has really shaped yours is going to add a really level of texture to our services," echoed Chris Maples, of fellow commercial partner Spotify.Playlister "will influence the way we make radio," said Lowe, adding, "the traffic goes both ways; communication between presenters and the audience becomes very direct."Playlister gives the BBC a chance to do that globally, which is a big part of what the BBC's future.""People want to keep up-to-date," added Maples. "What's really cool about this is that I can take the perceived cool of Zane and add it to my playlist."Statistics suggest that last year, more than 26 million people listened to music on the BBC radio network every single week and nearly 50 million watched some music from the BBC."Audiences want an easy way to find out and remember the music they hear on our programmes and to get good music recommendations," said Mr Friend"Playlister presents a huge creative opportunity, not just to the audience, but also to us the programme-makers."</body>

      <title>Disney tests 'tactile' touchscreen</title>
      <description>Disney researchers have found a way for people to feel the texture of the objects they see on a 2D touchscreen.</description>

      <date>1381231821</date>
      <body>Disney researchers have found a way for people to "feel" the texture of objects seen on a flat touchscreen.The technique involves sending tiny vibrations through the display that let people "feel" the shallow bumps, ridges and edges of an object.The vibrations fooled fingers into believing they were touching a textured surface, said the Disney researchers.The vibration-generating algorithm should be easy to add to existing touchscreen systems, they added.Developed by Dr Ali Israr and colleagues at Disney's research lab in Pittsburgh, the vibrational technique re-creates what happens when a finger tip passes over a real bump."Our brain perceives the 3D bump on a surface mostly from information that it receives via skin stretching," said Ivan Poupyrev, head of the interaction research group in Pittsburgh.To fool the brain into thinking it is touching a real feature, the vibrations imparted via the screen artificially stretch the skin on a fingertip so a bump is felt even though the touchscreen surface is smooth.The researchers have developed an underlying algorithm that can be used to generate textures found on a wide variety of objects.A video depicting the system in action shows people feeling apples, jellyfish, pineapples, a fossilised trilobite as well as the hills and valleys on a map.The more pronounced the feature, the greater the vibration is needed to mimic its feel.The vibration system should be more flexible than existing systems used to give tactile feedback on touchscreens, which typically used a library of canned effects, said Dr Israr."With our algorithm we do not have one or two effects, but a set of controls that make it possible to tune tactile effects to a specific visual artefact on the fly," he added.</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>Four arrested over Silk Road links</title>
      <description>Four men arrested in UK over links to illegal online marketplace Silk Road.</description>

      <body>Four men have been arrested in the UK over their role in illegal online marketplace Silk Road.Three men in their early 20s were arrested in Manchester while a fourth man, in his 50s, was detained in Devon.The men were initially arrested on suspicion of drug offences. More arrests are expected in the coming weeks.Such sites would be a "key priority" for the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), its director general said.The Silk Road, one of the world's largest websites selling illegal drugs, has now been closed down.Ross Ulbricht, the alleged operator of the site was arrested in San Francisco by the FBI at the beginning of October.Last week 40-year-old Steven Lloyd Sadler was arrested in Seattle. He is alleged to be one of the most prolific sellers on the Silk Road.The site operated on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations. Such areas of the internet are not covered by standard search engines.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.Keith Bristow, the NCA's director general, warned that users who think they can hide their identity on the internet need to think again."These arrests send a clear message to criminals; the hidden internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.""It is impossible for criminals to completely erase their digital footprint. No matter how technology-savvy the offender, they will always make mistakes."Exeter-based officers worked closely with American law enforcement officers to identify significant UK users of the Silk Road.It is hoped that the investigation will give them insights into how criminals use the dark net."These criminal areas of the internet aren't just selling drugs; it's where fraud takes place, where the trafficking of people and goods is discussed, where child abuse images are exchanged and firearms are traded," said Andy Archibald, head of the NCA's national cybercrime unit.The Silk Road may now be defunct but it seems that users are planning to resurrect the service.Technology news site TechCrunch reports that Silk Road version 2 could be "ready to launch".</body>

      <title>Nokia gives deadline for Symbian apps</title>
      <description>Nokia will no longer publish any content for Symbian on its app store from the end of the year.</description>

      <body>Nokia has sounded a further death knell for the operating systems Symbian and MeeGo, announcing no new content will be published on its app store from 1 January 2014.The company told developers they had just three months left to update content.The news has angered loyal fans still using the handsets.Nokia took the decision to make Windows Phone 7 its default operating system in 2011.The email outlining the timetable reads: "If you have Symbian and MeeGo content in the Nokia store, it will continue to be available for download to customers, and you will continue to receive download and revenue reports as well as payouts for downloaded content."However, starting January 1, 2014, you will no longer to be able to publish any new content or update existing content for Symbian and MeeGo."Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile phone business for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) last month.The purchase is set to be completed in early 2014, when about 32,000 Nokia employees will transfer to Microsoft.While the news is unsurprising, some had thought the eco-system around the operating systems would continue for a few more years. Technology firm Accenture is contracted to provide support to Nokia for its remaining Symbian handset until 2016.Customers and developers took to Twitter and other online platforms to express their anger about the swiftness of the close-down.</body>

      <title>Blu-Ray albums target hi-fi fans</title>
      <description>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.</description>

      <date>1381241353</date>
      <body>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.Nirvana's Nevermind and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black will be among the first records to be released in the format, which comes to the UK this month.Listeners will need a Blu-Ray player and a stereo system to play the discs, which promise to deliver "the sound as it was intended by the artist".However, high-fidelity audio products have failed to catch on in the past.DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD (SACD), both of which launched in the early 2000s, delivered better quality sound than ordinary CDs but faltered in the marketplace.The new format, officially called Pure Audio, uses similar encoding techniques to those predecessors but, crucially, has the support of all the major record labels from the outset.Pioneered by Universal Music, it launched in France earlier this year, where the initial batch of 35 titles have already achieved sales of more than 500,000.One album, Mylene Farmer's Monkey Me, has sold 84,000 copies on Blu-Ray alone - which would be enough to ensure a top 10 placing in the UK charts.The BBC was given several tracks to audition, comparing them directly to the equivalent songs on CD and MP3 through a home stereo system.Stevie Wonder's I Wish opened up, with a rounder, fuller bass and the intricate hi-hat work sounding crisp and bright.Bob Marley's Is This Love sounded more spacious than the muddy MP3, with Marley's soulful vocals so clear he could almost have been in the room.The clarity wasn't always an advantage, however: Serge Gainsbourg's spittle-flecked come-ons in L'hotel Particulier sounded doubly creepy in full resolution.But despite the improvements, the question remains: Will fans accept the format?Although they are lower quality than a CD, the portability of MP3s and Apple's iTunes format proved more alluring to consumers than either SACD or DVD-Audio, which are no longer manufactured in any great number."It's all about timing," said Olivier Robert Murphy, global head of new business at Universal."When SACD launched it was supported by only part of the industry, and you had to buy a 1,000 euro (£842) player. Here, we have 33% of the population that already has a Blu-Ray player at home.""The magic of this format is that you buy a £60 player, you put the disc in, you play it through a basic stereo sound system - the sound is incredible."Warner Music and Sony have already released albums on Blu-Ray in France and Japan, while Universal plans to issue 200 albums in 14 countries "very quickly".At launch, the UK catalogue will contain albums such as The Velvet Underground and Nico's self-titled debut, Queen's A Night At The Opera and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?Classical releases include the Berlin Philharmonic's interpretation of Mahler's Symphony No.5 and Rolando Vilazon's collection of Verdi's works for the tenor.Murphy acknowledged the selection relied heavily on heritage acts."It's not necessarily a strategy," he told the BBC, "but what we realised is that initially we're talking to specialists, we're talking to a niche"."I'm talking about the guy who spent 40 grand on his hi-fi system. Let's face it, this guy is probably 35-plus, and likes heritage artists."However, Murphy said the long-term goal was to release new albums in the format, too."For me, it could represent a very nice percentage of physical sales," he said."When I see that we're selling more vinyl now than in 2002, I know there is an appetite for this kind of music."But, in an admission of modern listening habits, albums purchased in the Blu-Ray format will come with a free copy of the lower-quality digital version."Blu-Ray is a copy-protected format," said Murphy. "If someone has spent £15 on a product, he should have the right to put it on their iPod and listen to it when he's doing his fitness programme."Eventually, the Pure Audio files could be distributed digitally themselves - but with a four-minute song needing 1GB of storage space, Murphy said it would be "three to four years" before that was a reality.</body>

      <title>Jony Ive designs one-off camera</title>
      <description>Sir Jony Ive, Apple's design chief, unveils a one-off camera he has designed for Leica that will be sold at a charity auction.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24458783</url>
      <date>1381312111</date>
      <body>If you've ever wondered what an iCamera might look like, a Jony Ive-designed Leica might offer a few hints.Apple's feted design chief teamed up with industrial designer Marc Newson to create the device as a bespoke item for a charity auction.While some may want to see it go into wider production, the amount of work that went into it means that the price would be out of reach for most.It is expected to fetch between $500,000 (£312,000) and $750,000.The special edition Leica M camera features an anodised aluminium case with tens of thousands of individual perforations.The camera took 85 days and more than 735 hours to manufacture.During that time more than 550 models and 1,000 prototype parts were made and tested; 55 engineers worked on the process.As for the specifications under the bonnet, it is similar to the standard $7,000 Leica and features a 24-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor and comes with a 50mm f/2 aperture lens.The RED charity, founded by U2's Bono, will host the auction in New York on November 23. All proceeds will go to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.Other items to be auctioned include a grand piano picked by the two designers, gold Apple earbuds and a cosmonaut suit.</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24431952</url>
      <date>1381195653</date>
      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <body>Funsho Lawal beams as she strides towards the Jumia delivery van parked outside her house in Surulere, a Lagos neighbourhood.The delight on her face soon fades as she struggles to fit into the bright red high heels she had ordered."This was the last pair. They only had them in this size," she complains.Funsho's expression changes again as she scrolls through her smartphone to find another pair of shoes on the Jumia website."This is the best, the very best way to shop," she says."I don't have to go out to the shop because they deliver right here to my house."Ten miles of traffic-congested roads away, in a huge warehouse, dozens of shelves stand stacked with a wide variety of products - from electronics to kitchen utensils.This 90,000-sq-ft (8,360-sq-m) building is the headquarters of Jumia, a company started just over a year ago.Now it is one of Nigeria's largest online retailers, with 500 workers and 150 delivery vehicles nationwide.The company's Harvard-educated co-founder Raphael Afaedor is bullish about the current growth."Every one of Nigeria's 36 states has had a Jumia parcel delivered there, so we're moving gradually to reach every Nigerian with organised retail," Mr Afaedor says.Jumia faces strong competition from Konga and Dealdey - similar retail websites also experiencing rapid growth.This rivalry presents options for Nigerian shoppers looking for home-grown answers to Amazon - which as yet has no dedicated retail presence on the continent - or eBay.Folake Adeniji, another online shopper, says: "For a long time I had to rely on people going abroad to come back with clothes and household items."Even if I found the items in shops they were always overpriced, so these shopping websites are like a breath of fresh air."Other avenues have opened in Nigeria's internet space, with companies offering services in food and drink, real estate, travel and mobile money transfer, among others.Mark Essien, a software developer, runs Hotels.ng - a website offering listings and reviews for more than 4,500 hotels in Nigeria.It is difficult to find a current database of phone numbers for hotels around the country - many of which do not have websites.This presents an opportunity for companies such as Mr Essien's, which has 40 employees, including some who have to physically visit hotels around the country to get them listed.The five-month-old company is confident that demand for its services will grow.Mr Essien says: "A lot of people are sceptical about companies like ours, but at the same time there is a lot of demand."We have people using our services. We have not started customer marketing yet, but every week we have close to 1,000 bookings."Mr Essien credits much of this initial success to another company, Spark.ng, which provided funding and mentorship that allowed Hotels.ng to grow as aggressively as it has.Spark has a fund of $1m (£616,000) to offer local internet start-ups. It is led by, among others, Jason Njoku, an internet entrepreneur who runs several online platforms, including IrokoTV, the largest distributor of Nigerian films.Meanwhile, Jumia received investment from Rocket Internet, a German online incubator which has now replicated the site in Kenya.While the companies are not willing to divulge the financial details of these partnerships, some observers believe the current period is a healthy one in Nigeria's e-commerce industry.For many years, any mention of Nigeria and the internet was met with scepticism because of worries about cybercrime.This has made it hard for local companies to gain the trust of the public, both abroad and within the country, although they are making attempts to overcome this."There are definitely technological challenges in Nigeria that are not faced in other countries," Mr Essien says."Payment systems are very manual - cards don't work very well. A lot of our customers prefer paying by bank deposits."The logistics network is very poor across Nigeria but a lot of these problems also represent opportunities that people can solve and create big companies out of," he adds.Customers can pay for their goods on delivery, in cash or by card, eliminating the fear of online fraud."It is interesting the amount of investment these companies are spending on advertising on television and on billboards," says Loy Okezie, a technology news blogger."The retail sites are booming and we can now compare them to other sites in the rest of the continent and India."Mr Okezie adds that much of the activity picked up in 2012 and the online supermarkets are currently more popular because they cater to immediate needs.According to the Nigeria Communications Commission, in June 2013 the country had 48.1 million active internet subscriptions through mobile phone networks.This presents a huge market for online trade - and one that local start-ups are keen to exploit.</body>

      <title>Preparing for the digital afterlife</title>
      <description>Society's struggle over who owns the dead's digital files</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24380211</url>

      <body>When 15-year-old Eric Rash committed suicide in 2011, his family and friends wanted to know why.In a bid to find answers, they went to Eric's Facebook account, and after failing to guess his password, appealed to the social media giant to grant them access.Facebook refused.Giving unauthorised access to someone other than the account holder, the company said, was against its privacy policy.The Rashes, who live in Virginia, tried to fight their case in court, but soon found there just wasn't any legislation that covered the management of "digital assets".The family's tragic battle is just one of many examples in which the internet has been shown to be woefully unprepared for dealing with death.In the two years since the Rashes' case, which led to the drafting of a federal law concerning the data of minors, few countries have issued clear guidance on the rights of families to access their deceased loved ones' data.And despite the fact that we put more of our lives in the cloud than ever before, few of us are preparing for our digital afterlife."We're accumulating far more digital records in our lives than we are physical ones," says Evan Carroll, who runs The Digital Beyond, a website which explores the subject of digital death."But we haven't yet entered the age where we are taking the question of what happens to those records seriously."Since Mr Carroll and his friend John Romano first raised the issue of the digital afterlife at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in 2009, some prominent companies have developed policies for dealing with deceased customers.Google has a step-by-step process allowing users to plan what they want done with their account, and will sometimes provide the contents of an email account which hasn't left specific instructions, after a "careful review".Facebook and Yahoo have taken a stricter stance, and won't hand over data without a court order, but the former allows relatives to choose whether they want to close an account or turn it into a memorial page.However many web companies are lagging behind.Cloud-based services which store our financial details, emails, music collections, social media interactions, photos and many other potentially precious items have different policies on data ownership, if indeed they have any.As a result, it is more difficult to bequeath your iTunes library to a loved one than it is to leave your CD collection to them in a shoebox.So why are we leaving our digital identities hostage to fortune?Part of the problem is that internet users have tended to be too young to be worrying about their mortality.But as the average browser gets older (the Office for National Statistics reckons almost 70% of all 65-74-year-olds in the UK are online), the idea of drafting a "digital will" is taking hold."We've seen several thousands sign up to our various membership packages," says Paul Golding, who co-launched Cirrus Legacy - a service which allows you to record login details for all your online accounts and leave instructions to a nominated guardian - just a year ago."People are beginning to realise what they could lose."Putting details of your online life in an actual will is not an option, as they are publicly accessible documents, but highlighting where they can be found is a safer bet. Although with passwords and usernames changing all the time, the challenge is to keep the information up to date.Digital estate planning, as the process of filing your details with a third party has become known, is an increasingly popular business, and many online services offer much more than simply making arrangements for accessing accounts.Some, such as My Wonderful Life, allow members to write messages to be sent to their dear ones from beyond the grave. Others, such as the ifidie Facebook app, give people the opportunity to share a posthumous joke, or record a confessional video to be released upon their demise.But it is the more conventional services offered by these companies which are proving vital to grieving families.Most of the time, families don't even know which online accounts their relative had signed up to, let alone the login details.And the cost of not knowing even a simple email password can be enormous, explains Evan Carroll."Email serves many purposes, only one of which is the digital equivalent of our mailboxes," he says. "It is the master key to many other accounts."But although leaving a list of your online accounts and passwords with a digital estate service might seem like a good solution, it is riddled with risks.Putting all your online security details in one place puts you at the mercy of a successful hacking attack. And, as Mr Golding admits, if he received "correct information" from a court of law, requiring him to hand over a list of passwords, he would "have to comply".Furthermore, using the login details left by a dead family member is potentially illegal. The terms and conditions of most established online services state that nobody other than the owner is allowed to use the account.Your loved ones may also not thank you for some posthumous revelations. Details of extra-marital affairs or a gambling addiction, which would otherwise have been taken to the grave, could be made available to mourners.But although much of the digital will-making process is still being ironed out, Mr Carroll urges people to do something, even if it is just writing a manual list and putting it in a safe place known only to a spouse."Many people say 'I don't have anything that I care about online'," he says."But you never know what will one day be of value to your family."</body>

      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on selected buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation… and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <title>How to get broadband to rural UK</title>
      <description>How to get broadband to rural Britain</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24366190</url>
      <date>1381100451</date>
      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <body>A man from Port Glasgow has been formally arrested in Pakistan along with three other men in connection with the murder of his wife.Abdul Sattar's wife Mumtaz was killed in Pakistan on 21 September.Mr Sattar, 40, claimed the couple were drugged, attacked and thrown out of a taxi shortly after arriving in Lahore.They had been on their way to see his parents in Punjab. Mrs Sattar later died and was buried in Shahkot.Her husband has been detained in custody by police.The announcement was made at a media conference in Glasgow held by relatives of Mrs Sattar and the family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar.Mr Anwar said: "I can advise that Abdul Sattar has now been formally arrested and is presently in custody."I was advised by the investigating officer yesterday evening that all of Mumtaz Sattar's property, including her jewellery, as well as Mr Sattar's credit cards, passport and £3,500, were recovered yesterday. Included in the items was Mumtaz's diary."Mr Anwar said police in Pakistan had found a white car which Mr Sattar had said was a taxi used to transport him and his wife from outside the security perimeter of the airport in Lahore.The police had confirmed the vehicle was not a taxi, Mr Anwar said. He added that Mr Sattar had been seen on CCTV greeting males from the white car.He added: "Three other suspects in the murder have also been formally arrested. These men, who were on the run following the recovery of the white car on Sunday, are allegedly linked to the white car and to Abdul Sattar."Mr Anwar said he expected all four accused men to appear in court on Saturday, with bail likely to be opposed by the police.Scottish police have been helping the Pakistani authorities with their investigation.Last weekend the governor of the Punjab region, former Glasgow MP Mohammad Sarwar, assured Mrs Sattar's relatives that "justice will be done".</body>

      <body>A man who murdered a pensioner in his own home in West Lothian has been jailed for life.Keiryn Nisbet had denied killing Robert Simpson, 67, known as Ronnie, in Mayfield Drive, Armadale, on 6 October 2012.Nisbet, 22, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years before being eligible for parole.Sentencing Nisbet, judge Norman Ritchie QC said: "You are a danger to the public."He added: "This was a horrific and sustained attack on an old man in his own home."Nisbet entered the flat of Mr Simpson, who was a complete stranger, and repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on his head and body.He also struck Mr Simpson on the head with a blunt instrument and dragged him across the floor of his house.Mr Simpson received a number of blows to his head, but died as a result of injuries to his body which included fractured ribs.At the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Ritchie added: "For no known reason you assaulted Mr Simpson. This brutal and senseless attack left Mr Simpson lying dying in the living room of his flat."Mr Simpson had left his front door unlocked and it is thought Nisbet, who had been drinking for 10 hours and taken heroin and cocaine, may have gone inside thinking it was a former girlfriend's home.Once inside he subjected Mr Simpson, who was sitting watching television, to the violent attack.The police were called, but when they arrived they found Mr Simpson's home in darkness and left after seeing no signs of a disturbance.During that time Nisbet was in the flat with Mr Simpson.Judge Ritchie told Nisbet: "You did not get help for him. He either died in front of you or you left him to die alone."Nisbet showed no remorse and later tried to get into a nightclub before heading to a house party.When questioned by police he denied ever being in Mr Simpson's home, but was caught by forensic evidence as palm and fingerprints were found in the flat, along with footwear impressions, blood and DNA.Distinctive fibres from a red hooded top he was wearing that evening were also found while CCTV evidence and witnesses also placed him near the scene.Nisbet, who was on bail at the time, sent a message to a friend on Facebook saying he had attacked a man but could not fully remember what he had done.He continues to insist he is innocent.Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for High Court cases in the east of Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet subjected Robert Simpson, a quiet and frail man who walked with the aid of a walking stick, to a sustained, vicious and unprovoked attack in his own home."Det Ch Insp Robert Cowper, of Police Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet did not know Ronnie Simpson and throughout or enquiries we have been unable to establish any possible motive for this violent attack, which resulted in the 67-year-old's death."He has proven himself to be a cold and callous individual, who has shown no remorse for his actions and the impact they have had on Mr Simpson's family."With Keiryn Nisbet now set to spend a considerable period of time behind bars, I sincerely hope that Mr Simpson's family can put this horrendous ordeal behind them and begin to move on with their lives."</body>

      <title>Higgs did not know he had won Nobel</title>
      <description>Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs reveals he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.</description>

      <body>Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.He added: "She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'"The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.He added: "I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages."The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.The existence of the so-called "God particle", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: "How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming."An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.Prof Higgs added: "In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime."But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there".Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: "I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern."I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels."Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive."But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists."Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960."Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: "It's very nice to be right sometimes."</body>

      <title>Call for regional asylum centres</title>
      <description>A refugee charity calls for regional screening centres to be set up, to process applications from asylum seekers who arrive in Scotland.</description>

      <body>A refugee charity has called for regional screening centres to be set up to process applications from asylum seekers.Almost everyone seeking asylum in the UK currently has to travel to Croydon, in south London, to submit their application.The Scottish Refugee Council said many refugees could not afford to travel.A Home Office spokesman said the majority of applicants were located close to Croydon.A Home Affairs Select Committee report published on Friday was highly critical of the current system.In their report, MPs said they heard evidence from Debora Singer of the Asylum Aid charity, who described how a pregnant asylum seeker based in Scotland was required to travel overnight to Croydon for a morning appointment, despite the protestations of the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC).The woman went into labour on the steps of the asylum screening unit.Nina Murray, a women's policy officer with SRC, said the report was a "significant and powerful critique of a system that is really failing quite a lot of people, and particularly the most vulnerable people".She pointed out that, under very exceptional circumstances, the most vulnerable asylum seekers were able to be screened in regional centres, but said it was becoming "increasingly difficult" to prove people were genuinely unable to travel to Croydon.Ms Murray told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "Many people arrive having spent their last penny trying to get out of a difficult situation and don't have any money - they may be destitute."Quite a lot of people do fetch up in Scotland. We're not quite sure how and why but there are issues around trafficking, around smuggling, people do come off the backs of lorries and turn up on our doorstep."But also people may be living legally in the country and the situation changes, for example Syrians who may have been studying in Scotland and are now unable to return home."She added: "We already have a Home Office office in Brand Street in Govan here in Glasgow. That is mainly a reporting centre for people to report to, and they also carry out some asylum interviews there, but at the moment people are told that to lodge an application they have to travel all the way to Croydon."We don't think it would be a huge ask for everybody to be screened here in Scotland. Other countries of a comparable size do have various regional screening centres and we know that this is an issue for other parts of the UK, such as Liverpool or Wales, that are also quite far from Croydon."Ms Murray said it was currently charities such as SRC and the Edinburgh-based Refugee Survival Trust who were paying for bus tickets to allow people to get to Croydon.She added: "We don't see that as sustainable".Among the other issues raised by the Home Affairs Committee were complaints about the length of time it took to get interviews at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon, with one legal representative making more than 200 phone calls in a month without being able to book any appointments.A further criticism was that, unlike the regional offices, the unit does not offer childcare.This means that children are present when parents are making their claim to the screening officer, which the committee said could inhibit disclosure as many parents would not discuss acts of sexual violence or torture in front of their children.The report added: "Despite the fact that childcare is offered at the regional offices, the letters inviting applicants for interview still state that childcare is not available and that they should not bring their children with them."This has been repeatedly raised with the Home Office over the past two years but the standard invitation letter has not been amended."The committee recommended that the Home Office amend its guidance to ensure that any applicant who is disabled or pregnant is offered a screening appointment at a regional centre.In cases where the applicant is the primary carer of a child under the age of 16, childcare should be made available to those who need it for their interviews, and this should be made clear in the invitation letters, it added.A Home Office spokesman said: "Asylum seekers are expected to claim asylum as soon as they arrive in the UK, at the airport or seaport of entry."For those who do not claim asylum on arrival, or whose circumstances change while in the UK, asylum applications can be registered at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon."This location, ten miles south of central London, is based on where the majority of applicants are located."</body>

      <description>Police are criticised for their handling of a suicide case in Edinburgh after investigators found they "mismanaged" the inquiry.</description>

      <body>Police have been criticised for their handling of a suicide case in Edinburgh after investigators found they "mismanaged" the inquiry.John McNeill, the independent police investigations and review commissioner, has made recommendations for the future handling of potential suicide cases.It follows the discovery of a woman's body in Clermiston in June 2013.Her body was found the day after officers had rejected claims by her family that she appeared suicidal.In a summary of his findings, the commissioner made six separate recommendations to the Chief Constable of Police Scotland.They range from calling for an investigation into the actions of the police officers dealing with the missing person inquiry, to a recommendation that the Police Scotland Mental Health and Place of Safety standard operating procedure (SOP) is updated to provide additional guidance to officers dealing with people reported to be suicidal.The independent investigation looked into the handling of the 36-year-old woman's disappearance.Her body was found by a dog walker in Clermiston Woods.Police had received a call from the woman's estranged husband the previous evening to say he was worried that his wife appeared to want to kill herself.Officers were aware she had recently tried to commit suicide, the PIRC investigation found.They visited the woman's home in Edinburgh but concluded the call was malicious after interviewing her and her 16-year-old son.She was not seen alive again after leaving her home later that evening.A missing person inquiry was launched after a suicide note was found at her home the following day.The PIRC investigation found the case was not immediately treated as a high priority because officers judged the note did not contain any obvious suicidal tendencies and could have been fabricated.The woman's phone was active when she was first reported missing but the battery had died by the time officers tried to trace it, "hampering" the investigation.The PIRC report said: "Police officers erred in their assessment of the circumstances and this impacted upon their decision-making, which included that the call appeared to have been malicious"The missing person inquiry was mismanaged. The missing person inquiry should have been immediately graded a high priority."Communications data to locate the woman's phone should have been sought on an emergency basis early in the inquiry. Delays in obtaining and interpreting this data hampered the investigation."A search for the woman should have been undertaken."The PIRC also found additional information from the woman's family about her intentions may have allowed the force to "reappraise" its earlier decisions.Professor McNeill said: "Following my investigation, I have made a number of recommendations both specific to this case and more wide-ranging, particularly in relation to the guidance that is available to officers dealing with incidents such as this."A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police Scotland thanks the PIRC for their report, which outlines a number of findings following an investigation."Our thoughts are also with the family of the deceased at this difficult time."It is clear that a number of learning points exist in relation to this incident and we will study all the evidence provided by the PIRC."We note that the PIRC have made a number of recommendations, which includes investigating the actions of specific officers."This point, alongside all recommendations, will be investigated to ensure Police Scotland provide the highest of standards of service to the public."</body>

      <body>A man who groomed a 14-year-old girl and had sex with her in a tent on a beach has been jailed.Sean Clode befriended the teenager while playing games online and she travelled from her home in northern Scotland to meet him.The 21-year-old, of Glamis Walk, Hartlepool denied sexual grooming, child abduction and sexual activity with a child, but was found guilty.He was sentenced to a six-year term by the judge at Teesside Crown Court.Clode was also subjected to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, and must sign the sex offenders register.The trial heard that the girl told her parents she was going to school but instead met up with Clode and spent 20 hours in a tent on dunes at Crimdon Dene.Her disappearance sparked a "frantic search" by her father, who drove through the night to search for her.The tent was later spotted by the crew of a police helicopter.Judge Howard Crowson said that his plan for the pair to meet up caused "unimaginable anxiety" for her parents."That she was a willing participant in these activities is no mitigation," he said."Her life and outlook have been completely distorted by you."You are a selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires."Det Con Chris Bryan of Cleveland Police, said: "Parents should view this case as a warning to check who their children are speaking to, not only on social networking sites but also over live chat when playing on games consoles."Sexual predators will use any opportunity possible to groom victims."</body>

      <title>Glasgay festival celebrates 20 years</title>
      <description>The Glasgay festival, which was one of the first celebrations of gay culture, is celebrating its 20th anniversary.</description>

      <body>The Glasgay festival, which was one of the first celebrations of gay culture, is celebrating its 20th anniversary.It has become one of the biggest of its kind in the UK, despite almost failing in year one when councillors tried to stop its funding.Festival director Steven Thomson said even though equality had moved out into society, the event was still important."There's still many stories from the past and and still many stories of future to tell," he said.He added: "We commission with an intention to look at social issues. Our work is dominated by social issues."There are still many of our community who struggle to come out, who struggle with family issues, who struggle with mental health, and just struggle with their whole identity."Back in 1993, councillors at Glasgow City Council wanted to block the festival under Section 28 legislation, which prevented the promotion of gay culture.Performers hit back. Sir Ian Mckellen said at the time: "It is their values that are rotten to the core, and Glasgay is a beacon of sanity in a hypocritical and naughty world."Festival founders including Cordelia Ditton decided it was important to press ahead despite the opposition from the local authority."I mean it was: 'We don't want that here'," she said."And yet there was so much going on under the surface. There were so many people ready to do something like this."And remember it was only two or three years after the Section 28 legislation had been passed, so there was a real feeling amongst the gay community that it was time to act."Section 28 was abolished by the Scottish Parliament in 2000, and since then and Equality Act and a Civil partnership Act have been introduced.Glasgow City Council is now one of the festival's key sponsors.Poet and playwright Jackie Kay, whose play Twilight Shift was among the productions in the festival's first year, has returned to the festival this year with The Maw Broon Monologues.She said festivals like Glasgay had been the catalyst for change."I think it's completely culture that's changed attitudes," she said."I think that when politics changes, culture will have been there first."She said creative people, from poets to visual artists, were always one step ahead.She added: "But that's the way it should be."You should always have cultural voices that question the status quo."</body>

      <body>A meeting is set to highlight the impact on a Scots loch of non-native crayfish which are now causing problems feeding cattle on nearby farms.North American signal crayfish are said to have "almost completely destroyed" the biodiversity of Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway.There is evidence they are getting into crops being gathered for silage.Regulations prohibit the transport of the crayfish which means farmers are unable to use it to feed their cattle.The problem at Loch Ken has existed for a number of years.Millions of the crayfish have infested the once-thriving angling waters.There have been calls for a five-year cull to help control their spread.New Galloway community councillor John Thom estimated the situation was already costing more than £1m-a-year to the local economy.He has now organised a meeting with Scottish Natural Heritage in the area on Tuesday to discuss the situation."They are undermining the flood defences, they are eating the ground-nesting birds and all the marine life in the whole surrounding area so now the bird watchers aren't coming," he said."Great-crested newts, the frogs, all the marine life in the area and its ecological system is actually being ruined."Mr Thom said local landowners had been invited to the meeting because of the effect it was starting to have beyond the waters of the loch."It is now also affecting the farmers because they are picking them up in the silage bales," he said."According to the rules and regulations that means they can't move their silage bales to feed their beasts over the winter because they would be illegally transporting the American signal crayfish."</body>

      <body>Joint administrators have been appointed to run a pharmaceuticals plant in Dumfries and Galloway.It is understood 30 staff have been laid off so far at the Bakhu Pharma factory at Newbie near Annan.The news comes just over two years after the company saved the site from closure.The previous owners Phoenix Chemicals also went into administration and Bakhu Pharma staged a "last minute rescue" of the plant in 2011.The factory - originally commissioned by Glaxo in 1980 - has gone through a number of hands in recent years.In October 2008 Indian-owned Shasun Pharma announced plans to close the facility as it was "no longer viable".A year later Merseyside-based Phoenix Chemicals bought the plant with the help of a Scottish government grant of £400,000.However, that business went into administration in January 2011 before the site was taken on by Bakhu Pharma.</body>

      <title>Elephants 'understand human gesture'</title>
      <description>African elephants demonstrate what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.</description>

      <date>1381448247</date>
      <body>African elephants have demonstrated what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.In a series of tests, researcher Ann Smet, of the University of St Andrews, offered the animals a choice between two identical buckets, then pointed at the one containing a hidden treat.From the first trial, the elephants chose the correct bucket.The results are published in the journal Current Biology.The scientists worked with captive elephants at a lodge in Zimbabwe.Prof Richard Byrne, a co-author on the research, said the elephants had been rescued from culling operations and trained for riding."They specifically train the elephants to respond to vocal cues. They don't use any gestures at all," said Prof Byrne."The idea is that the handler can walk behind the elephant and just tell it what to do with words."Despite this, the animals seemed to grasp the meaning of pointing from the outset. This makes them the only non-human animals to understand the gesture without being trained to do so.In previous studies, Prof Byrne said, our closest primate cousins, the chimpanzees, proved to be "hopeless" at at similar task.Ms Smet added that she had been impressed by the animals' apparently innate understanding of the gesture."Of course we had hoped that the elephants would be able to learn to follow human pointing, or we wouldn't have done the experiment in the first place," she said."But it was really surprising that they didn't seem to have to learn anything."It seems that understanding pointing is an ability elephants just possess naturally and they are cognitively much more like us than has been realised."Prof Byrne said studying elephants helped build a map of part of the evolutionary tree that is very distant from humans."They're so unrelated to us," he told BBC News. "So if we find human-like abilities in an animal like an elephant, that hasn't shared a common ancestor with people for more than 100 million years , we can be pretty sure that it's evolved completely separately, by what's called convergent evolution."The researchers said their findings might explain how elephants have successfully been tamed and have "historically had a close bond with humans, in spite of being potentially dangerous and unmanageable due to their great size".But the scientists added the results could be a hint that the animals gesture to one another in the wild with their "highly controllable trunks".Ms Smet told BBC News: "The next step [in our research] is to test whether when an elephant extends its trunk upwards and outwards - as they regularly do, such as when detecting a predator, this functions as a point."</body>

Reports suggest the closure could take place in 2015.The revamp is aimed at cutting journey times across the central belt.The Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme (Egip) electrification of the main line between the two cities should be completed by the end of 2016.However, it is not until the end of 2018 that a target journey time of 42 minutes is expected to be met, through a phased replacement of the diesel fleet.Campaigners had raised fears the line could shut at the Winchburgh tunnel in West Lothian for 12 weeks.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: "Network Rail have confirmed they expect the closure to last around 44 days - significantly less than the 12 week period reported, and will be carried out in the summer months with all rail connections maintained via diversionary routes."We will be working with our rail partners to bring the 44 day closure in further still and will keep passengers updated on progress."Delivering a major programme such as Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Project (EGIP) in a live railway environment will always be a challenging undertaking. However, we are confident that working together Network Rail and First ScotRail will minimise passenger disruption across the network during the EGIP works."The Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme will see train services between Glasgow and Edinburgh increase to 13 services per hour.A Network Rail spokesman said: "Our current estimate is around 44 days, but we are in the process of considering the optimum delivery methodology."Once this process is complete we will finalise a delivery programme for this element of the EGIP works."</body>

      <body>Two Stirling councillors have withdrawn a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown outside Stirling Council's headquarters.Tory member Callum Campbell suggested the debate which was seconded by Labour member Danny Gibson.The proposal had been condemned by some nationalists.On Thursday the councillors withdrew the motion, saying they did not want it to be a "distraction" from the "real issues of uncertainty".At present the council flies two flags at its headquarters - a conventional St Andrew's Cross and a specially-modified Saltire, which also includes the lion rampant and emblems from the city's coat of arms.The suggested motion would have seen both the Union flag and the modified Saltire flown.The Union flag would have been flown outside the council building while the Saltire would have been on the flagpole in the grounds between the building and the main road.Stirling is run by a coalition of Labour and Conservative councillors, although the SNP is the largest single party.After withdrawing the motion due to be debated on Thursday evening, Councillor Campbell said: "I don't want this motion to become a distraction from the real issues of uncertainty that the SNP are asking us to decide upon next year, so I have written to the provost withdrawing my motion."On Thursday, 18 September next year, the electorate in Scotland will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"Policies on which flags are flown vary from council to council.Some fly the St Andrew's Cross, the union flag and the EU flag or a corporate logo. Others fly just one flag and change it depending on the occasion.Glasgow City Council normally flies the St Andrew's Cross above the city chambers but replaces it with a Union flag on royal birthdays and some other special occasions.</body>

      <body>A proposal by Stirling Council aimed at ending a dispute over pay and conditions has been rejected by unions.The dispute has centred on the council's plan for a 0.5% pay cut across all pay grades and an additional hour of work per week.The new offer included a guarantee to restore the pay cut, and implement a national 1% pay rise, at a future date.Unions said the plans did not address the key issues of working more hours and changes to terms and conditions.The council's revised offer included:Stewards from JTUC, Unison, Unite, GMB and UCATT unions unanimously rejected the proposals after a meeting on Monday.They said the proposals also introduced performance-related pay and terms.The council expressed disappointment and said more than 90% of the council's 3,000 employees had signed up to the new terms and conditions.However, unions have said their members were only signing up "under protest" in order to keep their jobs.Unison has described the 0.5% cut as equivalent to a 1.5% pay cut after council staff across Scotland narrowly accepted a below-inflation 1% pay rise.It has also claimed the proposed extra 7.5 days of work a year meant it actually amounted to a 4.5% pay cut for most staff.The council has said the changes are necessary as it needs to make savings of £24m due to a real terms cut in the funding it receives from the Scottish government.It said the proposals amounted to an average pay reduction of £10 a month for middle and higher paid employees.The lowest grades will have a pay increase to £7.50 an hour as part of the council's ongoing commitment to the Living Wage, it said.Bob Jack, Stirling Council chief executive, said: "We are very disappointed that union officials have rejected these very positive proposals without asking their members for their views."The votes taken on industrial action are now some months old, they attracted only a few hundred votes, and were based on a very different set of conditions."Unison said it had been unable to share the proposals with its members as it was locked into a confidentiality agreement. The council said this agreement had been requested by the union.Unison said it would step up its campaign to pursue further "fair, meaningful negotiations".</body>

      <body>A Royal Navy lieutenant crashed his yacht into an oil tanker in The Solent after sailing too close during a Cowes Week race, a court has heard.Roland Wilson, 32, of Stanley, Perthshire, is accused of negligence in the moments before the collision with the 120,000-ton vessel in August 2011.Prosecutors allege Mr Wilson sailed into the path of the tanker, despite having seen it from five miles away.Mr Wilson denies three counts of contravening maritime regulations.One member of the eight-strong crew of the 33ft (10m) racing yacht suffered head injuries in the collision, while another abandoned ship, Southampton Magistrates Court heard.Mr Wilson, who was a serving officer at the time of the crash, but is now a reservist, owned and skippered the yacht - called Atalanta of Chester - during the regatta.Despite shipping by-laws requiring vessels to maintain a safe distance from larger ships, the Atalanta crashed into the 853ft-long (260m) Hanne Knutsen tanker, which was heading to Fawley oil refinery.Charles Row, prosecuting, said: "The sea was calm, visibility was excellent, in excess of 10 miles (16km), with 10 to 12 knots of wind."Unfortunately, despite these favourable conditions, the Atalanta was towards the back of the race, nevertheless she was making seven knots."Mr Row said Wilson failed to comply with a "moving prohibited zone" of 1,000m (0.6 miles) in front and 100m (328ft) either side of a vessel greater than 150m (492ft).He said the situation had been complicated by a motor vessel that suffered engine failure to the tanker's starboard, forcing the Hanne Knutsen to change its course.Mr Row said, although the tanker had begun to make a port turn, the Atalanta should not have been in such a close position and Mr Wilson failed to turn on the yacht's engines to avoid the collision.He said, under the circumstances, the action would have been permitted under race rules and would not have led to his disqualification.Describing the collision to the court, Mr Row said: "One of the crew took the decision to abandon ship approximately five or six seconds before the collision."He passed down the starboard side of the Hanne Knutsen. Having abandoned ship he was picked up by a spectator vessel."The Atalanta mast struck the bow of the Hanne Knutsen and was pivoted round to the port. She was dismasted and one of her crew suffered head injuries which required hospital treatment."Mercifully, there was no other injury as a result of what happened."The trial continues.</body>

      <date>1381472847</date>
      <body>New financial powers already agreed for Scotland will be a "considerable challenge" to implement, a Holyrood committee has warned.MSPs are concerned about the level of information provided by the UK and Scottish governments to help with the provisions of the Scotland Act 2012.This includes a new rate of income tax due to come into force in April 2016.The Scottish government agreed that more clarity was needed and said it was working on this with the Treasury.The new tax rate will involve the Treasury deducting 10p from standard and upper rates of income tax in Scotland and giving MSPs the power to decide how to raise money.But Holyrood's Finance Committee said there was a lack of clarity about forecasts, particularly with the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).It found that considerable work would be needed by both governments to agree proposals to adjust the block grant allocated to Scotland by Westminster.MSPs also have concerns about "wildly optimistic" OBR forecasts for the land and building transaction tax (LBTT), which replaces stamp duty land tax in April 2015.They said forecasting for a new landfill tax must be transparent and open.Finance committee convener Kenneth Gibson MSP said: "We believe it is essential that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation process and, in particular, the way in which the UK government will adjust Scotland's block grant to take account of the new financial powers."We will continue to closely monitor the accuracy of the OBR forecasts and will take evidence from the chair of the OBR on an annual basis."The report concluded: "The committee recognises that there is a considerable challenge for both the UK government and the Scottish government in implementing the financial provisions of the Scotland Act 2012."Nevertheless, it is essential that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation process."The report added: "The committee is concerned about the level of information being provided by the two governments as the negotiations progress."At the same time, the committee welcomes the commitment of the Scottish government to consult with the Scottish Parliament on the adjustments to the block grant and emphasises the need for sufficient time to be made available to allow the committee to carry out effective scrutiny of the proposal."A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "We welcome this report and the recognition of the Scottish government's work to take forward the financial provisions of the Scotland Act."We agree that the Scottish Parliament and people require greater clarity over changes to the allocation of the block grant and the Scottish government is working actively with HM Treasury to achieve that."While welcome, the tax raising powers to be transferred to the Scottish Parliament through the Scotland Act represent a missed opportunity, only giving Parliament control over an additional 17% of Scotland's revenues."With full fiscal and economic powers the Scottish Parliament could do more to realise Scotland's full economic potential."</body>

      <body>Tourism in Scotland has enjoyed a "resurgence" following a challenging year for the sector, Tourism Minister Fergus Ewing has said.Official figures showed visitor numbers in the 12 months to June were 1% down on the previous year, with spend falling 6%.But the first six months of this year showed a slight rise in both visitor numbers and spending.Mr Ewing called the first-half figures "encouraging".The Office for National Statistics recorded a total of 6.5 million domestic and international visitors between January and June - 1.6% more than the same period last year.Tourism spend also rose by 1.7% in the first half, bringing overall expenditure in Scotland between January and June to £1.8bn.Domestic holidays continued to prove popular, with the number of staycations increasing by 2%.During the second quarter of the year, international visitor numbers were also 2% higher than the same period last year.Tourism minister Fergus Ewing said: "The growth in tourism during the first half of 2013 shows a resurgence in both domestic and international markets."Growth in international tourists has mainly been due to a rise in visitors from emerging markets, with an increase in visitor numbers from countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Brazil."New air routes such as the re-introduction of direct air links from Canada, and Easyjet, starting new routes from Europe to Scotland, will open up our country to more visitors."Virgin's new routes into Scotland from Heathrow have connected Scotland to more than 30 global destinations and already we are seeing tour operators launching new tourist packages to Scotland as a result."He added: "Despite this resurgence, last year was a challenging time for the tourism economy, and this is still impacting on visitor figures and spend."Last month, Historic Scotland reported a "record-breaking" summer for Scotland's visitor attractions.It said there were nearly 1.7 million visitors, an increase of 14.8% on the same period last year.Records were broken at "flagship" site Edinburgh Castle, with numbers up 26% on 2012 for the period June to August.August saw 229,940 visitors at the castle, more than any month ever.</body>

      <body>Scotland's public spending watchdog is in dispute with the taxman over a £4.1m bill, it has emerged.Audit Scotland boss Caroline Gardner told MSPs that HMRC is seeking to recoup VAT rebates which it believes were wrongly paid.The organisation said it had not budgeted for the tax demand and was challenging the bill.The issue came to light at a meeting of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit (SCPA) at Holyrood.HMRC said the VAT rebates had been wrongly paid to Audit Scotland since 2006, which is understood to have recouped the tax incurred by external companies that it contracted in to do audit work.Scotland's auditor general Caroline Gardner said: "We have just been through a four-year budget strategy in which we have reduced the cost of audit by more than 20%."I struggle to see how we could reduce our costs by anything approaching that amount."We would continue to apply that pressure, but the options we would have would be to ask the SCPA for funding or look at recovering it through local government fees, neither of which is palatable."In a letter to the SPCA, the parliamentary body which polices the watchdog, Ms Gardner warned the debt could have a knock-on effect for local authorities, which could see their fees for audit work increased by around 5%.She added: "We believe HMRC have some fundamental misunderstandings about the current arrangements and have responded robustly."It also emerged that a second tax dispute, worth £160,000, has been settled.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail shares jump sharply</title>
      <description>Shares in Royal Mail rise as high as 456p in conditional trading - up 38% on their initial 330p offer price - before easing back.</description>

      <date>1381493626</date>
      <body>Royal Mail shares rose more than 38% to 456p at the start of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p per share, valuing the 500-year-old company at £3.3bn. The value rose £1.1bn after trading began.At midday, the shares had eased back to 435p, 31.8% up. Private investors received 227 shares each.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Business Secretary Vince Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.Martin O'Brien from Glasgow: Thanks SSE. It turns out I can switch and save an estimated £174 per year (based on pre-increase cost), plus I'll get £100 cash back after three months for switching, and I've been paying too much on direct debit so they owe me £490. That's the most productive 10 minutes I've spent this year.John Hewitt from Nottingham: I have never been one to change suppliers but I will now. I have been a very happy SSE customer for more than 10 years and will always remember it was SSE that made it possible to get cheap electricity for a while. Yes, other suppliers will follow and raise their prices too, but initially it will be cheaper to move.Gordon Porter from Oban in Scotland: I'm not totally surprised and all other suppliers will follow suit. Gas and electricity should be run by a very light touch government for the benefit of all users and investors. Government should also have a coherent energy policy and if they require additional generating capacity should help to pay for any additions.Stephen Mcnulty from Leeds: There have been rumours around of this price rise for months, anyone that didn't fix is stupid.Brian Pritchard from Edenfield, Lancashire: I suppose all the companies will increase prices now in a similar way, so what is the point of scrapping around to save perhaps a few pence if you are lucky? It's extremely disappointing especially when the government is following the austerity path that we have seen for the last few years.Paul Sutheran from Dudley, West Midlands: This is utterly disgraceful. Our income is falling year on year, yet they raise prices approximately three times the rate of inflation. The transparency we were promised has not materialised and the costs/methods of collecting the money from the customer are impossible to fathom. Energy is a national interest at every level and should not have been put into the hands of people whose motivation is profit.Chris Jenkins from Wallasey, Merseyside: Part of my job is to help people with utilities issues in commercial and residential premises and I can tell you from first hand experience that utilities companies act disgracefully.</body>

      <body>IT services provider CGI is to open a new software development centre in Glasgow, creating nearly 250 skilled jobs over the next few years.The Open Source Digital Services Centre, which will offer services to clients in European public and commercial sectors, will open in 2014.The roles will range from highly skilled technical and managerial staff to graduate jobs and apprenticeships.The move will see CGI nearly double its Scottish workforce within three years.First Minister Alex Salmond welcomed the Canadian company's investment in Scotland.He said: "The move by CGI to create 250 skilled jobs is very positive and is a yet another welcome boost for Scottish employment, reinforcing our position of outperforming the UK for securing inward investment."This is testament to both the skill of the Scottish workforce and the confidence international companies have in Scotland as a country to invest in."CGI UK president Tim Gregory said: "The two main reasons we selected Glasgow as the location for our new centre were the talent pool of highly skilled professionals available in the area, and the support we received from the Scottish government."We are very excited about the future for this area of our business."</body>

      <body>Supporters Direct Scotland has agreed to chair a working party to look at possible ways to move Kilmarnock towards community ownership.It follows Thursday's offer from club chairman Michael Johnston of a club-led working party with the prospect of just two fans on a newly-formed board.Sections of the support are unhappy with Johnston's running of the Scottish Premiership club.And Supporters Direct Scotland met fans groups to discuss the chairman's offer.Supporters Direct Scotland head Paul Goodwin said: "Following a vote, and subsequent request, from a gathering of around 500 Kilmarnock fans from recognised fans groups - The Kilmarnock Supporters Trust and The Kilmarnock Football Club Supporters Association - Supporters Direct Scotland has agreed to chair a working party with the main focus being developing ways to bring their club into community ownership."The gathering, on 10 October, agreed a range of measures that would be presented back to the fans, and to the club, in the near future."Supporters Direct Scotland also met with Michael Johnston and Billy Bowie of Kilmarnock FC on Wednesday of this week."At the meeting, we were asked whether there was a possibility of us pulling together a club-led working party of fans to look at community involvement."We highlighted the challenges involved in a club-led working party given the current concerns many fans have."We will now work with the fans on moving towards a more robust governance model and a pathway to community ownership and will continue to mediate with the club on these matters as required."Johnston's decision to offer Celtic fans discounted tickets for the Premiership game between the two sides was just the latest of his decisions to spark protests.However, he responded by saying he will hand season-ticket holders and shareholders the chance to elect a new board member each.Local politicians will also be invited to take part in the new company structure, while local businessman Billy Bowie has agreed to invest £1m in the club.</body>

      <body>Four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti has been released from hospital but faces further surgery after his high-speed crash at the Houston Grand Prix on Sunday.The Scot, 40, broke two vertebrae in his spine, two ribs and an ankle.His car flipped into the air following a final-lap collision with Takuma Sato, with at least 13 spectators injured by debris that flew over safety fencing.Franchitti said he was "overwhelmed by the outpouring of support".In a statement issued through IndyCar, the driver, who will need a second operation on a surgically stabilised right ankle, said he would be watching his Chip Ganassi team-mates Scott Dixon of New Zealand and Alex Tagliani of Canada on television."I look forward to watching Scott, Alex and the Target team next weekend on television, and will be pulling for them as they go for another championship."He added: "I'm thankful to have such a great family and such wonderful friends and fans. Thanks to everyone at the hospital and the track who took such good care of me during my stay in Houston."A statement from IndyCar said the three-time Indianapolis 500 winner would now be transported to Indianapolis, where his condition would be re-evaluated.During the second race of IndyCar's Grand Prix of Houston double-header on Sunday, Franchitti's car hit the back of Sato's and was propelled into the air and into the fence.His vehicle broke into several pieces but did not catch fire.Former Formula 1 driver Sato said his car "caught the marbles" - chunks of rubber that come off the tyres and lie on the track - before brushing the wall and losing momentum.An IndyCar official and 13 spectators were also hurt by flying debris from the three-vehicle smash that also involved Venezuelan EJ Viso's car. Both Viso and Sato were able to walk away.</body>

      <body>Defending Heineken Cup champions Toulon have made eight changes to the side that defeated Clermont in the Top 14 as they host Glasgow Warriors.Captain Jonny Wilkinson is among the big names returning to the French side who top their domestic league.Tommy Seymour, Ruaridh Jackson, Henry Pyrgos, Dougie Hall, Jon Welsh, Jonny Gray and Josh Strauss all start for Pro12 leaders Glasgow.Duncan Weir, Pat MacArthur, Moray Low and Richie Vernon drop to the bench.Glasgow go into the game on the back of five consecutive victories.But success in Europe has eluded the visitors, who lost five of their six group games last term and have not been involved in a knockout game since 1997-98.Scrum-half Chris Cusiter and flanker Rob Harley drop out of the squad this weekend, while Scotland colleagues Sean Lamont and Stuart Hogg miss the game through injury.Glasgow have announced that Hogg will be missing for several weeks after surgery on a wrist injury, while fellow full-back Peter Murchie will be out of action for six months after an operation on a shoulder injury.Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was under no illusion about the task facing his side."We've been pleased with our league form so far this season and we would like to continue that in Europe, but this is the ultimate test for us," he said."Playing the defending champions away from home is something we've been looking forward to since the beginning of the season."Stade Mayol is a wonderful arena to play in and playing such a quality side in the first game is a fantastic challenge for our squad."Big-spending Toulon, who have won their last 16 home matches in Europe, are again without star winger Bryan Habana, who damaged a hamstring during South Africa's loss to New Zealand.However, they are able to bring back former England captain Wilkinson at fly-half, who teams up with South African scrum-half Michael Claassens, while Josua Tuisova and David Smith are on the wings.Toulon pair two props signed in the summer, with Emmanuel Felsina being given his first Heineken Cup debut after his summer switch from Aix-en-Provence along with Italy international Martin Castrogiovanni, who arrived from Leicester Tigers.Juan Fernandez Lobbe, the Argentine former Leicester Tigers flanker, also comes into the pack, as does South Africa international Joe van Niekerk.Xavier Chiocci, fellow prop Carl Hayman, the New Zealander formerly of Newcastle Falcons, Steffon Armitage, the former Saracens flanker, Australia winger Drew Mitchell and France centre Mathieu Bastareaud drop to the bench.Flanker Pierrick Gunther, scrum-half Sébastien Tillous-Borde and France full-back Alexis Palisson miss out completely.Toulon : Delon Armitage; Josua Tuisova, Maxime Mermoz, Matthew Giteau, David Smith, Jonny Wilkinson (capt), Michael Claassens, Emmanuel Felsina, Jean-Charles Orioli, Martin Castrogiovanni, Bakkies Botha, Ali Williams, Juan Fernandez Lobbe, Joe van Niekerk, Chris Masoe.Replacements : Benjamin Noirot, Xavier Chiocci, Carl Hayman, Steffon Armitage, Mathieu Bastareaud, Drew Mitchell, Frederic Michalak, Danie Rossouw.Glasgow Warriors : S Maitland, T Seymour, M Bennett, A Dunbar, N Matawalu, R Jackson, H Pyrgos, R Grant, D Hall, J Welsh, J Gray, Al Kellock (capt), T Swinson, C Fusaro, J Strauss.Replacements: P MacArthur, M Low, E Kalman, J Eddie, R Vernon, D Weir, B McGuigan, DTH van der Merwe.</body>

      <title>Delhi prepares for baton arrival</title>
      <description>The Queen's Baton arrives at its first international destination</description>

      <body>The Queen's Baton Relay arrives at its first international destination today and it's a city which, three years ago, had observers like me on the edge of their seats.Delhi, the capital of India, was host city for the Commonwealth Games in 2010.There were predictions that the whole event would be in jeopardy because venue construction was way behind schedule.As teams arrived at the athletes village, concerns were raised that it was unfinished and dirty.But somehow everything came good and the opening ceremony was the dazzling spectacle that was needed to mark the end of controversy and the commencement of sport.Three years on and as the Queen's baton begins the build-up to the Glasgow games, I have returned to Delhi to see what legacy has been left.First stop is Pragati Maidan metro station, part of a network which has only been in existence for ten years and which was expanded for and beyond the games.At a cost of £2bn it is ultra-modern and takes two million people into the heart of the capital each day.One man emerging from the station tell me: "Driving is hell in Delhi, especially when you are commuting between Noida, Delhi and Gurgaon."It's difficult but with the metro it is so easy, you don't have to worry about traffic, you don't have to worry about accidents."A female resident adds: "That's the most convenient and comfortable way to commute in Delhi itself. That's the lifeline of Delhi."Before the metro she says "it was time consuming, hectic and now it's hazard free".But the metro hasn't exactly restored calm to this chaotic country.Although it carries two million people every day, the roads here are still hectic and packed with cars, buses, tuk-tuks and a range of unconventional transport means.Road markings still show a separate "games lane" for traffic, although that regulation is treated with the same disregard by drivers as many other rules.Even since the closing ceremony, the problems for the Commonwealth Games continued, culminating is the jailing of the Organising Committee's Chairman, Suresh Kalmadi, on corruption charges.The games cost £2.5bn and were ten times over budget.Politicians here don't want to talk about it, especially in the month before a local election.In fact the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, cancelled a planned interview with me at the last minute.Instead it was left to Dr A Didar Singh, Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce, to robustly defend Delhi's reputation.He told me: "First of all there was a massive investment and business benefits from that, almost $12bn worth of work happened."But I think more important that that is that it has given to us a permanent improved infrastructure for the city as a whole."The sports part is one end of it but more than ninety percent of the funding went into improving the city infrastructure."He cites 25 new flyovers, walkways, a new airport and hotel space as a tremendous boost to tourism.He adds: "Tourism, basically, means more business."Improvements have come in the main business and retail district, Connaught Place, which was due for a total renovation.It was supposed to be transformed in time for the 2010 games but work only started post-games and they're still finishing it off.International finance firm Grant Thornton India has a base in Connaught Place.Vishesh Chandoik, National Managing Partner, said: "We are used to most infrastructure projects in India suffering from time over runs so I wasn't surprised."But I was still very happy and think the end result is substantially better than we had before."There is still a lot that can be done but it's about being better tomorrow than we are today and as long as they keep making those improvements I've got no reason to complain."While admiring the iconic India Gate, the giant archway which commemorates those lost in war, I was aggressively herded away with the other tourists, which seemingly happens at five o'clock every day.It's maybe not the way tourists would be handled back home but illustrates the many cultural differences between here and the west.Passive observers in Glasgow might wonder how, precisely, Delhi benefited from the games when the city's reputation was torn to shreds by the many issues.But the reality is that this city is changing.The question is whether the games brought about the changes or whether they were used to symbolise them.Next week BBC Scotland will examine what sporting legacy the Delhi games created.</body>

      <title>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</title>
      <description>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22976781</url>
      <date>1381306559</date>
      <body>Three years after his release from almost three decades in prison, Nelson Mandela went to Glasgow to thank the city for its support in the fight against apartheid in his native South Africa.Nelson Mandela praised the "Citizens of Glasgow" for being the first to offer him the Freedom of the City, at a time more than a decade earlier when many others were still condemning him as a terrorist for his role in challenging the system of racial segregation in his home country.In a speech at the City Chambers in Glasgow on 9 October 1993, he said: "While we were physically denied our freedom in the country of our birth, a city 6,000 miles away, and as renowned as Glasgow, refused to accept the legitimacy of the apartheid system, and declared us to be free."Mandela's visit to Scotland's largest city in 1993, the year before he became president of the Republic of South Africa, was the culmination of a long association between people in the city and his campaign for freedom, which began when he was imprisoned in 1962.Scottish anti-apartheid activist Brian Filling campaigned from the 1960s against the system in South Africa which allowed the white minority to oppress the majority black inhabitants.He had joined the campaign when his parents got to know the English theatre director Cecil Williams, who had allowed Mandela to pretend to be his chauffeur and had been in the car with him when he was arrested.Mandela had been convicted of charges including conspiring to commit acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution.However, the trial was condemned by the United Nations Security Council and nations around the world.Mr Filling says that, despite some of the dreadful things happening in South Africa in 1960s and 70s, it was "not fashionable to be associated with Mandela because he was widely regarded and reported in our media as a terrorist".However in 1981, Glasgow Council decided to set its face against this opinion and awarded Mandela the Freedom of the City.Mr Filling remembers that just a couple of years earlier the previous Lord Provost of Glasgow, David Hodge, had hosted a lunch with the South African ambassador, which had sparked a protest outside the City Chambers and a threat by catering staff not to prepare the food.He says: "The incoming Lord Provost, Michael Kelly, partly as a reaction to all this, wanted to give the freedom of the city to Nelson Mandela."Dr Kelly says: "It was a bold step for the Labour Party in Glasgow because Mandela was regarded as a terrorist by a lot of people and many people thought Glasgow should not become involved in this at all."So it was an uphill struggle and we received a lot of bad publicity, but eventually when Mandela's story got through people began to see that we and he were in the right."Glasgow's promotion of Mandela's cause quickly led to other cities following suit and within a year Kelly had launched a declaration for the release of Nelson Mandela. It went on to gain support from 2,500 mayors from 56 countries around the world.The declaration got the backing of the United Nations in New York and Dr Kelly, on behalf of the city of Glasgow, had the "privilege" of being invited to speak first in support of the petition.In 1986, Glasgow brought more attention to the jailed freedom fighter by changing the name of St George's Place in the city centre to Nelson Mandela Place.The name change was made more significant by the fact that the South African consulate-general was based on the fifth floor of the Stock Exchange building, at an address which now bore the name of the country's most famous political prisoner.By now the efforts to free Mandela had become mainstream with global pop stars such as Jim Kerr, from Glasgow band Simple Minds, writing songs and playing concerts in support of his freedom.International pressure, in the form of sanctions against the South African regime, eventually led to Mandela's release.At the age of 71, Mandela was freed on 11 February 1990 after 27 years in prison.During the 1980s he had been given the Freedom of the City by nine UK regions - Aberdeen, Dundee, Greenwich, Islwyn in Gwent, Kingston Upon Hull, Midlothian, Newcastle, Sheffield and, of course, Glasgow.It was the city which was chosen to host Mandela as he arrived to accept all these awards in October 1993.Brian Filling, who set up the 1993 trip and spent two years getting agreement from all the other cities that Glasgow should be the venue, says: "He was very appreciative of the people of Britain for their support, rather than the government - which seemed to hold out against imposing sanctions on South Africa."I think there is a special place in terms of his heart and mind for the people of Scotland."Dr Kelly was able to ask Mandela if he knew about Glasgow awarding him the freedom of the city back in 1981, while he was locked up on Robben Island.The former lord provost says: "He confirmed there was a grapevine and through that he'd received these snippets of information. So at the time he had known about the award, and it kept him and his fellow prisoners going."Mr Filling says there had always been a concern about whether the man he had campaigned to free for so many years would live up to the "legend"."But in fact, he did. If anything, he was even greater than he had been imagined."</body>

      <title>Royal Mail shares jump sharply</title>
      <description>Shares in Royal Mail rise as high as 456p in conditional trading - up 38% on their initial 330p offer price - before easing back.</description>

      <body>Royal Mail shares rose more than 38% to 456p at the start of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p per share, valuing the 500-year-old company at £3.3bn. The value rose £1.1bn after trading began.At midday, the shares had eased back to 435p, 31.8% up. Private investors received 227 shares each.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Business Secretary Vince Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <title>Barclays to join Help to Buy scheme</title>
      <description>Barclays has become the latest bank to announce it is signing up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <body>Barclays has become the latest bank to announce it is signing up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.This means about two-thirds of lenders in the UK's mortgage market have said they will sign up to the project.The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.The move leaves Nationwide Building Society as the UK's only major mortgage lender yet to decide whether to join.Barclays has not yet published details of any rates or timing of mortgage products that fall under the Help to Buy umbrella."We are pleased to confirm that Barclays will participate in the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme," a spokesman for the bank said.Under the latest phase of the scheme, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is up to 0.9% of the original loan level. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Borrowers who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.Products are already on the market from RBS/NatWest and the Halifax, with Santander, HSBC, Virgin Money, Lloyds, TSB and Aldermore all saying that they will start offering products by the start of January.The government has said that the scheme will correct a problem in the market that locks out a number of tenants paying high rents and unable to save enough for a deposit, even though they could afford mortgage repayments.But Labour said the focus should be on house building, to correct a lack of supply of affordable homes.The latest news of Barclays' participation comes as mortgage lenders reported that the number of first-time buyers was already growing quickly from a low base.The Council of Mortgage Lenders said that the number of loans approved for first-time buyers rose by 33% in August compared with the same month a year earlier.</body>

      <body>Output in the construction industry fell slightly in August, although house-building was up, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).UK construction output slipped 0.1% in August, the ONS said. House-building picked up 1.6%, but activity in new public projects and repairs fell.The figures mark a sharp slowdown from July, when construction output rose by 2.8%.However, the August figure still means output is up 4% on the year.That it is the strongest annual increase since December 2011.Construction activity accounts for about 6.3% of the economy.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the August figures point to construction providing a strong boost to the economy in the third quarter."The turnaround so far this year has been quite remarkable," he said. "Having been contracting at an annual rate of 12.4% last December, the industry is now growing at a rate of 4%."The increasingly broad-based upturn (in construction) suggests that companies are beginning to increase their capital investment, which bodes well for the sustainability of the economic recovery."The government has been trying to encourage more house-building and says its Help to Buy scheme will bolster supply as well as demand.A private sector survey last week suggested that growth in the construction sector was stronger in the third quarter. The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index hit a near six-year peak in August before easing slightly in September.</body>

      <title>JPMorgan report loss on legal costs</title>
      <description>US bank JPMorgan Chase sets aside $9.2bn to cover legal expenses, leading to a third-quarter loss.</description>

      <body>JPMorgan Chase has reported a loss in the third quarter after setting aside $9.2bn (£5.8bn) to cover legal bills.The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year.JPMorgan is currently in talks with the US government over a potentially huge settlement relating to the sale of mortgage-related investment products in the run-up to the financial crisis.Last month, it paid $920m to settle charges related to a trading scandal.JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: "We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them."He stressed that the bank's underlying business was strong.Stripping out one-off charges, the bank made $5.8bn over the three months to the end of September.Wells Fargo, the biggest US mortgage lender, also reported results on Friday.It reported a record net income of $5.3bn in the third quarter, up 13% on the same period in 2012.That rise came despite a fall in income at its mortgage business, where revenue fell 43% to $1.6bn.The fall was offset by lower expenses and a reduction in funds set aside for loans going bad.JPMorgan now has a contingency fund of $23bn to cover legal expenses. It also said that it could face litigation-related expenses of another $6.8bn.It is currently in talks with the Justice Department over a potentially huge settlement, related to the mis-selling of mortgage related products during the US housing boom.It is thought the settlement could cost as much as $11bn.Mr Dimon stressed on Friday that much of the case related to deals done by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, companies that JPMorgan Chase bought during the financial crisis."The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues and one that recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the US government," he said.Last month, JPMorgan paid $920m to settle a case related to disastrous trades by Bruno Iksil, who earned the nickname the "London Whale" for his big bets on the financial markets.Last year, the bank admitted to losses of $6.2bn resulting from his activities.As part of the settlement deal, JPMorgan admitted violating US federal securities laws.</body>

      <description>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley has said.He said it could shift the "whole landscape of e-commerce" if it bought, for example, eBay.He said it should ignore the wishes of activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants the company to buy back stock."Apple's about building great products, building and shaping markets," Mr Sculley said."Carl Icahn has suggested to [Apple chief executive] Tim Cook, 'Why don't you buy more stock back or make a bigger dividend?'"I'd rather see Apple continue to invest in building... even make big acquisitions that were strategic, as opposed to buying more stock back, or giving more dividends."Mr Sculley was the chief executive of Apple between 1983 and 1993.During his tenure, he famously engineered the "forcing out" of Steve Jobs from the company - a decision he later said was due to his own inexperience in appreciating Mr Jobs' vision for future products.Traditionally, Apple has not acquired large scale companies - instead buying smaller companies with specific technologies, and folding them into the business.One recent example of this is Siri, a company Apple acquired in 2010 when it wanted to provide an integrated personal assistant on its iPhone and iPad products.Mr Sculley said that while he had "no insider knowledge" of the firm he left in 1993, he said he now wonders if it is time for Apple to change its growth strategy."Apple's never been an acquirer of big companies before, and when you look at the [Apple digital ticket system] Passbook, and fingerprint recognition - what would it mean if Apple went out and bought eBay? And they had PayPal, and integrated that?"My guess is you'd suddenly see the whole landscape of e-commerce shift."You have Amazon, which is on the fast-track to dominate every aspect of e-commerce - suddenly the game, the landscape, would change."Mr Sculley was in London ahead of the UK launch of the latest product he is working on - the Misfit Shine, a wearable device that monitors various aspects of a person's health."The future of wearable products has the potential to have a huge impact on healthcare," he said.He also, at the age of 74, offers his services as a mentor to up and coming Silicon Valley chief executives - something he said he wished he had while at Apple."When you're dealing in industries where there's such a thin line between success and failure, having another set of trusted eyes can be a real nice advantage."Mr Sculley also offered warm words for the soon-to-be-departing Microsoft boss, Steve Ballmer."Here's a man who has spent 33 years at Microsoft, loves the company," he said. "He really did not get enough credit for what he did accomplish."I can't name a CEO who didn't make some mistakes in the hi-tech industry."I think Ballmer has a lot he ought to be proud of. So he didn't get everything right - not many people do."He added: "I think it's important the CEOs do move on."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <body>Lloyds Banking Group has agreed to sell its Australian operations to Westpac Banking Corp, the country's second largest bank, for about £900m.The move is the latest in Lloyds' efforts to sell its overseas assets and focus on the UK after its £20bn government bailout in 2008.The deal, which includes assets in corporate lending and car finance, is due to be completed at the end of 2013.Westpac said the acquisition made "strategic sense".Chief executive Gail Kelly added: "These are strongly performing businesses that we know well and that will expand our reach and capability in target segments."Westpac said it did not need regulatory approvals for the deal, which is its largest since 2008.Lloyds said: "The sale is in line with the group's strategy of focusing on the UK, rationalising its international presence and ensuring best value for shareholders."The UK bank has been shedding overseas assets on a steady basis.Already this year, it has disposed of its German life insurance business, sold its international private banking arm to Swiss wealth management specialist Union Bancaire Privee, and offloaded its Spanish retail banking business to Banco Sabadell.The UK government currently holds a 33% stake in Lloyds. Last month, it sold a 6% stake in the bank for £3.2bn.Lloyds has also spun off more than 600 of its branches under the TSB brand. The new bank will be sold off next year, as part of a process ordered by the European Commission to provide greater competition.</body>

      <body>Demand from first-time house buyers is continuing to rise, according to lenders, with a 33% increase in home loans in August from a year earlier.Some 27,100 loans were advanced to those taking their first step on the property ladder in August, an increase of 7% on the previous month.The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said remortgaging levels dropped, with many on low variable interest rates.But it said low fixed rates could bring "stability" for many borrowers."[This increase] is indicative of more confidence in the market," said Paul Smee, director general of the CML."The high number of borrowers, in particular first-time buyers, opting for fixed rates reflects the attractive pricing currently on products which can provide helpful stability to borrowers for the next few years."Mortgage brokers said that August was generally a slow month for the housing market, with people concentrating on their holidays rather than house-hunting.However, this summer saw a trend of growing activity in the housing market.This was driven, in part, by the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which offers cheap funds to lenders under the condition that it is used for lending to individuals and businesses.Interest from first-time buyers is expected to continue to pick up. The first products have been offered under the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme.This is aimed at borrowers who can afford mortgage repayments, but are only able to put down a deposit of 5% of the home's value.Lenders representing more than 50% of the UK mortgage market have signed up to offering Help to Buy products by January at the latest.</body>

      <title>Latest US debt crisis talks 'useful'</title>
      <description>US Republicans and the White House say latest talks to avert a looming debt crisis were useful, but they break up without agreement.</description>

      <body>Republicans in the US House of Representatives and President Barack Obama have met amid efforts to avert a looming debt crisis.Both sides said the 90-minute discussion was useful but no decision was made. They agreed to keep talking.Republicans have offered the president a short-term debt limit increase to stave off default.A new survey suggests the majority of Americans blame the Republicans for the partial shutdown of government.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests 53% of Americans fault Republicans for the crisis, compared with 31% who say the Democrats are responsible."It was a very adult conversation," said Republican Hal Rogers of Thursday afternoon's meeting. "Both sides said they were there in good faith."House Majority leader Eric Cantor called the meeting "very useful" and said the talks were continuing.Mr Obama planned a late Friday morning White House meeting with Republican senators, who said they would present options of their own for ending the budget standoff.Officials have warned the US risks default on 17 October if the nation's $16.7 trillion (£10.5 trillion) borrowing limit is not increased.Republicans have offered to extend the government's borrowing authority beyond the deadline, temporarily putting off a default.In return they want Mr Obama to negotiate on the budget dispute that has partially closed the government - the first such shutdown for 17 years.Earlier, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said: "It's time for leadership. It's time for these negotiations and this conversation to begin."A spokesman for Mr Boehner told reporters the deal offered was a "clean" increase of the debt limit, with no additional policies attached, lasting six weeks - until 22 November.But it is not clear if Republicans are willing to drop entirely their attempts to defund or delay Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare law.Reacting to the offer, White House press secretary Jay Carney told a daily press briefing the president was glad that "cooler heads" seemed to be prevailing in the House.But he added: "He will not pay ransom in exchange for the Republicans in the House doing their job."Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the Senate would "look at anything" the House sent to them, but they would not engage in negotiations with Republicans prior to reopening the government.Rattled US stock markets rebounded on Thursday on news of a possible breakthrough.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been out of work since the shutdown began, and private firms, from arms makers to motels, have begun to lay off workers.About 15,000 private-sector employees have filed for unemployment benefits due to the shutdown, the US labour department said on Thursday.And governors in at least four western states - Utah, South Dakota, Arizona and Colorado - have asked for authority to reopen national parks within their borders because of the economic impact of the closures.On Thursday, Mr Obama signed legislation restoring death benefits to families of US troops who have died since the government closed. The shutdown prevented processing of the payments, typically made within days of the soldier's death.The president met House Democrats at the White House on Wednesday and told them he would prefer a longer-term increase to the nation's debt ceiling, but was willing to accept a short-term fix.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told a Senate hearing that skipping a payment on US debt would trigger financial crisis"chaos".Since the US hit its debt ceiling in May, the treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, Mr Lew has said.</body>

      <title>Be part of NI success story: Cameron</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron says Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.</description>

      <date>1381499978</date>
      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has said Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment.Mr Cameron was addressing a major investment conference in Belfast.He urged foreign investors to "put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story"."Some people say it's a bit undignified for a prime minster to make a sales pitch, I say nonsense," he said."I'm passionate about the power of business to create jobs and growth and I'm passionate about what Northern Ireland has to offer, and so I'm here today with a very simple message."Put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story because investing in Northern Ireland makes good business sense."Mr Cameron told the conference at Belfast's Titanic Building that Northern Ireland had put on a "great G8" during the summer."What was seen this summer was a new Northern Ireland open for business, ready for investment, strengthening the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity and determined to be defined not by divided past but by shared future," he said."With over 800 foreign investors, Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment, with almost 8,000 jobs from foreign investment in the last three years alone."Mr Cameron also visited the east Belfast factory of the aerospace company Bombardier, which said it will create at least 250 new jobs in the city over the next 12 months.On Thursday, it emerged the company hopes a future research programme will employ an additional 230 people.Speaking at Stormont Castle at the end of the conference, Mr Cameron condemned the murders of two men in Belfast and Londonderry."These murders are despicable and the people responsible should be hunted down prosecuted and convicted, they should face justice," he said.Mr Cameron said that investors believed Northern Ireland was a "safe and secure" place to do business.He said that First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness had taken risks for peace and that they would continue to take risks to ensure there was progress."They come from very different political parties, different traditions but they work together for the people of Northern Ireland," Mr Cameron added.Earlier, the first and deputy first ministers said Northern Ireland has much to offer international investors.Mr Robinson said Northern Ireland has "many of the building blocks in place" to take its economy to a "higher level".Mr McGuinness said the country had a young, educated workforce and offered a high standard of living.Mr Robinson said the key to moving Northern Ireland forward as one community was creating jobs and promoting social inclusion.He said at the heart of the Northern Ireland Executive's programme for government was the creation of a vibrant economy."The reaction we often get from potential investors who take the time to come here is that 'we didn't think that Northern Ireland had so much to offer,'" he said.Mr Robinson also joked that he hoped those attending the conference had enjoyed a traditional healthy, fat-free Northern Ireland breakfast.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness told delegates that Northern Ireland was a "very safe place to invest and to live, with very low crime levels".He said existing inward investors had been impressed with what Northern Ireland had to offer, including its "young educated workforce", excellent telecommunications infrastructure, government support and its location as a "gateway to Europe".Mr McGuinness said people in Northern Ireland had a "strong work ethic" and more than 60% of school leavers continued their studies by taking either further or higher education courses.The deputy first minister also praised the quality of life in Northern Ireland. He told investors that they would never be more than an hour's drive from either the sea or the mountains, and could enjoy first class golfing and fishing facilities.Speaking at the conference on Friday morning, Northern Ireland Economy Minister Arlene Foster said Mr Cameron had fulfilled a commitment he had made during the summer, when the prime minister hosted the G8 summit in County Fermanagh.She said he had promised in June to return to Northern Ireland to promote the role he believes it can play in the wider UK economy, and she added that the business event was part of the "economic legacy of the G8".Ms Foster said she was "very confident that there will be investment after this conference".The economy minister was asked if the murders of Kevin Kearney and Barry McCrory, who were shot dead within 48 hours in Belfast and Londonderry, had overshadowed the event.Ms Foster said: "Obviously those of us who live here are shocked and horrified that those sorts of murders can take place on our streets."However, she added: "We've been focusing on talking to the delegates about the good things in Northern Ireland - that fact that we have such good skills here, and if people invest in Northern Ireland they will definitely get value for money."The conference is the first event of its kind in Northern Ireland, since the global downturn began in 2008.</body>

      <body>The near-bankrupt Italian airline Alitalia is to receive an emergency capital injection from Italy's state-owned post office.Italy's government did not say how much Poste SpA, the Italian postal service, would be investing.The airline has said it needs to raise 455m euros (£385.2m) to stay afloat.Alitalia filed for bankruptcy in August, as high staff costs, industrial relations issues and surging oil prices further dented its finances.On Thursday the office of the Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said: "The government values Alitalia as a strategic asset for the country".Analysts estimate that Poste may inject up to 100m euros into the airline.Many have suggested that a merger with Air France-KLM is the most likely solution to Alitalia's woes.However, the French group, which owns 25% of the airline, has not yet said if it is considering that option.Alitalia went bankrupt in 2008, and was re-launched in 2009.</body>

      <body>China and the European Central Bank have signed a currency swap agreement worth 350bn yuan ($57bn; £36bn), state-owned Xinhua news agency has said.Such agreements mean the central banks can exchange currencies and firms can settle trade in local currencies rather than in US dollars.The deal is one of the largest for China as it looks to build a more international role for the yuan.It will last for three years and can be extended if both parties agree.China's currency, the yuan, is also referred to as renminbi.Foreign exchange swaps such as these mean two countries agree to swap, or borrow, each other's currency at an agreed rate.In doing so, the parties involved avoid swings in exchange rates. They can also be less reliant on the US dollar for bilateral trade and some business deals.China's central bank has now signed currency swap deals amounting to some 2.2 trillion yuan with 22 countries and regions, according to Xinhua."The new arrangement will provide more liquidity to the renminbi market in the euro area, promote overseas use of the yuan, and help facilitate trade and investment," Xinhua reported China's central bank as saying in a statement.The European Central Bank said: "The swap arrangement has been established in the context of rapidly growing bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China, as well as the need to ensure the stability of financial markets."Europe's central bank also said the deal would reassure eurozone banks of the continuous provision of Chinese yuan.</body>

      <body>Foxconn, the world's biggest contract electronics maker, has admitted student interns worked shifts at a factory in China that were in violation of its company policies.The firm, which makes products for some the world's biggest brands, has been under scrutiny for labour practices.It had admitted to hiring underage interns at the same unit last year.Foxconn said actions had been taken to bring the factory "into full compliance with our code and policies"."There have been a few instances where our policies pertaining to overtime and night shift work were not enforced," the company said in a statement.The manufacturing giant is owned by Taiwanese group Hon Hai Precision and employs about 800,000 workers around the globe.Foxconn, while not a household name in itself for many consumers, is used by most of the big technology giants around the world, including Apple, Sony, Microsoft, HP, and Nokia.It first came under scrutiny for its labour practices when 13 employees committed suicide at its Chinese plants in 2010.The incidents raised concerns over working conditions at its units in China and drew attention to growing labour strikes.For its part, Foxconn responded by raising wages, shortening working hours and employing counsellors on site.It also installed suicide nets to factory living-quarters at its Shenzhen factory.Also in 2010, Foxconn temporarily shut down a unit in India after 250 workers fell sick.And in May 2011, two people were killed after an explosion at a company plant in Chengdu.</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.Martin O'Brien from Glasgow: Thanks SSE. It turns out I can switch and save an estimated £174 per year (based on pre-increase cost), plus I'll get £100 cash back after three months for switching, and I've been paying too much on direct debit so they owe me £490. That's the most productive 10 minutes I've spent this year.John Hewitt from Nottingham: I have never been one to change suppliers but I will now. I have been a very happy SSE customer for more than 10 years and will always remember it was SSE that made it possible to get cheap electricity for a while. Yes, other suppliers will follow and raise their prices too, but initially it will be cheaper to move.Gordon Porter from Oban in Scotland: I'm not totally surprised and all other suppliers will follow suit. Gas and electricity should be run by a very light touch government for the benefit of all users and investors. Government should also have a coherent energy policy and if they require additional generating capacity should help to pay for any additions.Stephen Mcnulty from Leeds: There have been rumours around of this price rise for months, anyone that didn't fix is stupid.Brian Pritchard from Edenfield, Lancashire: I suppose all the companies will increase prices now in a similar way, so what is the point of scrapping around to save perhaps a few pence if you are lucky? It's extremely disappointing especially when the government is following the austerity path that we have seen for the last few years.Paul Sutheran from Dudley, West Midlands: This is utterly disgraceful. Our income is falling year on year, yet they raise prices approximately three times the rate of inflation. The transparency we were promised has not materialised and the costs/methods of collecting the money from the customer are impossible to fathom. Energy is a national interest at every level and should not have been put into the hands of people whose motivation is profit.Chris Jenkins from Wallasey, Merseyside: Part of my job is to help people with utilities issues in commercial and residential premises and I can tell you from first hand experience that utilities companies act disgracefully.</body>

      <body>Telecoms giant BT has signed a deal with mobile phone operator EE to use its network to provide mobile services.The deal paves the way for a return to the consumer mobile phone market for BT, which disposed of its BT Cellnet network in 2001.It will also allow it to offer mobile services alongside its existing offer of landline, internet and TV - the so-called "quad-play" market.EE operates the Orange and T-Mobile brands in the UK.EE, formerly called Everything Everywhere, is a joint venture between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.It runs the UK's biggest mobile network, including 4G services, which it pioneered in the UK in 2012.BT said the deal was a "multi-year agreement, subject to final contract". It gave no details of how much the deal was worth or exactly how long it would last.Up to now, BT has been providing corporate mobile services thanks to a tie-up with Vodafone, but that agreement has come to an end after Vodafone bought Cable and Wireless Worldwide.In August, BT expanded its TV offer by launching its own UK sports channels.</body>

      <body>Workers in the UK are less happy than those in France, Germany, the US, Canada and Australia, said a report by recruitment agency Randstad.The study estimated 9.9m British workers are unsatisfied with their jobs.Randstad said the disillusionment increased turnover and absenteeism, and could account for problems of low productivity.The survey involved 45,000 employees from 32 countries.People at the start and end of their career are the happiest, it found.In the UK, 67% of workers reported they were fulfilled, compared to 68% in France and Germany, 73% in the Netherlands, and 74% in Belgium.The trend was replicated outside of Europe, with 70% of workers in Australia reporting they were satisfied, 73% in New Zealand, 74% in the US and 77% in Canada.Mark Bull, chief executive at Randstad, said: "We are issuing a rallying call to employers to join us in action to address the state of fulfilment at work in the UK."Job satisfaction diminishes in the middle of people's careers when they are aged between 35 and 44, research found.Mr Bull said the research showed a mid-career crisis was a "very real phenomenon"."Those who are midway through their career often reflect on the professional path they have taken and where that path is leading them," he said."And this leaves many with a feeling of anxiety that they are not fulfilled in what they do and nor are they fulfilling their potential."Mr Bull advised employers to ensure they were hiring older workers as well as "passionate young people".</body>

      <title>No driving licence until 19?</title>
      <description>New research for the government suggests that young drivers shouldn't be able to qualify for a full licence until they are 19 years old.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24481574</url>
      <date>1381430020</date>
      <body>Teenagers, get ready to be outraged.Some new research put together for the government suggests that young drivers shouldn't be able to qualify for a full licence until they are 19 years old.In effect, it's proposing that 17 year olds have to spend at least a year learning how to drive before taking their test. After they pass they'll then have to spend another year on "probation", with some chunky restrictions on what they can do.For example, no driving between 22:00 and 05:00 unless you have someone over 30 years old in the car. Why? Because 30-year-olds are more sensible.It stops people filling their Vauxhall Viva with boisterous teenagers. You'll have to drive around with a green "P" plate on the car.Can you imagine police patrols trying to work out at a glance whether someone's 30 years old or not?It also suggests a ban on carrying passengers under 30 years old for all novice drivers aged under 30.Controversial stuff. Having said all that, though, there is plenty in this work by the Transport Research Laboratory that that I'm sure will be welcomed by most campaigners - and parents, frankly.Things like:- road skills being taught in schools as part of the national curriculum- letting learner drivers practise on the motorway- making learners drive for a minimum of 100 supervised hours during the day and 20 at night. They'd have to fill in a log book to show they'd done it, although I suppose that's not hard to fake, is it?Anyway, why does all this matter? Three reasons.1. Driving is one of the biggest killers of young people in Britain. They're involved in around 20% of the worst accidents yet only drive around 5% of all miles. (I had a nasty accident three days after I passed my test because I was driving like a fool).2. Some of these suggestions could happen. The government's going to consult on all this stuff soon and there could be a new law in a year or two.3. If you cut accidents amongst young people, firstly you save tragedy and heartache for thousands of families; secondly insurance premiums might even come down. So more young people can get mobile.The AA has already waded in. Its president, Edmund King, says: "There are many proposals in the report with merit and which are advocated by the AA. Road safety on the national curriculum is something we have long campaigned for and I am pleased to see it being recommended here."Likewise we would also support learner drivers being allowed on motorways with their instructor. However, at the extreme end this report could be seen as just recommending taking novice drivers off the road by regulation and restriction rather than helping them develop the right attitudes and skills to provide them with the mobility they need".The government's publishing its young drivers Green Paper this month (hopefully). Expect plenty of interesting suggestions and ideas in that.Are you a teenager? What do you think? @richardwestcott</body>

      <title>Rise in council tax court summonses</title>
      <description>Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken to court in England for non-payment of council tax as a result of the government's benefit changes, the Labour Party says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24482948</url>
      <date>1381479682</date>
      <body>Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken to court in England for non-payment of council tax owing to benefit changes, according to the Labour Party.Labour said 112 English councils had reported issuing 156,000 court summonses since April to people paying more tax as a result of the changes.That meant 450,000 individuals may have been taken to court across the whole of England in six months, it claimed.But Local Government minister Brandon Lewis said the survey was "misleading".He told the BBC there had been about three million summonses in the last year of the Labour government and the situation was now "getting much better".Labour asked all 326 billing authorities in England how many court summonses they had issued following the change to council tax benefit in April.It said the 112 authorities that responded were from a representative cross-section of councils, in terms of population density and deprivation, and extrapolating the numbers for the whole of England meant that as many as 450,000 individuals may have been taken to court since April.Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said Prime Minister David Cameron needed "to wake up to what's happening across the country"."People on the lowest income are struggling to pay his council tax rises."This is exactly what happened with the Poll Tax, as many are disabled people, veterans and carers," he said.Pete Lumb, from Hornsea, a small seaside town in the East Riding area of Yorkshire, is one of the individuals that has received a court summons.He is unemployed and has suffered with mental health problems. Living in a small bedsit, he says he has around £70 a week to live on.Since April, the council has been asking him for a few pounds a week extra towards the council tax - money he says he simply doesn't have."The chances of me getting a job are pretty much nil. I feel society just wants rid of me. I feel a complete and utter failure," he says.He's worried the next step will be bailiffs coming round.East Riding Council said that the changes to council tax benefit were "entirely the result of government policy and not anything decided by this council".It has encouraged anyone struggling to pay council tax to contact the authority at the earliest possible stage.Before April of this year, millions of people on low income in England paid no council tax at all, or had their bill substantially reduced. The council tax benefit system was then replaced.The government said this was part of a wider package of changes designed to control the spiralling cost of welfare - and encourage councils to find ways of helping those on benefits into work.It reduced the overall level of funding by 10% and said each council should decide how much support to offer residents - although pensioners were protected from any cut.Some councils managed to find savings elsewhere and absorb the funding reduction, thereby maintaining the level of support for low-income households. The benefit cuts were not passed on in Scotland or Wales.The majority of authorities in England, however, said they had no option but to ask some of the poorest residents for money. Many had never paid council tax before.Often, these residents have been asked for just a few pounds a week extra. But that can add up to hundreds of pounds a year.Already there have been reports of queues forming outside magistrates courts on certain days of the week, as the number of cases of non-payment increases.The Citizens Advice Bureau in Hull said it dealt with 1,000 cases last August, but by this August the number had risen to 3,000.But Mr Lewis said Labour's survey was "shoddy" and that official statistics "show arrears have fallen, and the amount of council tax collected has increased"."It is nothing like a full survey of the country," he told BBC Radio 5Live."I think it is really bad that the Labour Party just want to use something like this to scaremonger and to make political points in what is a really serious issue about dealing with our welfare problems."Mr Lewis said a £100m hardship fund had been made available to councils to support people struggling to pay their council tax, on top of the funding already given to local government."There is no interest for a council to get in a situation where people can't pay and they should be working with people...to ensure that they can protect the most vulnerable," he added."They don't need to be increasing the charges on people."The government does not have its own figures for the number of court summonses since April.Officials emphasise that every year there are a high number of court summonses for non-payment of council tax.Labour said it had asked councils for specific numbers of cases as a result of the changes to council tax benefit, so the total in its survey represents the extra number of summonses - those people who haven't paid council tax until now, or have been asked to pay more since April.</body>

      <title>Equitable payment deadline extended</title>
      <description>A deadline for savers who lost money in the Equitable Life scandal to claim compensation has been extended to the middle of 2015.</description>

      <body>A deadline for savers who lost money in the Equitable Life scandal to claim compensation has been extended to the middle of 2015.The planned cut-off of March 2014 was criticised as "arbitrary" in a report by a committee of MPs in October.The insurance company came close to collapse in 2000, in one of the UK's biggest financial scandals.The Treasury said that up to 400,000 savers who lost money had still not received compensation payments.A national advertising campaign to encourage eligible policyholders to come forward will be launched in the next few weeks.After years of official inquiries into the scandal, the government agreed to a compensation system in 2010, with the first payments being made by June 2011.But the report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee, published in October, said that one in five policyholders might not be traced before the March 2014 deadline.It criticised the lack of publicity to reduce the number of people who might miss out, and suggested not enough preparatory work had been done ahead of the compensation scheme starting. Only £168m was paid out by March 2012, rather than the expected £500m.Now the government has decided to extend the deadline to try to locate thousands of savers whose addresses are unrecorded."We have made strong progress, but we want to maximise the number of people who will eventually receive payments, which is why we are extending the Equitable Life payment scheme to mid-2015," said Sajid Javid, Financial Secretary to the Treasury.Paul Weir, spokesman for the Equitable Members' Action group (Emag), said: "We are delighted that the Treasury has listened."It is vital that the Treasury complete the task of tracing those who are entitled to compensation and we will be working with them to assist that process."</body>

      <title>Power to raise rail fares curbed</title>

      <date>1381315063</date>
      <body>The rail industry's power to increase fares in England is to be curbed as part of a government drive to overhaul the rail fare system.Until now, some regulated fares could potentially have gone up by 9.1% next January.They will now be capped at 6.1%.But campaigners say it is not enough, and point out that commuters will still have to pay an above- inflation increase next year.Regulated fares are those which the government controls, and include season tickets, "anytime" single tickets around major cities, and off-peak inter-city return tickets.They will go up in 2014 by an average of 4.1%, a number calculated using an average of inflation - as measured by the retail prices index (RPI) for July - plus 1%.Train companies can add up to 5% on top of the average rise, although fares that go up by more than the average must be balanced by others that rise by less or fall.The government plans to limit that extra increase to 2% in the future. But the provision for the average regulated ticket price to go up by 1% more than inflation remains.The move is part of the government's Fares and Ticketing review being published by the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin.Mr McLoughlin told the BBC he thought rail users would get "quite a lot of benefit" from the cap.He said: "Commuters will benefit from knowing there is a strict limit on the amount rail companies can put up the cost. People had been seeing 10% rises."Those commuters who wanted to see more capacity on trains welcomed the government's investment into stations such as London Bridge, he said.Mr McLoughlin added: "If we didn't take action, people would complain that we are not taking action. We are taking action, we are investing in the railways, we are trying to keep the price down as much as we can."He said he was "always looking" at how to reduce the pressure on the passenger.The government will also detail a pilot scheme that could see all long-distance rail tickets sold on a single-leg basis, not as returns.It says this could allow passengers to more easily "mix and match" different ticket types when planning a return journey.Other plans to be revealed by the Transport Secretary include:Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said the new cap on fares would be "cold comfort for commuters"."It has taken 18 months, delivers fare increases of up to 6% and is too little too late," she said."This announcement doesn't go as far as Labour's plans which would prevent train companies from increasing fares beyond one per cent above inflation."</body>

      <description>Asian stock markets rise on hopes the US will reach a deal on raising its debt ceiling, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street.</description>

      <body>Asian stock markets have risen on hopes the US will reach a deal on raising its debt ceiling, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street.This was after US Republicans offered President Obama a short-term increase in the debt limit to stave off default.Stock indexes in Japan, Australia, China and Hong Kong all gained.There have been concerns that a failure to agree a deal to raise the limit may see the US default on its payments and hurt the global economy.Analysts said the offer by the Republicans had raised hopes that such a scenario was likely to be avoided."What this is, is opening the door to discussion and negotiation when before we had two sides just finger pointing," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC."We don't know if in six weeks we'll be in the same place, but at least this opens the possibility [of a deal]", he said.Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.2%, Australia's ASX 200 added 1.6% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.2%.On Thursday, the US markets had their best day since January 2013, buoyed by the proposal. The Dow Jones, SandP 500, and Nasdaq indexes all closed up by more than 2%.The US needs to agree on raising the nation's $16.69 trillion (£10.47tn) debt ceiling by 17 October.A failure to do so could see the US government default, as it runs out of money to pay its bills and service its national debt.Analysts have said such a scenario was likely to have a serious impact on global economic growth."It would mean higher interest rates for everybody across the world," Geoffrey Lunt from the banking group HSBC told the BBC. "This is a very serious situation.""I think the US Congress needs to be aware that the repercussions go way beyond the borders of the United States," he added.In the past few days, before Thursday's recovery, the impasse over the debt limit had hit markets and increased the interest rate for one-month US Treasury bills.The International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has also warned that failure by Washington to raise the federal debt ceiling would wreak serious damage on the US and global economies.The offer by the Republicans comes as the US government continues to remain in a partial shutdownHouse of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said the offer was in exchange for negotiations with the White House to end the shutdown that began on 1 October after Congress failed to agree on a new budget.Mr Boehner told reporters on Thursday: "What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling in agreement to go to conference on the budget for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government."The government has closed non-essential operations due to the shutdown.Goldman Sachs has estimated that if the shutdown were to extend into a third week, it could shave as much as 0.9% from US GDP growth this quarter.Crucially, markets have been left in the dark about the current state of the US economy, as the agencies responsible for closely watched data like the jobs figures and inflation have been closed during the shutdown.On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase sold the US government debt in its portfolio that might be exposed to default in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.</body>

      <description>China overtakes the US to become the biggest importer of oil in the world, US government data shows.</description>

      <body>China has knocked the US from its top spot as the world's biggest net importer of oil, US government data shows.The country's fast-growing economy, as well as the rise in car sales, has led to its new status, according to September's data.Oil consumption in China had outstripped production by 6.3 million barrels a day, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA).In the US, the figure was 6.1 million.China's own oil supply has been outstripped by its economic boom, and its oil fields have been damaged by flooding during the past few months.The country had had to import to make up the shortfall, said the EIA.It predicts the trend will continue into 2014.The US uses 18.6 million barrels of oil per day compared with China's 10.9 million, despite having a population a third the size of China's.But the US is increasingly able to support itself after the growth of its domestic hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - a new technique of drilling for gas and oil from shale rock.It has attracted controversy from environmental campaigners concerned about the large quantities of water used and the potential danger of carcinogenic chemicals. The campaigners say the chemicals could escape and contaminate groundwater.Jason Gammel, head of European oil and gas research at Macquarie, said he expected the trend to last for the next five years.He said he expected America to produce 20-22 million barrels of oil per day by 2022.Mr Gammel said: "The US has moved very quickly to utilise fracking and horizontal drilling activities."But he said such an approach would be difficult for China to mimic, as the US was already well prepared to take advantage of the new techniques, for example with its large oil field services.</body>

      <title>UK interest rates held at 0.5%</title>

      <date>1381404300</date>
      <body>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has again voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%.It has kept the key borrowing rate at that level since March 2009.The MPC also said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that before interest rates can rise, the unemployment rate needs to fall below 7%.That stipulation is part of Mr Carney's policy of giving forward guidance.The idea is to create more certainty for businesses and individuals about the course of interest rates, which may encourage borrowing and investment.He has forecast that it will take about three years for unemployment to reach his target.However, there has been speculation that rates may start to go up sooner, given recent indications of healthier prospects for the UK economy.On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund lifted its UK growth projection for this year from 0.9% to 1.4%."The bar for any more QE now looks to be very high," said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight."It will likely only occur if the economy loses substantial momentum over the coming months, or if there is major financial turmoil and a sharp upward move in market interest rates when the US Federal Reserve finally starts to taper."Our central scenario is that neither of these events will happen, but neither can be ruled out."David Tinsley of BNP Paribas said the decision came as no surprise."Overall, UK monetary policy settings for now are on auto-pilot, barring the US debt ceiling debate getting very messy," he said."Even on an optimistic basis, the UK labour market is not going to deliver an unemployment rate at 7% for six to 12 months at the very earliest, while inflationary pressures are under control."And the Bank has made fairly clear that while it is monitoring house price developments, it is not about to adjust monetary policy in response to those."So for now, forward guidance is delivering the sort of boring certainty the new governor was after."</body>

      <title>How useful are MBAs to a new company?</title>
      <description>For many would-be entrepreneurs, getting a Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification is seen as essential. But is that really the case?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24335894</url>
      <date>1381359725</date>
      <body>For many would-be entrepreneurs, getting a Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification is seen as essential.Yet with the most prestigious MBA courses in the US costing more than $100,000 (£62,000) in tuition fees alone, they don't come come cheaply.But does the celebrated qualification, and its teaching of a wide range of business skills, give its holders a big advantage when they set up their first firms?Or would people be better off if they instead simply went straight to setting up in business and learning on the job?Eoin Bara, owner of Dublin-based design agency V7, was pleased to be able to call on the assistance of someone with an MBA.Back in 2012, the company was facing a problem - it was growing too fast.With big clients including Intel and Goldman Sachs, V7 went from two to 12 employees in six months.Mr Bara says he didn't know how to manage this growth.So he decided to ask an MBA-qualified management consultant to come in and take an objective look at the company, and guide them on what they needed to do next.The MBA was able to show where the company was making losses, how they could make better use of their time, and how to plan for the future."We got more clarity on the day-to-day, which allowed us to focus on the future," says Mr Bara. "We didn't use to focus on the future at all."While author and journalist Philip Delves Broughton acknowledges the benefits of an MBA, he also thinks the cost can be a serious impediment.Mr Broughton wrote the book Ahead of the Curve, which outlines his experience on the MBA programme at Harvard Business School."One of the worst things you can do as an entrepreneur, starting young and getting going, is saddle yourself with a load of debt," he says."That's a disaster, because it really hobbles you," he adds, referring to tuition fees of more than $55,000 (£34,000) per year for his two-year programme at Harvard.The high cost of an MBA was a major reason why American tech entrepreneur Brenden Mulligan dropped out of his course at Northwestern University in Illinois.Mr Mulligan is the co-founder of Cluster, a mobile phone app which enables people to share photo albums.He calculates that he was spending $150 (£90) per hour on the MBA, and does not think it was worth it. He left roughly halfway through the course having spent around $45,000 (£28,000)."I just didn't get much of a return to investment on that money compared to other ways I've spent money supporting myself being an entrepreneur," explains Mr Mulligan, who is now based in San Francisco.He suggests budding tech entrepreneurs actually get experience in their field by joining or doing an internship at a small start-up first, rather than sign up for an MBA course.By contrast, London-based business investor Reshma Sohoni is firmly in the pro-MBA camp.Ms Sohoni, co-founder of technology start-up investment fund Seedcamp, says that if a new business is to do well, having someone on board with an MBA is crucial."Any organisation that's really gotten anywhere has MBA talent," says Ms Sohoni, who has an MBA herself.Ms Sohoni finds that from her experience, people with MBAs have a better sense of how to make a business more commercial, and have a much better understanding of running a business in general.It is something that some other entrepreneurs with MBAs agree with, including Andrew Carroll, who co-founded the e-receipts company Paperless Receipts.Having completed his MBA at the Cass Business School in London, Mr Carroll, 34, says he has a good understanding of a broad range of business concepts."I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now without having it, because it gives you a lot of knowledge about everything," he says."So I can now sit happily in a meeting with a hedge fund manager or with a marketing director or a finance director. I may not know everything they talk about but I'll know most of it."For entrepreneur Tobias van Amstel, 29, experience is more than important than having an MBA.The Dutchman is based in London, where he co-founded Signkick, an online booking platform for advertising on billboards."I would advise everybody just to get started and fail at your first company and learn as much as you can and then start your second company," he says."That was actually the best education I could think of to start Signkick," he says of his first business, a hotel booking website."The things I learnt there were so much more valuable than what any education could have taught me."But despite much encouragement for young people with ideas to just start their own enterprises, American entrepreneur and seed investor Alex Hoye, 44, is sceptical.He spent several years working at Disney and McKinsey before doing an MBA at Harvard in the early 1990s, and is now based in London."I think there's a huge value to not learning everything the hard way," he suggests.Mr Hoye believes prior experience is hugely important for entrepreneurs, and this can be gained either through work or through an MBA programme."I'm against the popular notion that one should just get out and do it," he says. "I disagree. I think you can learn a lot of the hard knocks by working with pros, or getting an MBA."He thinks the practice of going over case studies during an MBA is especially helpful in recognising patterns and successful business practices.But despite these useful skills, Mr Hoye does question the high cost."To be honest, there's a very good chance I would give it a miss if I were 26 now," he says.</body>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Cindy Sui hears from Yen Tseng, a Taiwanese Canadian who, with his elder brother, founded a travel business called iBeengo. It takes tourists off the beaten track and helps them experience Taiwan the local way.Yen Tseng got the idea to start a travel business about a year ago because he loved to travel. He was born in Taiwan and attended middle school there, but went to Canada for his early, secondary and university education. By the age of 25, he had travelled to 25 countries.But starting this business in Taiwan wasn't an easy decision for him and his brother Ronnie, 30. Both are highly educated and their family had expectations of them. "The biggest risk is still the fact that we didn't take the nine-to-five job and we didn't take a stable salary."Initially, Yen and his brother wanted to help people take the pain out of travelling - so with a loan of one million New Taiwan dollars ($34,000; £21,000) from their parents, they created iBeengo in September 2012. It allows travellers to pick and choose the itinerary they want and create custom-made tours.Most of their clients are Chinese independent student travellers curious about Taiwan who see visiting the island as a lifelong dream. Many are women because they like to get out there and explore, but also want the safety of being in a tour with a local guide, Yen says.What makes iBeengo's tours different from those of big travel agencies is that they allow travellers to sleep in if they want, skip parts of the tour and rejoin the group later, take their time at each location, and request locations off the itinerary."People don't actually like bus tours. Bus tours are like food on a flight, there's no choice. What we do is buffet style; you come here, pick out what you want, and go at the pace you like," said Yen.Some of the places iBeengo takes tourists to are popular scenic attractions, and they also offer free walking tours for interested tourists.Wearing their eye-catching bright green iBeengo t-shirts, Yen, his brother, and college-student volunteers point out locally known trivia, such as the stall that sells the best Taiwanese fried chicken patty at a night market, the locations where popular Taiwanese films were shot, or the childhood hangout of a Taiwanese pop singer.In its first year, iBeengo has taken 400 tourists around Taiwan. Yen says they try to keep their average tour size to fewer than 15 people and aim for an ideal ratio of one tour guide to five tourists, much less than the traditional ratio of one guide to 30 travellers.What makes starting up a business relatively low cost for Yen is that he and Ronnie hooked up with a start-up incubator which rents office space to young companies cheaply. They pay only NT$3,000 per person per month.Advertising in person also helps them cut costs. They fly to China to drop off brochures at universities and advertise on Chinese websites to reach out to their target customers - young Chinese people.IBeengo for the moment is mainly a travel exchange programme for students, but the brothers are hoping to raise the US$200,000 (£125,000) to register their company as a fully functioning tourism business for all.In the future the brothers plan to operate tours around Japan and further afield. But for now, they are enjoying helping tourists from mainland China - Taiwan's former rivals during the war decades ago - get to know the island and see not only its scenic beauty but unique character."Just the fact that our customers are going home and telling their friends about us and their friends are coming to us asking us to organise tours for them, that gives us a lot of satisfaction," Yen said.</body>

      <title>Turning around the world's oldest travel firm</title>
      <description>A profile of Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, and how she is trying to turnaround the fortunes of Thomas Cook.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24328944</url>
      <date>1381152216</date>
      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.Meanwhile, on Monday, 7 October the company announced the sale of two businesses in Egypt and Lebanon. The two units in question - Thomas Cook Egypt and Thomas Cook Lebanon - offer outbound travel to Egyptian and Lebanese customers.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>Debt-free Norwich have 'rosy future'</title>
      <description>Norwich City chairman Alan Bowkett says the club can now manage its own destiny after becoming free of external debt.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24466994</url>
      <date>1381383804</date>
      <body>Norwich City chairman Alan Bowkett says the club now has the freedom to manage its own destiny after becoming free of external debt.The club had loans amounting to £23m four years ago, but now only owes interest-free money to directors."I'd postulate there are few clubs in the Premier League who can say that," Bowkett told BBC Sport."We're on a sound financial footing. In my view we have our best team for 20 years. The future is looking rosy."He added: "In terms of the football club going forward it gives us complete freedom to manage our own destiny."Following relegation to League One in 2009, the Canaries were in a desperate financial position, struggling to meet the payments on the £23m worth of debt.But the arrival of Bowkett as chairman and David McNally as chief executive, coupled with back-to-back promotions to the Premier League and restructuring of the club's loans, has seen a stark turnaround in fortunes.City finished the 2012-13 financial year with £900,000 of external debt, £700,000 of which was tied up in preferred shares, while the remaining £200,000 was paid off weeks after the accounting period."Four years ago when we were looking at lots of debt and League One football, we put in a plan to turn the business around and I'm happy to report we're on track," said McNally."To do it in four years, some would have perhaps seen as far-fetched back in 2009."They were difficult days. We are now institutionally debt free. We can now generate as much cash as possible and put that into the football team. Comparing then and now is like night and day."Norwich's after-tax profit for 2012-13 was just £500,000, down from £13.5m in the previous 12 months, but the club has moved its financial year from May to June, meaning the newest accounts cover a 13-month period.Meanwhile, there was £19.7m of player investment in the last financial year, up from £10.4m, and increase in spending made possible by successfully retaining their Premier League place for a third successive season, and the £49.03m received for television rights.The latter figure will rise to somewhere between £62m and £64m for this season, with an extra £1.25m for every position above 20th the club finishes."As long as we're alive, we have to stay in the Premier League," said McNally."It's a message I need to get across to all of my colleagues here at the football club. The board knows it, but everybody who works here needs to be focused on that."It's why the finances have improved so quickly and it's integral to our future plans."Despite their healthy financial position, proposals to expand Carrow Road have been deferred.The Canaries regularly sell out their 27,000-capacity stadium and had considered rebuilding the City Stand to increase that to 32,000.However, that would require a 20-year, £30m mortgage and losing up to 6,000 seats for an entire season, so the project has now become a long-term idea."It's on the agenda, but the first thing we want to invest in is the software - staff and academy - to secure our position in the Premier League," Bowkett added.</body>

      <title>Hot Spot 'dropped for Ashes series'</title>
      <description>Hot Spot will not be used in the Ashes series down under, according to the inventor of the infrared camera technology.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24465269</url>
      <date>1381392333</date>
      <body>Hot Spot will not be used in this winter's Ashes series in Australia, says the inventor of the infrared camera technology used to detect edges.Host broadcaster Channel Nine chose to drop the controversial system after concerns over its cost and reliability."It's their decision and that's what has been communicated to us," Warren Brennan told the Sydney Morning Herald. The International Cricket Council said it was a matter for Channel Nine and Cricket Australia to resolve.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is aware of the reports and is considering its response. The governing body was not contacted in advance of the decision.England coach Andy Flower and captain Alastair Cook have consistently backed the use of technology in the decision review system (DRS) and expressed a desire to improve it, rather than dispense of any of its components.The absence of Hot Spot means television umpires will be restricted to using Eagle Eye ball-tracking software, audio from stump microphones, and slow-motion replays when England or Australia review an umpire's decision during the Ashes, which begins on 21 November in Brisbane.Hot Spot was devised in 2007 by BBG Sports and works using heat sensors and infrared cameras to determine what the ball has made contact with.But it came under scrutiny during England's 3-0 Ashes victory over the summer when several faint edges appeared to go undetected, with Brennan claiming that the protective tape on players' bats was diminishing the effectiveness of his system.The host broadcaster and the governing body finance the cost of using Hot Spot, which is almost £6,000 per day according to Cricinfo.Brennan told BBC Sport that Australia television had decided not to pay for the system after an increase in television rights costs.He said: "Unfortunately, with Channel Nine paying double the amount in rights fees to Cricket Australia for their new broadcast agreement, then there was always going to be less funds available in the kitty for development of technology."Instead, BBG approached Cricket Australia to request that they also contribute to Hot Spot costs - in addition to Channel Nine's input. Unfortunately, Cricket Australia refused to engage with BBG in any shape or form apart from an initial phone call saying that this was a Channel Nine and ICC matter."This disappointed BBG greatly as the cricket boards in England, New Zealand and South Africa all contribute to Hot Spot costs in addition to the local broadcasters."BBG completely accepts and understands Channel Nine's decision in regard to this matter. Conversely BBG finds it difficult to understand Cricket Australia's stance on the matter."Brennan added that his company are continuing to develop the product.He said: "The critical point in regard to this matter from BBG's perspective is to continue to undertake research and development to improve the Hot Spot product."What I learned out of the UK this year is that the system needs to be improved continually."There's new technology coming out all the time. And as we can see from everyday instances - from our mobile phones - things improve dramatically month by month, year by year."A Cricket Australia spokesman was quoted as saying: "We don't think it's appropriate to comment on discussions between Nine and one of its partners."</body>

      <title>US eyes World Cup hosting chance</title>
      <description>The US Soccer Federation says it would like to host the World Cup again, but is not seeking compensation over the controversy surrounding the 2022 event.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24464440</url>
      <date>1381322410</date>
      <body>The United States Soccer Federation (USSF) says it would be interested in hosting the World Cup football tournament again.The country last held the event in 1994, in front of sell-out crowds. Since then, the team reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002.The US, a regular qualifier for the tournament, recently went through to the 2014 competition in Brazil.It was one of the losing bidders for the 2022 World Cup.The others were South Korea, Japan and Australia."We would be interested in hosting it again - the next one that would be available is 2026," said Sunil Gulati, president of the USSF and a member of Fifa's executive committee.But following the furore surrounding the way in which the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were awarded, he admitted that "the bidding process needs to improve".Mr Gulati said the US would not be following Australia in seeking compensation over any move by Fifa to move that 2022 event - to be held in Qatar - to the winter.Australian FA chairman Frank Lowy has said Fifa should provide "just and fair" compensation to losing bidders if the World Cup is moved from the summer."We have not discussed it," Mr Gulati said at the Leaders in Football conference in London."It was a difficult decision, a controversial decision [by Fifa], " he added.He said one of the weaknesses of the US bid might have been that it had hosted the event as recently as 1994, but a strength was that it had all necessary stadiums already in place to host a World Cup.The Australian football association, the FFA, spent A$43m (£25m) on its dual bid to host either the 2018 or 2022 World Cups, with most of the cash provided by the government.But Fifa has indicated there is little chance of Australia being awarded compensation.On any proposed 2022 move to winter, Mr Gulati said it would "be nonsense to rush" a decision.Turning to the US again, he said that should the World Cup be moved to January or February, then Fifa would have to engage in discussions with American TV broadcasters.In the first two months of the year, the NFL American Football season comes to a climax, providing a ratings winner for the US networks.Mr Gulati said there would need to be "a thoroughly vetted study" looking at all existing commercial contracts around the 2022 event, including those between Fifa and US broadcasters.And he said there was no chance of Fifa asking the NFL to move its season to fit in with the football World Cup.</body>

      <title>Do sweat the small stuff</title>
      <description>Why focusing on small details matters to big firms</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24344341</url>
      <date>1381446536</date>
      <body>Jan Smits is standing in his hotel room staring at his watch and he's not very happy.But Mr Smits is no ordinary guest. He's the Asia, Middle East and Africa chief executive of International Hotels Group (IHG), the world's largest hotel chain.On a trip to India to see how young graduates are trained within the company he has just realised that the time taken to prepare the hotel rooms for bedtime - the so-called turndown service - is not standardised.At the Crowne Plaza New Delhi Rohini the process of turning down the duvet cover and closing the curtains took five minutes, but it should only take two minutes.It seems surprising that someone so senior, a member of the firm's executive committee, is concerned about this kind of small detail which one would assume would fall squarely under the remit of housekeeping.But for IHG, like all businesses, time equals money. If a regular process such as this takes longer than it should, then repeated 678,000 times for each of its rooms worldwide, the extra time spent would be significant and ultimately costly.But it's not only crucial for financial reasons, but so that a guest, whether they are staying at a Crowne Plaza in India or America, has the same experience each time.Mr Smits says IHG uses so-called "standard operating procedures" to ensure this level of standardisation. These outline every single step involved in any regular process, such as a turndown or checking a guest into the hotel, to ensure it is both efficient and consistently creates the same end result."From my experience here tonight there's just a little bit more room to make sure it's exactly the same across all the Crowne Plazas. We're very close but it can't be very close. it needs to be the same each time to create a great brand," he says.While it may appear obsessive, experts argue paying attention to these kinds of details is not only important, but is a crucial part of a firm's success, particularly customer-facing ones.That's because creating a standard and consistent experience can be a good way of making customers loyal to a particular brand."Ultimately it drives customer loyalty and repeat business. As long as it's an enjoyable experience people tend to go to what they know even when they're in another country," says Bridget McVerry, a principal at management consultancy Oliver Wyman where she focuses on the retail sector.She points to fast food chain McDonald's as an example. "You know what you're going to get and not just from a product point of view, but from the overall experience," she says.Recent research by Oliver Wyman in the US found that differences in customer experience were the reason behind one quarter to one third of the variation in sales and profits of individual shops within a chain. Improving the consistency of the customer experience drove sales improvements of 10% or more.And it's not just a good way of creating loyal customers, it can help create loyal employees: retail chains which focused on providing a consistent customer experience - where employees knew what they were supposed to do and were given the training and tools to do it - had staff turnover rates 50% or more below industry norms.Given the very real difference the research shows that focusing on the customer experience can have, Ms McVerry believes that it's something chief executives should be involved with, at least initially in terms of defining what she calls their "mantra'"- the experience that the business wants to deliver to its customers.Of course, the more branches a firm has the harder it can be to ensure customers have the same experience each time they visit.Coffee chain Starbucks has more than 19,000 stores worldwide, including 730 in the UK, and while Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing at Starbucks UK, admits that being consistent can be hard, he says customer feedback indicates it is important."One of the things they value most about Starbucks is the friendly, personal service and the consistent high quality coffee. They are just not willing to take a risk on a poor experience or product when they have just a few moments on their morning commute or school run," he tells the BBC.To ensure that customers' experiences are the same, whether they order their coffee in London or Manchester, Mr Cranna says all new Starbucks staff are trained in its cultures and values before they are let anywhere near a coffee machine. These cultures and values - which include making the coffee shops a "third place" for customers away from home and work - are the same in each of the 60 countries in which it operates."The culture and values are fundamentally important, with straightforward functional training alone it would be very hard to maintain the high quality consistent experience we strive to offer," he says.As IHG's Mr Smits says: "The devil is in the detail. You have to be very disciplined and empower your leaders to make it happen."Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <title>Juventus executive Agnelli oversees club's revival</title>
      <description>Seeking to revive Italian football's Old Lady</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24479706</url>

      <body>Few football executives have been asked to take the reins of a global brand shortly after a corruption scandal, while also following in the footsteps of a trio of family members.But that is what happened to Andrea Agnelli, president of Italian giants Juventus, current champions of Italy and third in Serie A at present.Agnelli, who studied at Oxford, is an experienced businessman having worked at Ferrari and Philip Morris, and is currently on the Fiat board.In 2010, he became the latest member of the Agnelli dynasty - after his father, uncle, and grandfather - to take over the running of the club.Since then he has overseen the move to a new stadium - the 41,000-capacity Juventus Stadium - as well as transforming its finances in the midst of the eurozone crisis, and also winning two league titles."We all know the challenges of running a professional sports franchise, it is a complex matter," he says with understatement."At the end of the day it is all about the results on the pitch - that can then create a virtuous, not vicious, cycle for the company."But - as so many sports around the world discover - the move to a new, modern, playing arena, can also be a catalyst for success."It has been great," he says of the new stadium, pointing out that Juventus has "moved house a few times" in the past 25 years."We had to renew our stadium, in order to put on the best show," says Agnelli, speaking at the Leaders in Football conference."We are now practically sold out all the time," he adds, compared with the average crowds of 20,000 at the club's previous permanent home, the Stadio Delle Alpi.Stadium revenues since the move have tripled, from 13m euros ($17m; £11m) a season, to 40m euros.The Juventus Stadium is the only club-owned stadium in Serie A, includes the club museum, and will host the 2014 Europa League final.Agnelli says the average price for a single ticket is 35 euros, and laments the fact that Juventus brings in roughly half the ticketing revenues of Chelsea, a club with a stadium of similar capacity.He points out that the club is constrained in raising its prices because of the Italian economic situation, and the fact that its major competitors - playing in older stadiums - have lower prices.Juventus is in many ways the Manchester United of Italy, with millions of fans across the country and overseas, and like the English club has won the most championships in its own country.Last week the club announced its financial results, for the year to 30 June 2013, which revealed record revenues in the 2012-13 season.He says that when he took over in 2010 he had twin goals - to "achieve financial sustainability and go back to being competitive on the field".The club has also reduced its losses by 80% in two financial years, but Agnelli believes there is "still some way to go... particularly with regards to diversifying and stabilising our income".The 37-year-old is aware that in an era of sports globalisation top brands such as Juventus are always looking to boost their appeal abroad."If you want to get your brand internationally known, you have to be participating in the Champions League," he says.He says such participation must "not be seen simply as a seasonal target, but rather a recurring intermediate aim of a broader mid- to long-term strategy," which will help carry the Juve name into new global markets.Agnelli believes the club can use digital media to help exploit this existing - and potential - fan base outside of Italy, and bring the club closer to them "on a daily basis".On the broader national club picture, Agnelli has worries about the current economic strength of Italian football as a whole, compared with rival European leagues in England, Spain, Germany, and increasingly France."We used to be a destination for the top players in the world, now we are a country of transition for top players moving to other leagues," he says, pointing to how AC Milan was unable to stop Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic moving to Paris Saint-Germain in France.He says Italian clubs' current financial health is largely in the hands of two "intermediaries".These are the TV companies, which provide a large bulk of Serie A clubs' revenues, and players, who can boost income through success on the playing field."We have some of the top clubs in European competitions, but we want to make sure that the whole [Serie A] economic system grows," he says.Top of his list are new stadiums for clubs, so that Italian clubs can match their counterparts in places like England and Germany, who are bringing in more fans and revenues from their arenas.The club has won a total of 29 titles, the last two under Agnelli's reign.The total would be higher but Juventus was stripped of two titles and relegated to the second tier, Serie B, in 2006 after being involved in the Calciopoli scandal, in which the club was accused of rigging matches by influencing officials into selecting referees sympathetic to Juventus.However, having now transformed its fortunes Agnelli is hoping to witness the first Juventus side since the 1930s to win three championships in a row.But there can be little doubt, with the playing strength of a plethora of top Italian sides, that the current Juventus team faces a stiffer challenge."We can debate whether there were the same difficulties then that we face today," he says."We also have European football competition to contend with now too."</body>

      <body>Funsho Lawal beams as she strides towards the Jumia delivery van parked outside her house in Surulere, a Lagos neighbourhood.The delight on her face soon fades as she struggles to fit into the bright red high heels she had ordered."This was the last pair. They only had them in this size," she complains.Funsho's expression changes again as she scrolls through her smartphone to find another pair of shoes on the Jumia website."This is the best, the very best way to shop," she says."I don't have to go out to the shop because they deliver right here to my house."Ten miles of traffic-congested roads away, in a huge warehouse, dozens of shelves stand stacked with a wide variety of products - from electronics to kitchen utensils.This 90,000-sq-ft (8,360-sq-m) building is the headquarters of Jumia, a company started just over a year ago.Now it is one of Nigeria's largest online retailers, with 500 workers and 150 delivery vehicles nationwide.The company's Harvard-educated co-founder Raphael Afaedor is bullish about the current growth."Every one of Nigeria's 36 states has had a Jumia parcel delivered there, so we're moving gradually to reach every Nigerian with organised retail," Mr Afaedor says.Jumia faces strong competition from Konga and Dealdey - similar retail websites also experiencing rapid growth.This rivalry presents options for Nigerian shoppers looking for home-grown answers to Amazon - which as yet has no dedicated retail presence on the continent - or eBay.Folake Adeniji, another online shopper, says: "For a long time I had to rely on people going abroad to come back with clothes and household items."Even if I found the items in shops they were always overpriced, so these shopping websites are like a breath of fresh air."Other avenues have opened in Nigeria's internet space, with companies offering services in food and drink, real estate, travel and mobile money transfer, among others.Mark Essien, a software developer, runs Hotels.ng - a website offering listings and reviews for more than 4,500 hotels in Nigeria.It is difficult to find a current database of phone numbers for hotels around the country - many of which do not have websites.This presents an opportunity for companies such as Mr Essien's, which has 40 employees, including some who have to physically visit hotels around the country to get them listed.The five-month-old company is confident that demand for its services will grow.Mr Essien says: "A lot of people are sceptical about companies like ours, but at the same time there is a lot of demand."We have people using our services. We have not started customer marketing yet, but every week we have close to 1,000 bookings."Mr Essien credits much of this initial success to another company, Spark.ng, which provided funding and mentorship that allowed Hotels.ng to grow as aggressively as it has.Spark has a fund of $1m (£616,000) to offer local internet start-ups. It is led by, among others, Jason Njoku, an internet entrepreneur who runs several online platforms, including IrokoTV, the largest distributor of Nigerian films.Meanwhile, Jumia received investment from Rocket Internet, a German online incubator which has now replicated the site in Kenya.While the companies are not willing to divulge the financial details of these partnerships, some observers believe the current period is a healthy one in Nigeria's e-commerce industry.For many years, any mention of Nigeria and the internet was met with scepticism because of worries about cybercrime.This has made it hard for local companies to gain the trust of the public, both abroad and within the country, although they are making attempts to overcome this."There are definitely technological challenges in Nigeria that are not faced in other countries," Mr Essien says."Payment systems are very manual - cards don't work very well. A lot of our customers prefer paying by bank deposits."The logistics network is very poor across Nigeria but a lot of these problems also represent opportunities that people can solve and create big companies out of," he adds.Customers can pay for their goods on delivery, in cash or by card, eliminating the fear of online fraud."It is interesting the amount of investment these companies are spending on advertising on television and on billboards," says Loy Okezie, a technology news blogger."The retail sites are booming and we can now compare them to other sites in the rest of the continent and India."Mr Okezie adds that much of the activity picked up in 2012 and the online supermarkets are currently more popular because they cater to immediate needs.According to the Nigeria Communications Commission, in June 2013 the country had 48.1 million active internet subscriptions through mobile phone networks.This presents a huge market for online trade - and one that local start-ups are keen to exploit.</body>

      <title>The UK housing market - in graphics</title>
      <description>Figures show the story of the UK housing market</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24387237</url>

      <body>The UK's housing boom ended in 2008 as the banking crisis and credit crunch bit.In the subsequent years, sales and prices fell in most areas, leaving some people in negative equity. Many potential buyers found they were unable to get on to the ladder as risk-averse banks rationed their lending.But 2013 has seen hints of a revival in the housing market, driven in part by signs of the return of first-time buyers.Transactions have risen but the number of homes for sale has failed to match demand in many areas, pushing up prices.Annual increases are now at a level not seen for at least three years.This is an average across the UK, and might not reflect the fact that prices and activity are growing in some major cities - most notably London - but are still falling in some areas.Increasing prices create a fresh headache for first-time buyers trying to raise the deposit for a home, even though mortgage rates remain at record low levels.But some fundamental issues remain for the UK housing market that will affect the chances of people being able to buy or sell in the longer term.Firstly, the UK remains rather obsessed with the idea of borrowing to own a home compared with the rest of Europe.Ownership levels, for mortgaged properties, are higher than most of the EU with the exception mainly of Scandinavian countries.Yet there is widespread agreement that there are not enough homes being built to match this demand.The number of new homes being built and finished fell then stalled during the financial crisis. Only now do builders say it is starting to pick up again, helped in part by government schemes aimed at kick-starting the market.But the pace of building means the housing stock is not keeping up with population growth.Looking to the future, properties are going to have fewer people living in them, partly owing to the fact we are living for longer - creating even more of a squeeze for young people hoping to buy a home of their own.</body>

      <title>What happens in a US debt default?</title>
      <description>What happens if the US stops paying its bills?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24453400</url>
      <date>1381418348</date>
      <body>If US politicians cannot agree to raise the borrowing limit, the US could default on its debt by the end of October.The US Treasury has issued a dire warning of the possible consequences."There might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse," it said in a recent report.But how can the world's largest economy stop paying its bills?Here's what happens when the tap is turned off.At its most basic level, a default is when a person or an entity cannot repay a debt on time. For instance, when a person can't make a payment on a mortgage or a car loan.When a country does this, it's known as a sovereign default. This is when the country cannot repay its debt, which typically takes the form of bonds.So if the US were to default, it would essentially stop paying the money it owed US Treasury bond holders.A quick refresher: the US government spends more money than it collects in taxes. So to make up the shortfall it raises funds by asking investors to buy US Treasury bonds. Investors, such as the Chinese government and pension funds, do this because these bonds are seen as a safe place to invest money.No one really knows exactly what would happen, but the likelihood is that markets around the world would plunge and global interest rates would rise.This is because if the US government could not repay the money it owed bondholders, the value of the bonds would decrease. And the yield - the return the government pays to an investor - would rise. This is because it would be perceived as a less safe investment.This would prompt interest rates around the world, which are often tied to those of US Treasuries, to spike.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that if a deal to increase the nation's borrowing isn't reached, the Treasury will exhaust the current extraordinary measures being used to pay the nation's bills by 17 October. These bills include not just the interest on bonds but things like Social Security and veteran benefits.Mr Lew has insisted no one really knows what will happen if and when the money runs out.The US Treasury will still be taking in revenue in the form of tax receipts, so it could pay some bills, but possibly not all of them.The most obvious option - to prioritise payments to bondholders so that the US would not be in default - has been ruled out by the Obama administration, and might technically be illegal, according to a study by Columbia Law professors.Ideally, though, the Treasury would use the money from tax receipts - which would still be flowing into its coffers after the debt ceiling is breached - to pay only the interest it owes on bonds that have already been issued.Strangely, no one really knows exactly how it works.Each day, the US Treasury receives a little over two million bills from various federal agencies.According to analysts at Credit Suisse, there are three main offices that pay those bills: the Department of Defense Disbursing Offices, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and the Financial Management Service.Technically, the payment systems can be turned on - to make payments - or off - but not much else.If prioritisation were possible, the US Treasury would probably turn off the tap at the Department of Defense Disbursing Offices and the Financial Management Service. That would leave the Bureau of Fiscal Service, known colloquially as the Fedwire, which pays money to bondholders.There are quite a few coming up in the next month; the biggest ones are due on 1 November.After 17 October, the US government will only have around 68% of the funds it needs to pay its bills for the next month, according to a report by the Bipartisan Policy Center.This means that technically, the government could continue to pay some bills.However, daily revenue intake can fluctuate wildly, making it difficult to plan.Not really.There are three examples in US history that come close to default, with the most recent occurring in 1979.Then, the US Treasury inadvertently defaulted on $122m due to what it said was a word processing error.Though the error was quickly fixed, and even though $122m was a tiny fraction of the $800bn in debt that the Treasury had at the time, a study found that the mini-default raised the cost of borrowing by 0.6%, or $6bn a year.The other two instances, in 1933 and in 1790, both involve defaults akin to the current situation in Greece, when creditors were forced to take less money than what they were owed. Some economists have defined this as a default, but it's murky territory.</body>

      <description>Should France follow the UK on Sunday trading?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24458571</url>
      <date>1381401662</date>
      <body>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle. But how has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society and do the French really have anything to fear?In November 1993, protesters from across much of the UK (although not Scotland) were confident they could keep big shops closed on Sundays.Outside Parliament they raised placards reading "Don't give in to supermarket greed" and "No government can change the laws of God".Things always appeared very different across the Channel. The French had always seemed to grasp the notion of work-life balance - in British imagination at least, reserving their weekends for red wine and serene lunches.Not everybody in the UK shared that desire for a day of rest, however. "About 50 years ago Sundays were completely dead," says Joe Moran, a cultural historian.Once, pubs had to close between 3-7pm on a Sunday, and theatres and cinemas were closed altogether. Those rules were steadily relaxed in the years that intervened, but by the early 90s most shops were still banned from trading on Sundays.Michael Schluter, founder of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wanted to keep it that way, and lobbied MPs to support his movement. In December 1993, a vote in the House of Commons saw Schluter's vision defeated by just 18 votes. The following year all restrictions were removed from small shops, and those "over 280 square metres" in size were allowed to trade for six hours each Sunday.Today you only need to stand in a DIY superstore in a desolate retail park on a Sunday morning to see how things have changed. Customers gather in the store in the half-hour "browsing time" before the tills open, glancing over expectantly, ready to pounce. Their day is built around a visit to a big shop."It's fairly obvious that Sunday is a huge trading day in this country in spite of the fact that it's limited to six hours," says Richard Perks of market research firm Mintel.The British Retail Consortium says it is second only to Saturday for footfall and total sales - and is the biggest day in terms of hourly sales, as customers try to squeeze their shopping into the six hour window.While the UK has opened its shops on Sunday since 1994, the French have managed to keep most of theirs closed.It's easy to conjure up a vision of a stereotypical French Sunday and imagine families hiking through the Fontainebleau forest, cycling to the Bois de Boulogne park, or rounding off their poulet roti with a freshly baked tarte aux fraises.But now 20 years after the British battle was settled, a similar quarrel is bubbling in France, where different groups of workers take to the streets of Paris to argue both sides of the case. Its tangled web of regulations has been dubbed a "millefeuille" by the press - after the intricate, multi-layered, French pastry of the same name.Shops in designated tourist zones can open, as can garden centres and small owner-operated shops. Those selling food are permitted half a day's trading. For the most part, though, major retailers are forced to close all day, which has angered many business leaders, and some of their workers too.Castorama and Leroy Merlin - two major French DIY chains - have chosen to defy the ban, opening their doors to shoppers on the day of rest, and their employees have backed them. They have held "Yes Weekend" demonstrations to argue for their right to work.In the UK, there seems to be a particular link between Sunday leisure and home improvement.On a typical British Sunday, streams of family cars wait patiently for a space beneath IKEA's blue and yellow facade, trundling out hours later with open boots tied down by rope.It isn't just shopping that has turned Sundays upside down. The proliferation of televised sport has also contributed to a steady erosion of the distinction between the first and second days of the weekend. Schluter is convinced that the UK has lost something along the way, however.Besides small shops that have suffered from increased competition, family ties have been damaged too, he says. "There's a psychological shift which is hard to pin down or measure… towards an attitude that is less about the value of people and relationships and more about material goods."But the example of the British reforms is an inspiration to some French campaigners. Jerome Dubus of MEDEF, a consortium of French business leaders, says that reforms are overdue. "We are one of the last countries that haven't allowed Sunday work, we are behind as usual. I was a student in England 30 years ago. On Sundays everything was closed, there was nothing going on, we didn't know what to do, and the English were attached to it. But now it has changed a lot."Of course, the unions disagree. Christophe Le Comte, of Force Ouvriere, says that the move is just another example of employers trying to exploit their staff. "They are increasing the length of the working day, they are pushing back the age of retirement," he says. Le Comte bemoans the lack of employment protection in the UK and says Sunday trading had "disastrous consequences" for small businesses in the UK.Some change looks likely. The French government has now commissioned a review into the regulations, but whether it will endorse wholesale reform or add more layers to the pastry is difficult to know.Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French columnist for the British Daily Telegraph, thinks the unions are projecting a romantic notion of life in the country that is essentially a fiction."They describe a kind of idealised France of the 1950s in which everybody has got 2.3 children, and a dog, and a little house, and the children organise Sunday lunch for all members of the family."But half the households in large cities are single person households… so what they're describing is something that doesn't exist anymore."Trish Deseine, a food writer in Paris, has a very different outlook, and the city she describes will still sound appealing to the UK's Keep Sunday Special campaigners, who are still campaigning."If you walk by Montparnasse, you will see big family reunions in the restaurants," she says. "There is a definite distinction between Sunday and the rest of the week. There is a sense of occasion. It is quieter and more family oriented. I really hope it stays this way."She does not think the restrictions can last forever, but seems determined that change should at least be delayed."Eventually France will have to come around. The French are dragging their heels into a modern way of life, but I think it is a good thing that we are standing against it."Should France follow the UK and allow shops to open on Sundays? How has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society? Do the French really have anything to fear?Comment using the form below, on Facebook or on Twitter.</body>
